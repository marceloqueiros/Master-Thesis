PART I 
    
    ITEM 1.     Business. 
  Company Overview 
  At Texas Instruments (TI), we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world.  We began operations in 1930.  We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries. We have three segments: Analog, Embedded Processing and Other.  We expect Analog and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and we therefore focus our resources on these segments. 
  Financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in  Note 16 to the financial statements captioned  Segment and geographic area data  in TI s 2013 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference to such report. Risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in Item 1A,  Risk Factors.  
  Product Information 
  Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment.  Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as  chips ) that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit.  Our products, more than 100,000 orderable parts, are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution.  This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment. 
  We sell catalog and application-specific standard semiconductor products, both of which we market to multiple customers.  Catalog products are designed for use by many customers and/or many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels.  The vast majority of our catalog products are differentiated. We also sell catalog commodity products, but they account for a small percentage of our revenue.  The life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years, with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release.  Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application.  The life cycles of ASSPs are generally determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months, although some can be used across multiple generations of customers  products. 
  Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results.  Additional information regarding each segment s products follows. 
  Analog 
  Analog semiconductors change real-world signals - such as sound, temperature, pressure or images - by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors.  Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device, whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery.  We estimate that we sell our Analog products to more than 100,000 customers.  Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly personal electronics and industrial.   
  Sales of our Analog products generated about 60 percent of our revenue in 2013.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about $40 billion in 2013.  Our Analog segment s revenue in 2013 was $7.2 billion, or about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position.  We believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.  
  Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines:  High Volume Analog   Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA). 
    
  HVAL products:  These include high-volume integrated analog products for specific applications and high-volume catalog products.  HVAL products support applications like automotive safety devices, touch screen controllers, low voltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers. 
    3 

Power products:  These include both catalog products and ASSPs that help customers manage power in electronic systems.  Our broad portfolio of Power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions, portable power conversion devices, power supply controls and point-of-load products. 
  HPA products:  These include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products.  HPA products include high-speed data converters, amplifiers, sensors, high reliability products, interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance.  HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years. 
  SVA products:  These include a broad portfolio of power management, data converter, interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products used in manufacturing a wide range of products.  SVA products support applications like video and data interface products, electrical fault/arc detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems.  SVA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.  SVA consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation in 2011. 
  Embedded Processing 
  Embedded Processing products are the  brains  of many electronic devices.  Embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.  The devices vary from simple, low-cost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment.  Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. 
  An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R D) to write software that operates on our products.  This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.  
  Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 20 percent of our revenue in 2013.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for embedded processors was about $17 billion in 2013.  Our Embedded Processing segment s revenue in 2013 was $2.4 billion. This was the number two position and represented about 14 percent of this fragmented market.   We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. 
  Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity. 
  Processor products:  These include digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors.  DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data.  Applications processors run an industry-standard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks, often communicating with other systems. 
  Microcontroller products:  Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment.  Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system and low software complexity.  Analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers.   
  Connectivity products:  Connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data, and the requirements for speed, data capability, distance and power vary depending on the application.  Our Connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements, including low-power wireless network standards like Zigbee        and other technologies like Bluetooth       , WiFi and GPS.  Our Connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products, enabling data to be collected, transmitted and acted upon.  
    4 

Other 
  Other includes revenue from our smaller product lines, such as DLP        (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and calculators.  It includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures.  We also include revenue from our baseband products and from our OMAP   TM    applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets, all of which are product lines that we previously announced we are exiting and are collectively referred to as  legacy wireless products.   Revenue from legacy wireless products declined throughout the year, and our exit from these products is complete.  Other generated $2.6 billion of revenue in 2013.  
  We also include in Other restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related charges, as these charges are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments.   Acquisition-related charges include certain fair-value adjustments, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, acquisition-related retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets.  Other also includes certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance proceeds, and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations, such as our worldwide manufacturing, facilities and procurement operations.

Market Characteristics 
  Product cycle 
  The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes.  Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature.  
  Market cycle 
  The  semiconductor cycle  is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand.  The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity.   These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle.  The semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. 
  Seasonality 
  Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation.  Our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters.  Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters. 
  Competitive landscape 
  The analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented.  As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies in each of those markets, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers.  Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. 
  We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company s product line, the strength and depth of the sales network, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and scale.  The primary competitive factors for our Analog products include design proficiency, a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance, applications and sales support, and manufacturing expertise and capacity.  The primary competitive factors for our Embedded Processing products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, installed base of software, software expertise, applications and sales support, and a product s performance, integration and power characteristics. 
  Manufacturing 
  Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer.  Each device on the wafer is tested, the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested.  The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks, with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks. 
  The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology.  Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable, and therefore less expensive, equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products, such as some of our processor products. 
  We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe.  These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.  Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation.  Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed.  In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity, potentially lowering our profit margins.  Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.   
    6 

We expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs.  To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors.  In 2013, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 35 percent of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.  
  In 2013, we closed older wafer fabrication facilities in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas.  In December 2013, we acquired an assembly/test facility in the Hi-Tech Zone of Chengdu, China, adjacent to our existing fabrication facility in Chengdu. 
    
  Inventory 
    
  Our inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand.  Because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence, we generally carry more inventory of those products than application-specific products.  Additionally, we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished-goods inventory of low-volume catalog products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand.  We also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors. 
  Design Centers  
  Our design centers provide design, engineering and product application support as well as after-sales customer service.  The design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers. 
  Customers 
  Our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs) and companies within the electronics manufacturing services industry (EMSI).  An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others.  An ODM designs and manufactures products for other companies, which then sell those products under their own brand.  EMSI companies manufacture, distribute and provide repair services for electronic products for OEMs.  In addition, we sell to customers through distributors.  In 2013, no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue. 
  Sales and Distribution 
  We market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors.  We have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of China, India and Eastern Europe over the last few years.  Distributors located around the world account for about 55 percent of our revenue.  Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers.  They also sell products from our competitors.  Our distribution network holds a mix of distributor-owned and TI-consigned inventory.  Over time, we expect this mix will continue to shift more toward consignment.  We sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers.  
  Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments  
  From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio.  We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies.  Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to us.  In September 2011, we acquired National Semiconductor Corporation. 
    
  Backlog 
  We define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time.  As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date.  Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers  individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations.  Accordingly, our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period.  Our backlog of orders was $1.06 billion at December 31, 2013, and $1.17 billion at December 31, 2012. 
    7 

Raw Materials  
  We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers.  In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers.  The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.  
  Intellectual Property  
  We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business.  We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio.  We also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future.  In general, our license agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation. 
  Our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue.  We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business. 
  We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards.  Our competitors may participate in the same initiatives.  Participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. 
  We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are  Texas Instruments  and our corporate monogram.  Other valuable trademarks include DLP        and OMAP   TM   . 
  Research and Development  
  Our R D expense was $1.52 billion in 2013, compared with $1.88 billion in 2012 and $1.72 billion in 2011.  Our primary areas of R D investment are Analog and Embedded Processing products.  
  We conduct most of our R D internally.  However, we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties, including software suppliers, universities and select external industry consortia, and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology.   
  From time to time we may terminate R D projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product.  We do not expect that all of our R D projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale, or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion.

    ITEM 1A.     Risk Factors.   
  You should read the following Risk Factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings.  These Risk Factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like TI with broad international operations.  Like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers.  Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment  
    9 

community s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community s expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.   
  Cyclicality in the Semiconductor Market May Affect Our Performance. 
  Semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue.  The semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand.  These changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities.  The results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key end-equipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects.   
  Our Margins May Vary over Time. 
  Our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix.  In addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products.  Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed.  In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.   
  The Technology Industry Is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change That Requires Us to Develop New Technologies and Products. 
  Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment.  We require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles.  Moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured.  As a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products.  There also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well-received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.   
  We Face Substantial Competition That Requires Us to Respond Rapidly to Product Development and Pricing Pressures. 
  We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate.  We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate.  Certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products.  The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors.   
  Our Performance Depends in Part on Our Ability to Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights and to Develop and License New Intellectual Property. 
  Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio.  There can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others.  To the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable.  The lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims.   
  With regard to our own intellectual property, we actively enforce and protect our rights.  However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. 
  We benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements.  The amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses.  There is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful.  Future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees.  Additionally,  
    10 

consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue.  Royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements.   
  A Decline in Demand in Certain Markets Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Demand for Our Products and Results of Operations. 
  Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the  personal electronics market, particularly the mobile phone sector, and from sales to industrial customers.  Decline in one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition.   
  Our Global Operations Subject Us to Complex Laws, Regulations and Policies and Risks Associated with  International Political, Economic or Other Conditions. 
  We have facilities in 35 countries worldwide.  About 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; in particular, shipments of products into China typically represent a large portion of our revenue.  Our global operations subject us to complex U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and policies relating to, for example, trade and export controls, anti-bribery, antitrust and privacy.  Violations of or changes in these laws, regulations and policies could result in fines, penalties, and sanctions that could adversely affect our results of operations.  Operating internationally also exposes us to political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate.  Any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results.  Additionally, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Natural Events in the Locations in Which We or Our Customers or Suppliers Operate. 
  We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations.  In addition, our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations.  A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. 
  The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by Any of Our Largest Customers Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. 
  We generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide.  The loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our Results of Operations Could be Adversely Affected by Our Distributors  Promotion of Competing Product Lines or Our Distributors  Financial Performance. 
  In 2013, about 55 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors.  Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products.  Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. 
  Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if a Customer or a Distributor Suffers a Loss with Respect to Our Inventory. 
  We have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and for some distributors.  If a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. 
    
    11 

Incorrect Forecasts of Customer Demand Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. 
  Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter s revenue forecast.  In addition, when responding to customers  requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers  demands.  These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions.  If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
  Our Performance Depends on the Availability and Cost of Raw Materials, Utilities, Critical Manufacturing Equipment, Manufacturing Processes and Third-Party Manufacturing Services. 
  Our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of some of our customers and suppliers, require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available.  Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements.  Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free.  Additionally, our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 
  Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations.  We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits.  We also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development.  A limited number of third parties perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of them.  Reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties  inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us. 
  Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in Tax-Related Matters. 
  We have facilities in 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities.  Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate.   
  In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.  Changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations.  We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.  Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations.  Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year.  If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change.  
  Our Operations Could be Affected by Changes in Environmental, Safety and Health Laws and Regulations. 
  We are subject to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, particularly those in which we manufacture our products.  If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability.  Furthermore, should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business, particularly if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products.  There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.  
  Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in the Financial Markets. 
  We maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company.  Our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans.  If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of  
    12 

operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments.  If our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. 
  Material Impairments of Our Goodwill or Intangible Assets Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. 
  Charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  The review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill.  A decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill.  Most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
  Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Warranty Claims, Product Recalls or Product Liability. 
    
  We could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements.  In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer.  We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims.  In addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a TI part.  In such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall.  Costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   
  Our Continued Success Depends in Part on Our Ability to Retain and Recruit a Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive Environment. 
  Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. 
  Our Debt Could Affect Our Operations and Financial Condition. 
    
  From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under Item 1A, many of which are beyond our control.  In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations, or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity, or the disposition of assets. 
    
  Our Ability to Successfully Implement Business and Organizational Changes Could Affect Our Business Plans and Results of Operations. 
    
  From time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives.  Our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results.  For example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition.  Further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. 
    
    13 

Our Operating Results and Our Reputation Could be Adversely Affected by Breaches of Our Information Technology Systems. 
    
  Breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism could compromise our information technology networks and result in unauthorized release of our, our customers  or our suppliers  confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation.

    Portions of the facilities are leased and owned.  This may include land leases, particularly for our non-U.S. sites. 
       
  Our facilities in the United States contained approximately 15.6 million square feet at December 31, 2013, of which approximately 0.8 million square feet were leased.  Our facilities outside the United States contained approximately 11.4 million square feet at December 31, 2013, of which approximately 2.0 million square feet were leased. 
    
  At the end of 2013, we occupied substantially all of the space in our facilities.   
    
  Leases covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 5 years.  We believe our current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended purpose and our current and foreseeable future needs.

ITEM 3.     Legal Proceedings. 
    
  We are involved in various inquiries and proceedings regarding laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.  These matters involve various parties, including government agencies and, in certain cases, other potentially responsible parties.  Although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, we believe that the amount of our liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  The Internal Revenue Code requires that companies disclose in their Form 10-K whether they have been required to pay penalties to the Internal Revenue Service for certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose.  We have not been required to pay any such penalties.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
    1.  Description of business and significant accounting policies and practices 
    
  Business 
  At Texas Instruments (TI), we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have   two   reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows:  

Analog   consists of the following major product lines: High Volume Analog   Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA). SVA consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation (National) in 2011. 
                
    Embedded Processing   consists of the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity. 
       
  We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. As a result of our decision to exit certain product lines, Other also includes our baseband products and our OMAP  applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets. These products, which we refer to as  legacy wireless products,  were part of our former Wireless segment. The Wireless segment was eliminated effective January 1, 2013. To conform to this revised reporting structure, we filed a Form 8-K on May 3, 2013, to recast prior period segment information presented in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. See Note 16 for additional information on our business segments. 
    
  Basis of presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.  
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods  financial statements to conform to the   2013   presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. 
    
  In September 2011, we completed the acquisition of National. We accounted for this transaction under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805   Business Combinations, and the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of National from the date of acquisition. See Note 2 for more information.  
    
  Revenue recognition 
  We recognize revenue from direct sales of our products to our customers, including shipping fees, when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized consistent with the principles discussed above, but delivery occurs when the customer pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Estimates of product returns for quality reasons and of price allowances, which are based on historical experience, product shipment analysis and customer contractual arrangements, are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances include volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. 
    
  We recognize revenue from direct sales of our products to our distributors, net of allowances, consistent with the principles discussed above. Title transfers to the distributors at delivery or when the products are pulled from consignment inventory, and payment is due on our standard commercial terms; payment terms are not contingent upon resale of the products.     We calculate credit allowances based on historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. For instance, we sell to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities they may have. To estimate allowances, we use statistical percentages of revenue, determined quarterly, based upon recent historical adjustment trends. We also provide allowances for certain growth-based incentives. 
    
  We provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slow-selling or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor s purchases from us. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor s on-hand inventory, we may credit them for the difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor s on-hand inventory of that product. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner.  
    6    

We determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees. We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable. Where royalties are based on a percentage of licensee sales of royalty-bearing products, we recognize royalty revenue by applying this percentage to our estimate of applicable licensee sales. We base this estimate on historical experience and an analysis of each licensee s sales results. Where royalties are based on fixed payment amounts, we recognize royalty revenue ratably over the term of the royalty agreement. Where warranted, revenue from licensees may be recognized on a cash basis. 
    
  We include shipping and handling costs in COR. 
    
  Advertising costs 
  We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was   $46 million   in   2013  ,   $46 million   in   2012   and   $43 million   in   2011  . 
    
  Restructuring charges 
  Restructuring charges may consist of voluntary or involuntary severance-related charges, asset-related charges and other costs due to exit activities. We recognize voluntary termination benefits when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement.  We recognize involuntary severance-related charges depending on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. If the former, we recognize the charges once they are probable and the amounts are estimable. If the latter, we recognize the charges once the benefits have been communicated to employees.  
    
  Restructuring activities associated with assets are recorded as an adjustment to the basis of the asset, not as a liability. When we commit to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, we accelerate the recognition of depreciation to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. When an asset is held to be sold, we write down the carrying value to its net realizable value and cease depreciation. Restructuring actions may be viewed as an impairment indicator requiring testing of the recoverability of intangible assets, including goodwill. 
    
  Income taxes 
  We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  
    
  Other assessed taxes 
  Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our statements of income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. 
    
  Earnings per share (EPS) 
  Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our restricted stock units (RSUs), are considered to be participating securities and the two-class method is used for purposes of calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and, therefore, is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below.   
    
    7    

Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): 

There were   no   potentially dilutive securities to exclude from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during 2013. Potentially dilutive securities representing   52 million   and   24 million   shares of common stock that were outstanding during   2012   and   2011  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
    
  Investments 
  We present investments on our balance sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments. Specific details are as follows: 

Cash equivalents and short-term investments:   We consider investments in debt securities with maturities of   90   days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in debt securities with maturities beyond   90   days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns.   
                
    Long-term investments:   Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities.  
                
    Classification of investments:   Depending on our reasons for holding the investment and our ownership percentage, we classify investments in securities as available for sale, trading, or equity- or cost-method investments, which are more fully described in Note 9. We determine cost or amortized cost, as appropriate, on a specific identification basis. 
       
  Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. Consigned inventory was   $202 million   and   $169 million   as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
    
  We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A specific allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. Remaining inventory includes a salability and obsolescence allowance based on an analysis of historical disposal activity. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. 
    
  Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles and other capitalized costs 
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease  
    8    

term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. 
    
  Impairments of long-lived assets 
  We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. 
    
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles 
  Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value including goodwill. See Note 10 for additional information. 
    
  Foreign currency 
  The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historic exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI E. 
    
  Derivatives and hedging 
  In connection with the issuance of variable-rate long-term debt in May 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows related to interest payments. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were credited or charged to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (AOCI). We repaid this long-term debt in the second quarter of 2013, and this interest rate swap was settled for   no   gain or loss. In association with the issuance of long-term debt, we use financial derivatives such as treasury rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. 
    
  We also use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. 
    
  We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 
    
  Changes in accounting standards 
  In January 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. This standard clarifies that a previously-issued standard on disclosure requirements relating to offsetting (or netting) financial instruments applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and certain securities lending transactions. This standard was effective as of the first quarter of 2013 and did not have a material impact on our financial disclosures as the derivatives to which it applies are not significant.  
    
  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This standard requires an entity to disclose information about amounts reclassified out of AOCI. This standard was effective as of the first quarter of 2013. See Note 15 for the required disclosure.

2.  Acquisition-related charges 
    
  We incurred various costs as a result of the 2011 acquisition of National that are included in Other, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. These total acquisition-related charges are as follows:  

Acquisition charges 
  The amount of recognized amortization of intangible assets resulting from the National acquisition is based on estimated useful lives. See Note 10 for additional information. 
    
  Retention bonuses reflect amounts paid to former National employees who fulfilled agreed-upon service period obligations and were recognized ratably over the required service period.   
    
  Stock-based compensation was recognized for the accelerated vesting of equity awards upon the termination of employees, with additional compensation being recognized over the applicable vesting period for the remaining grantees. 
    
  Severance and other benefits costs were for former National employees who were terminated after the closing date. These costs totaled   $70 million   for the year ended December 31, 2011, with   $41 million   in charges related to change of control provisions under existing employment agreements and   $29 million   in charges for announced employment reductions affecting about   350   jobs. All of these jobs were eliminated by the end of 2012 as a result of redundancies and cost efficiency measures, with   $16 million   of additional expense recognized in 2012. Of the   $86 million   in cumulative charges recognized through December 31, 2013,   $3 million   was paid in 2013,   $65 million   was paid in 2012 and   $14 million   was paid in 2011. The remaining   $4 million   will be paid in future years. 
    
  Transaction and other costs include various expenses incurred in connection with the National acquisition. In 2011, we also incurred bridge financing costs.  
    
  COR 
  In 2011, we discontinued using one of National s distributors. We acquired the distributor s inventory at fair value, resulting in an incremental charge of   $21 million   to COR upon sale of the inventory in 2012.   
    
  At acquisition, we recognized costs associated with the adjustments to write up the value of acquired inventory and property, plant and equipment to fair value. These costs are in addition to the normal expensing of the acquired assets based on their carrying or book value prior to the acquisition. The total fair-value write-up of   $96 million   for the acquired inventory was expensed as that inventory was sold. The total fair-value write-up for the acquired property, plant and equipment was   $436 million  . In the fourth quarter of 2011, depreciation was   $15 million  . It continues at a declining rate and is no longer separately disclosed as an acquisition-related charge. 
    
    10    

3.  Restructuring charges/other 
    
  Restructuring charges/other is comprised of the following components: 

Restructuring charges/other are recognized in Other. Restructuring actions related to the acquisition of National are discussed in Note 2 and the associated costs are reflected in the Acquisition charges line of our Consolidated statements of income. 
    
  2013 actions    
  In January 2014, we announced cost-saving actions in Embedded Processing and in Japan to reduce expenses and focus our investments on markets with greater potential for sustainable growth and strong long-term returns, which we expect to be substantially complete by mid-2015. Cost reductions include the elimination of about   1,100   jobs worldwide. Total restructuring charges related to these actions are expected to be about   $80 million  , all of which will be severance and related benefit costs. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded restructuring charges of   $49 million   related to the action in Embedded Processing, and the remainder related to Japan is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2013,   no   payments related to these restructuring charges have been made. 
    
  2012 Wireless action  
  In 2012, we announced a restructuring of our Wireless business to reduce expenses and focus our investments on markets with greater potential for sustainable growth and strong long-term returns. This action is now complete, eliminating about   1,700   jobs worldwide. We recognized   $389 million   in cumulative restructuring charges, including a   $90 million   impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2013,   $180 million   has been paid to terminated employees for severance and benefits.  
    
  Prior actions 
  In 2012, we announced closure of   two   older semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas, and Hiji, Japan. Each facility employed about   500   people. We recognized   $200 million   in cumulative restructuring charges related to these closures with both complete by the end of 2013. As of December 31, 2013,   $97 million   has been paid to terminated employees for severance and benefits. 
    
  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we carried immaterial liabilities related to actions commenced in 2008 and 2009. The related expense was recognized in periods prior to 2011. 
    11    

The table below reflects the changes in accrued restructuring balances associated with these actions: 

(a)   Reflects charges for goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation, impacts of postretirement benefit plans and accelerated depreciation.  
    
  The accrual balances above are primarily a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment.  
    
  Other 
  Gain on technology transfer 
  During the second quarter of 2013, we entered into an agreement to transfer wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This technology was associated with the former Wireless business, and we recognized a gain of   $315 million   on this transfer. 
    
  Gain on transfer of Japan substitutional pension 
  During the third quarter of 2012, we transferred the obligations and assets of the substitutional portion of our Japan pension plan to the government of Japan, resulting in a net gain of   $144 million  . See Note 11 for additional details. 
    
    4.  Losses associated with the 2011 earthquake in Japan  
    
  In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck near our semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Japan. Our manufacturing site in Miho suffered substantial damage. We maintain earthquake insurance policies in Japan for limited coverage for property damage and business interruption losses.  
    
  In 2011, we incurred cumulative gross operating losses of   $101 million   related to the earthquake and associated events in Japan. These losses related to property damage, the underutilization expense we incurred from having our manufacturing assets only partially loaded and costs associated with recovery teams assembled from across the world. Gross operating losses did not comprehend any lost revenue. 
    
  These losses were offset by   $36 million   in cumulative insurance proceeds related to property damage claims, of which   $13 million   was received in 2012 and   $23 million   was received in 2011. Almost all of these costs and proceeds are included in COR in our Consolidated statements of income and are recorded in Other.  
    
    12    

In addition, we recognized   $172 million   in cumulative insurance proceeds through December 31, 2012, of which   $135 million   was received in 2012 and   $37 million   was received in 2011, related to business interruption claims. These proceeds are recorded as revenue in our Consolidated statements of income and in Other.  
    
  In the third quarter of 2012, we completed discussions with our insurers and their advisors. All claims related to these events have been settled and the proceeds received. 
    
    5.  Stock-based compensation 
    
  We have stock options outstanding to participants under various long-term incentive plans. We also have assumed stock options that were granted by companies that we later acquired. Unless the options are acquisition-related replacement options, the option price per share may not be less than   100 percent   of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Substantially all the options have a   ten  -year term and vest ratably over   four   years. Our options generally continue to vest after the option recipient retires. 
    
  We also have RSUs outstanding under long-term incentive plans.   Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on the vesting date  , which is generally   four   years after the date of grant. Upon vesting, the shares are issued without payment by the grantee. Beginning with 2013 grants, RSUs generally continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of most RSUs receive an annual cash payment equal to the dividends paid on our common stock. 
    
  We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under various director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred compensation accounts established for such directors. 
    
  We also have an employee stock purchase plan under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is   85 percent   of the fair market value on the exercise date, and options have a   three  -month term. 
    
  Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:  

These amounts include expense related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our employee stock purchase plan and are net of expected forfeitures. 
    
  We issue awards of non-qualified stock options generally with graded vesting provisions (e.g.,   25 percent   per year for   four   years). Generally, we recognize the related compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for expected forfeiture activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis.  
    
  Our RSUs generally vest   four   years after the date of grant. We recognize the related compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, adjusting for expected forfeiture activity. Beginning with 2013 grants, RSUs issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis.  
    
    13    

Fair-value methods and assumptions 
  We account for all awards granted under our various stock-based compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the   Black-Scholes option-pricing model    with the following weighted average  assumptions. 

We determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates.  
    
  We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling   ten  -year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available. 
    
  Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for   zero  -coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. 
    
  Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. 
    
  The fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. 
    
  Our employee stock purchase plan is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount. 
    
  Long-term incentive and director compensation plans 
  Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans during   2013   were as follows: 

The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the years   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was   $33.70  ,   $31.60   and   $33.20   per share, respectively. For the years ended   December 31, 2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , the total grant date fair value of shares vested from RSU grants was   $98 million  ,   $120 million   and   $155 million  , respectively. 
    
    14    

Summarized information about stock options outstanding at   December 31, 2013  , is as follows: 

During the years ended   December 31, 2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , the aggregate intrinsic value (i.e., the difference in the closing market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price paid by the optionee) of options exercised was   $427 million  ,   $244 million   and   $231 million  , respectively. 
    
  Summarized information as of   December 31, 2013  , about outstanding stock options that are vested and expected to vest, as well as stock options that are currently exercisable, is as follows: 

(a)   Includes effects of expected forfeitures of approximately   1 million   shares. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was   $969 million  . 
    
  As of   December 31, 2013  , the total future compensation cost related to equity awards not yet recognized in the Consolidated statements of income was   $348 million  , consisting of   $109 million   related to unvested stock options and   $239 million   related to unvested RSUs. The   $348 million   is expected to be recognized as follows:   $173 million   in 2014,   $119 million   in 2015,   $50 million   in 2016 and   $6 million   in 2017. 
    
  Director deferred compensation 
  Directors who retire or resign from the board may receive stock distributions for compensation they elected to defer. For these stock distributions, we issued treasury shares of   12,909   in   2013  ,   6,592   in   2012   and   8,061   in   2011  . Director deferred stock activity during   2013   was as follows: 

Employee stock purchase plan 
  Options outstanding under the employee stock purchase plan at   December 31, 2013  , had an exercise price of   $36.64   per share, which is   85 percent   of the fair market value of TI common stock on the date of automatic exercise. Of the total outstanding options,   none   were exercisable at year-end   2013  . 
    
    15    

Employee stock purchase plan transactions during   2013   were as follows: 

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the employee stock purchase plans during the years   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   was   $5.71  ,   $4.52   and   $4.59   per share, respectively. During the years ended   December 31, 2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , the total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was   $13 million  ,   $13 million   and   $10 million  , respectively. 
    
  Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares 
  Our current practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. We settled stock option plan exercises and issued director deferred shares using treasury shares of   47,907,017   in   2013  ,   25,064,951   in   2012   and   27,308,311   in   2011  ; and previously unissued common shares of   none   in   2013  ,   180,955   in   2012   and   390,438   in   2011  . 
    
  Upon vesting of RSUs, we issued treasury shares of   4,280,559   in   2013  ,   3,187,490   in   2012   and   3,748,623   in   2011  ; and previously unissued common shares of   none   in   2013  ,   4,593   in   2012  , and   73,852   in   2011  . 
    
  Shares available for future grants and reserved for issuance are summarized below: 

(a)   Includes   129,264   shares credited to directors  deferred stock accounts that settle in shares of TI common stock. These shares are not included as grants outstanding at   December 31, 2013  . 
    
  Effect on cash flows 
  Cash received from the exercise of options was   $1.314 billion   in   2013  ,   $523 million   in   2012   and   $690 million   in   2011  . The related net tax impact realized was   $25 million  ,   $56 million   and   $45 million  , which includes excess tax benefits realized of   $80 million  ,   $38 million   and   $31 million  , in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
    
    6.  Profit sharing plans 
    
  Profit sharing benefits are generally formulaic and determined by one or more subsidiary or company-wide financial metrics. We pay profit sharing benefits primarily under the company-wide TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan. This plan provides for profit sharing to be paid based solely on TI s operating margin for the full calendar year. Under this plan, TI must achieve a minimum threshold of   10 percent   operating margin before any profit sharing is paid. At   10 percent   operating margin, profit sharing will be   2 percent   of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is   20 percent   of eligible payroll, which is paid only if TI s operating margin is at or above   35 percent   for a full calendar year. 
    
  We recognized   $161 million  ,   $96 million   and   $143 million   of profit sharing expense under the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
    
    16    

7.  Income taxes 
    
  Income before Income Taxes 

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 

To conform with current period reporting, we reclassified   $571 million   of 2012 prepaid taxes associated with intercompany profit in ending inventory from Current assets: Deferred income taxes to Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In the Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes table above, this change resulted in a reclassification of approximately   $65 million   and   $174 million   for 2012 and 2011, respectively, from the deferred provision to the current provision.  
    
  Principal reconciling items from income tax computed at the statutory federal rate follow: 

The total provision for   2013   in the reconciliation above includes   $79 million   of discrete tax benefits primarily for the reinstatement of the U.S. R D tax credit retroactive to   2012  . Included in the Non-U.S. effective tax rates reconciling item are tax benefits from tax holidays of   $40 million  ,   $51 million   and   $18 million   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. The tax benefits relate to our operations in Malaysia and the Philippines, and expire in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The total provision for 2012 includes   $252 million   of discrete tax benefits primarily for additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2011.  
    
    17    

The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: 

The deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on the Consolidated balance sheets as follows: 

We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. In   2013  , we recognized a net decrease of   $2 million   in our valuation allowance, due to valuation allowances on unutilized tax credits.  
    
  We have U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately   $124 million  ,   none   of which will expire before the year 2023. 
    
  A provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend 
  payments from these subsidiaries are expected to result in additional tax liability. The remaining undistributed earnings of approximately   $6.87 billion   at   December 31, 2013  , have been indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.; therefore, no U.S. tax provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings. The indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are primarily invested in tangible assets such as inventory and property, plant and equipment. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 
    
  Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were   $569 million  ,   $171 million   and   $902 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
    
    18    

Uncertain tax positions 
  We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements, we must determine that it is  more likely than not  that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI E. 
    
  The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are summarized as follows: 

The liability for uncertain tax positions and the interest payable are components of Deferred credits and other liabilities on our   December 31, 2013  , Consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  All of the   $91 million   liability for uncertain tax positions as of   December 31, 2013  , are positions that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized,   $76 million   of existing deferred tax assets would also be realized, related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation. Regarding the   $91 million   liability: 

About   $55 million   of the liability represents uncertain tax positions for tax years in jurisdictions in which audit assessments have not been made. The liability is primarily related to transfer pricing issues for which procedures for relief from double taxation will mitigate the tax rate impact of any difference between the actual tax assessments and our estimates. The increase in the liability for transfer pricing issues for the next 12 months is expected to be about   $6 million  . 

About   $36 million   of the liability represents audit assessments subject to ongoing procedures for relief from double taxation. Settlement of the   $36 million   is subject to timely completion of the tax treaty processes and some portion of that liability may be settled within the next 12 months. Settlement would not have a significant tax rate impact, as the tax rates of the counterparty jurisdictions are similar. 
       
  Within the   $184 million   liability for uncertain tax positions as of   December 31, 2012  , are uncertain tax positions totaling   $159 million   that, if recognized, would impact the tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized,   $78 million   of deferred tax assets would also be realized, primarily related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2013  , the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2010 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2009 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation and the review of refunds claimed on amended returns for years prior to 2010. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2004 through 2009. 
    
  In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the U.S., our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2006. 
    
    19    

8.  Financial instruments and risk concentration 
    
  Financial instruments 
  We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, the fair value of which was not material as of   December 31, 2013  . Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of   December 31, 2013  , had a notional value of   $459 million   to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including   $211 million   to sell Japanese yen,   $120 million   to sell euros and   $33 million   to sell British pound sterling. Prior to the second quarter of   2013  , we also held interest rate swaps. See Note 12 for more details. 
    
  Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our postretirement plan assets and deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 9 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. 
    
  Risk concentration 
  Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings.  
    
  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Details of these Accounts receivable allowances are as follows: 

9.  Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities 
    
  Debt and equity investments 
  We classify our investments as available for sale, trading, equity method or cost method. Most of our investments are classified as available for sale.  
    
  Available-for-sale and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices, broker quotes or, when necessary, financial models. See fair-value discussion below. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated balance sheets. We record other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities in OI E in our Consolidated statements of income.  
    
  We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG A.  
    
  Our other investments are not measured at fair value but are accounted for using either the equity method or cost method. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are reflected in OI E based on our ownership share of the investee s financial results. Gains and losses on cost-method investments are recorded in OI E when realized or when an impairment of the investment s value is warranted based on our assessment of the recoverability of each investment.

Details of our investments are as follows:  

At   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , we had no significant unrealized gains or losses associated with our available-for-sale investments. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments for the years ended   December 31, 2013   and   2012  . During the third quarter of 2012, we sold all of our remaining investments in auction-rate securities. 
    
  For the years ended   December 31, 2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were   $4.25 billion  ,   $2.20 billion   and   $3.55 billion  , respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not significant. 
    
  The following table presents the aggregate maturities of investments in debt securities classified as available for sale at 
  December 31, 2013  : 

Gross realized gains and losses from sales of long-term investments were not significant for   2013  ,   2012   or   2011  . Other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of these investments recognized in OI E were   $5 million  ,   $7 million   and   $2 million   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
    
  Fair-value considerations 
  We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 
    
    21    

The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. 
                 Level 1   
    Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 
      Level 2   
    Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. Our Level 2 assets consist of corporate obligations and some U.S. government agency and Treasury securities. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. 
      Level 3   
    Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. 

The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  . We had   no   Level 3 assets or liabilities as of   December 31, 2013   or   2012  . These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. 

22    

The following table summarizes the change in the fair values for Level 3 assets, reflecting the sale of our remaining investments in auction-rate securities in the third quarter of   2012  : 

10.  Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by segment for the years ended   December 31, 2013   and   2012  . 

We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2013, and determined the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value was based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements. In conjunction with the restructuring action related to the Embedded Processing segment as discussed in Note 3, we performed an interim qualitative assessment of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2013. As a result, we determined no impairment was indicated. 
    
  In November 2012, as a result of unsuccessful efforts to divest certain Wireless product lines and the subsequent decision to restructure and wind down those product lines, we reassessed the recoverability of the goodwill associated with the former Wireless segment. We determined its fair value, using a discounted cash flow analysis, was less than the carrying amount and, therefore, performed the required second step of the impairment analysis to determine the amount of the impairment charge. We deducted the fair value of the former Wireless segment from the total of the estimated fair values of the segment s identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets with no carrying value. This calculation resulted in an implied negative fair value of goodwill. As a result, we recognized a non-cash, non-tax deductible impairment charge of   $90 million   for all the associated goodwill of the former Wireless segment.  We recognized this impairment in Restructuring charges/other in the Consolidated statements of income, as discussed in Note 3. There was   no   impairment of goodwill during   2011   or   2013  . As of   December 31, 2013  , the accumulated impairment of goodwill was     $90 million  . 
    
  The components of acquisition-related intangible assets as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , are as follows: 

(a)   In-process R D is not amortized until the associated project has been completed. Alternatively, if the associated project is determined not to be viable, it is expensed.  
    
    23    

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was   $336 million  ,   $342 million   and   $111 million   for   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively, primarily related to developed technology. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. Future estimated amortization of acquisition-related intangibles for the years ended December 31 is as follows:    

11.  Postretirement benefit plans 
    
  Plan descriptions 
  We have various employee retirement plans including defined benefit, defined contribution and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.  
    
  U.S. retirement plans: 
  Our principal retirement plans in the U.S. are qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, all of which were closed to new participants after November 1997; a defined contribution plan; and an enhanced defined contribution plan. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. 
    
  Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pre-tax contributions to various investment choices, including a TI common stock fund. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employee s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans, and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employee s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee s annual eligible earnings.    
    
  At   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , as a result of employees  elections, TI s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling   15 million   shares and   20 million   shares valued at   $678 million   and   $610 million  , respectively. Dividends paid on these shares for   2013   and   2012   were   $18 million   and   $16 million  , respectively. 
    
  Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was   $62 million   in   2013  ,   $70 million   in   2012   and   $55 million   in   2011  . 
    
  Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of service and the highest   five   consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. 
    
  U.S. retiree health care benefit plan: 
  U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. 
    
  Non-U.S. retirement plans: 
  We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. 
    
    24    

As of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , as a result of employees  elections, TI s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at   $15 million   and   $13 million  , respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock for   2013   and   2012   were not material. 
    
  Effect on the statements of income and balance sheets 
  Expense related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans was as follows: 

(a)   Includes non-restructuring- and restructuring-related settlement losses. 
  (b)   Transfer of Japan substitutional pension in 2012: In Japan, we maintain employee pension fund plans (EPFs) pursuant to the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). An EPF consists of two portions: a substitutional portion based on JWPIL-determined minimum old-age pension benefits similar to Social Security benefits in the United States and a corporate portion established at the discretion of each employer. Employers and employees are exempt from contributing to the Japanese Pension Insurance (JPI) if the substitutional portion is funded by an EPF. 
       
  The JWPIL was amended to permit each EPF to separate the substitutional portion and transfer those obligations and related assets to the government of Japan. After such a transfer, the employer is required to contribute periodically to JPI, and the government of Japan is responsible for future benefit payments relating to the substitutional portion. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2012, our EPF received final approval for such a separation and transferred the obligations and assets of its substitutional portion to the government of Japan. On a pre-tax basis, this resulted in a net gain of   $144 million   recorded in Restructuring charges/other on our Consolidated statements of income and included in Other, as shown in Note 3. This net gain of   $144 million   consisted of two parts - a gain of   $337 million  , representing the difference between the fair values of the obligations settled of   $533 million   and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of   $196 million  , offset by a settlement loss of   $193 million   related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in AOCI. 
    
  For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of   three   years. 
    
    25    

Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans were as follows: 

Amounts recognized on the balance sheet as of   December 31, 2013  , were as follows: 

26    

Amounts recognized on the balance sheet as of   December 31, 2012  , were as follows: 

Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about   $50 million   to our retirement benefit plans in   2014  . The amounts shown for underfunded U.S. defined benefit plans were for non-qualified pension plans. We do not fund these non-qualified plans because contributions to them are not tax deductible until the benefit is actually paid to the employee. As of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , the unfunded benefit obligations of the U.S. non-qualified plans were   $58 million   and   $61 million  , respectively. 
    
  Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were   $882 million   and   $1.01 billion   at year-end   2013   and   2012  , respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and   $2.12 billion   and   $2.23 billion   at year-end   2013   and   2012  , respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans. 
    
  The amounts recorded in AOCI for the years ended   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , are detailed below by plan type: 

The estimated amounts of net actuarial loss and unrecognized prior service cost (credit) included in AOCI as of   December 31, 2013  , that are expected to be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are:   $26 million   and   $1 million   for the U.S. defined benefit plans;   $7 million   and   $4 million   for the U.S. retiree health care plan; and   $26 million   and   ($2) million   for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans. 
    
    27    

Information on plan assets 
  We report and measure the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at fair value. The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012  , using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 9. 

28    

The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. For the U.S. plans, we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on investments in U.S. equity funds.  
    
  The only Level 3 assets in our worldwide benefit plans are certain private equity limited partnerships in our U.S. pension plan and a diversified property fund in a non-U.S. pension plan. These investments are valued using inputs from the fund managers and internal models. The following table summarizes the change in the fair values for Level 3 plan assets for the years ending   December 31, 2013   and   2012  :   

29    

Assumptions and investment policies 

We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the U.S., we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. Both the settlement approach and the yield curve approach produce a discount rate that recognizes each plan s distinct liability characteristics. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate.   
    
  Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans  investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. 
    
  The table below shows target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets. 

We intend to rebalance the plans  investments when they are not within the target allocation ranges. Additional contributions are invested consistent with the target ranges and may be used to rebalance the portfolio. The investment allocations and individual investments are chosen with regard to the duration of the obligations of each plan. About half of the assets in the retiree health care benefit plan are invested in a series of Voluntary Employee Benefit Association trusts.  
    
    30    

Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31, are as follows: 

None   of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. As of   December 31, 2013  , we do not expect to return any of the defined benefit pension plans  assets to TI in the next 12 months. 
    
  The following table shows the benefits we expect to pay to participants from the plans in the next ten years. Almost all of the payments will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. 

Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care plan at December 31 are as follows: 

A   one   percentage point increase or decrease in health care cost trend rates over all future periods would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the U.S. retiree health care plan at   December 31, 2013  , by   $22 million   or   $18 million  , respectively. The service cost and interest cost components of   2013   plan expense would have increased or decreased by   $2 million   or   $1 million  , respectively. 
    
  Deferred compensation arrangements 
  We have a deferred compensation plan that allows U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under this plan are made based on the participant s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. In connection with the National acquisition, we assumed its deferred compensation plan, consisting of obligations and matching assets held in a Rabbi trust.   
    
  As of   December 31, 2013  , our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was   $197 million   and is recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. Except for the Rabbi trust assets of   $37 million  ,     no   other assets are held in trust for the deferred compensation plans and so we remain liable to the participants. To serve as an economic hedge against changes in fair values of this liability, we invest in similar mutual funds that are recorded in Long-term investments. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related investment in SG A as discussed in Note 9.   
    
    12.  Debt and lines of credit 
    
  Short-term borrowings 
  We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of   December 31, 2013  , we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks  
    31    

that allows us to borrow up to   $2 billion   through March 2018. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of   December 31, 2013  , our credit facility was undrawn and we had   no   commercial paper outstanding. 
    
  Long-term debt 
  In May   2013  , we issued an aggregate principal amount of   $1.0 billion   of fixed-rate long-term debt, with   $500 million   due in 2018 and   $500 million   due in 2023. We also incurred   $6 million   of issuance and other related costs that are being amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt. The proceeds of the offering were   $986 million  , net of the original issuance discount and were used toward the repayment of   $1.5 billion   of maturing debt, including floating-rate notes. In connection with this repayment, we settled a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, associated with the maturing debt.   
    
  In August 2012, we issued an aggregate principal amount of   $1.5 billion   of fixed-rate long-term debt, with   $750 million   due in 2015 and   $750 million   due in 2019. The proceeds of the offering were   $1.492 billion  , net of the original issuance discount. We also incurred   $7 million   of issuance and other related costs that are being amortized to Interest and debt expense over the term of the debt.  
    
  Long-term debt outstanding as of   December 31, 2013   and   2012   is as follows: 

Interest and debt expense was   $95 million   in   2013  ,    $85 million   in   2012   and   $42 million   in   2011  . This was net of the amortization of the debt premium and other debt issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were   $102 million   in   2013  ,   $97 million   in   2012   and   $54 million   in   2011  . Capitalized interest was not material. 
    
    13.  Commitments and contingencies 
    
  Operating leases    
  We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal provisions and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Rental and lease expense incurred was   $120 million  ,   $124 million   and   $109 million   in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011  , respectively. 
    
  Capitalized software licenses 
  We have licenses for certain internal-use electronic design automation software that we account for as capital leases. The related liabilities are apportioned between Accounts payable and Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated balance sheets, depending on the contractual timing of payments. 
    
    32    

Purchase commitments 
  Some of our purchase commitments entered in the ordinary course of business provide for minimum payments.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2013  , we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases, capitalized software licenses and purchase commitments: 

Indemnification guarantees 
  We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate or accrue for any future liabilities that may result. 
    
  Warranty costs/product liabilities 
  We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Consistent with general industry practice, we enter into formal contracts with certain customers that include negotiated warranty remedies. Typically, under these agreements our warranty for semiconductor products includes   three years of coverage; an obligation to repair, replace or refund; and a maximum payment obligation tied to the price paid for our products  . In some cases, product claims may exceed the price of our products. 
    
  General 
  We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we also negotiate contingent consideration payment arrangements associated with certain acquisitions, which are recorded at fair value. 
    
  Discontinued operations indemnity 
  In connection with the 2006 sale of the former Sensors   Controls (S C) business, we have agreed to indemnify Sensata Technologies, Inc., for specified litigation matters and certain liabilities, including environmental liabilities. In a settlement with a third party, we have agreed to indemnify that party for certain events relating to S C products, which events we consider remote. We believe our total remaining potential exposure from both of these indemnities will not exceed   $200 million  . As of   December 31, 2013  , we believe future payments related to these indemnity obligations will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
    14.  Stockholders  equity 
    
  We are authorized to issue   10,000,000   shares of preferred stock.   No   preferred stock is currently outstanding. 
    
  Treasury shares acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program in   2013  ,   2012   and   2011   were   77,564,013   shares,   59,757,780   shares and   59,466,168   shares, respectively. As of   December 31, 2013  ,   $6.0 billion   of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. 
    
    33    

15.  Supplemental financial information 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net 

(a)   Includes lease income of approximately   $15 million   per year, primarily from the purchaser of a former business. As of   December 31, 2013  , the aggregate amount of non-cancellable future lease payments to be received from these leases is   $54 million  . These leases contain renewal options. Other also includes miscellaneous non-operational items such as losses related to former businesses, including settlements in   2012   and   2011  ; gains and losses from currency exchange rate changes; and gains and losses from our derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts.

    16.  Segment and geographic area data 
    
  Reportable segments 
  Our financial reporting structure is comprised of   two   reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. These reportable segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. A summary of each reportable segment follows: 

Analog     Analog semiconductors change real-world signals   such as sound, temperature, pressure or images - by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device, whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery. Analog includes the following major product lines: HVAL, Power, HPA and SVA. 
                
    Embedded Processing     Embedded Processing products are the  brains  of many electronic devices. Compared with general purpose microprocessors that perform many different tasks, embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. The devices vary from simple, low-cost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment. Embedded Processing includes the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity. 
       
  Other 
  Other includes other operating segments that neither meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments nor are they aggregated with other operating segments. These operating segments primarily include our smaller product lines, such as DLP  products, primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images; certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); and calculators. Additionally, Other includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures. We also include revenue and associated costs from our legacy wireless products, which were part of our former Wireless segment. The Wireless segment was eliminated effective January 1, 2013. To conform to this revised reporting structure, we filed a Form 8-K on May 3, 2013, to recast prior period segment information presented in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. 
    
  We also include in Other restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related charges, as these charges are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Acquisition-related charges include certain fair-value adjustments, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, acquisition-related retention bonuses and amortization of intangible  
    35    

assets. Other also includes certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs and insurance proceeds. Except for these items, we allocate all of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.  
    
  We use centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, to provide products and support to our operating segments. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments  results and, therefore, is not provided. The assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations are carried in Other.  
    
  With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. There was no significant intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Texas Instruments Incorporated 

We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Texas Instruments Incorporated s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.  
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Texas Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, and our report dated February 24, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
    
  The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. All dollar amounts in the tables in this discussion are stated in millions of U.S. dollars, except per-share amounts.  
    
    Overview 
    
  We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world.  We began operations in 1930.  We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries.  We have three segments: Analog, Embedded Processing and Other.  We expect Analog and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and we therefore focus our resources on these segments. 
  Product information 
  Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment.  Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as  chips ) that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit.  Our products, more than 100,000 orderable parts, are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution.  This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment. 
  We sell catalog and application-specific standard semiconductor products, both of which we market to multiple customers.  Catalog products are designed for use by many customers and/or many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels.  The vast majority of our catalog products are differentiated. We also sell catalog commodity products, but they account for a small percentage of our revenue.  The life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years, with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release.  Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application.  The life cycles of ASSPs are generally determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months, although some can be used across multiple generations of customers  products. 
  Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results.  Additional information regarding each segment's products follows. 
  Analog 
  Analog semiconductors change real-world signals - such as sound, temperature, pressure or images - by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors.  Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device, whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery.  We estimate that we sell our Analog products to more than 100,000 customers.  Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly personal electronics and industrial. 
  Sales of our Analog products generated about 60 percent of our revenue in 2013.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about $40 billion in 2013.  Our Analog segment's revenue in 2013 was  $7.2 billion, or about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position.  We believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. 
  Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines:  High Volume Analog   Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA). 
    
  HVAL products:  These include high-volume integrated analog products for specific applications and high-volume catalog products.  HVAL products support applications like automotive safety devices, touch screen controllers, low voltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers. 
  Power products:  These include both catalog products and ASSPs that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio of Power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions, portable power conversion devices, power supply controls and point-of-load products. 
    41    

HPA products:  These include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products.  HPA products include high-speed data converters, amplifiers, sensors, high reliability products, interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance.  HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years. 
  SVA products:  These include a broad portfolio of power management, data converter, interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products used in manufacturing a wide range of products.  SVA products support applications like video and data interface products, electrical fault/arc detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems. SVA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.  SVA consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation in 2011. 
  Embedded Processing 
  Embedded Processing products are the  brains  of many electronic devices. Embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.  The devices vary from simple, low-cost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment.  Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. 
  An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R D) to write software that operates on our products.  This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.  
  Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 20 percent of our revenue in 2013.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for embedded processors was about $17 billion in 2013.  Our Embedded Processing segment's revenue in 2013 was $2.4 billion. This was the number two position and represented about 14 percent of this fragmented market.  We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. 
  Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity. 
  Processor products:  These include digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors.  DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data.  Applications processors run an industry-standard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks, often communicating with other systems. 
  Microcontroller products:  Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment.  Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system and low software complexity.  Analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers. 
  Connectivity products:  Connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data, and the requirements for speed, data capability, distance and power vary depending on the application.  Our Connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements, including low-power wireless network standards like Zigbee        and other technologies like Bluetooth       , WiFi and GPS.  Our Connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products, enabling data to be collected, transmitted and acted upon. 
  Other 
  Other includes revenue from our smaller product lines, such as DLP        (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and calculators.  It includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures.  We also include revenue from our baseband products and from our OMAP   TM    applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets , all of which are product lines that we previously announced we are exiting and are collectively referred to as  legacy wireless products.   Revenue from legacy wireless products declined throughout the year, and our exit from these products is complete.  Other generated $2.6 billion of revenue in 2013. 
  We also include in Other restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related charges, as these charges are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments.  Acquisition-related charges include certain fair-value adjustments, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, acquisition-related retention bonuses and amortization of intangible  
    42    

assets.  Other also includes certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance proceeds, and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations, such as our worldwide manufacturing, facilities and procurement operations. 
  Product cycle 
  The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes.  Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature. 
  Market cycle 
  The  semiconductor cycle  is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand.  The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity.  These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle.  The semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. 
  Seasonality 
  Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation.  Our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters.  Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters. 
  Manufacturing  
  Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer.  Each device on the wafer is tested, the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested.  The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks, with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks. 
  The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology.  Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable, and therefore less expensive, equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products, such as some of our processor products. 
  We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe.  These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.  Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation.  Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed.  In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity, potentially lowering our profit margins.  Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins. 
  We expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs.  To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors.  In 2013, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 35 percent of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. 
  In 2013, we closed older wafer fabrication facilities in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas.  In December 2013, we acquired an assembly/test facility in the Hi-Tech Zone of Chengdu, China, adjacent to our existing fabrication facility in Chengdu. 
  Inventory 
  Our inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand.  Because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence, we generally carry more inventory of those products than application-specific products.  Additionally, we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished-goods inventory of low-volume catalog products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand.  We also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors. 
    43    

Tax considerations 
    
  We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to several types of taxes including those that are based on income, capital, property and payroll, as well as sales and other transactional taxes. The timing of the final determination of our tax liabilities varies by jurisdiction and taxing authority. As a result, during any particular reporting period we may reflect in our financial statements one or more tax refunds or assessments, or changes to tax liabilities, involving one or more taxing authorities.  
    
    Results of operations 
    
  2013 compared with 2012 
    
  Our performance in 2013 was strong, reflecting our increased focus on Analog and Embedded Processing, where the diversity and longevity of our positions are assets.  During 2013, 79 percent of our revenue came from our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing, with Analog revenue increasing 3 percent from 2012 and Embedded Processing revenue increasing 9 percent from 2012.  Operating margin for Analog was 25.8 percent, and it exceeded 30 percent during the second half of 2013.  Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 7.6 percent, a level that should increase as we continue to grow and better align resources with market opportunities.  Additionally, we completed our exit from legacy wireless products.  Our business model continues to generate strong cash flow from operations, with free cash flow for 2013 of $3 billion, or 24 percent of revenue.  During the year we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.  
    
  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure.  For a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of the purpose for providing this non-GAAP measure, see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section. 

44    

As required by accounting rule ASC 260, net income allocated to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), on which we pay dividend equivalents, is excluded from the calculation of earnings per share (EPS). The amount excluded was $36 million, $31 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
    
  On May 3, 2013, we filed a Report on Form 8-K to recast the information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, to reflect the elimination, effective January 1, 2013, of the Wireless segment.  The information in this Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD A) is presented on a basis that is consistent with that Form 8-K. 
    
  Our exit from legacy wireless products and the elimination of the Wireless segment resulted in changes to our corporate-level expense allocations, which negatively affected segment-level profitability in the year ended December 31, 2013.  We expect a similar, although less significant, effect through the end of 2014.  We allocate our corporate-level expenses, which are largely fixed, among our product lines in proportion to the operating expenses directly generated by them.  Legacy wireless products generated lower operating expenses in 2013 than 2012 because we stopped investing in them.  The corporate-level expenses allocated to those products were, therefore, proportionately lower, and the corporate-level expenses allocated to the remaining product lines were proportionately higher.  This allocation change affects the profitability of each of our segments, but does not impact operating expense or profitability trends at the consolidated level. 
    
  Throughout the following discussion of our results of operations, unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.  New products tend not to have a significant impact on our results in any given period because our revenue is derived from such a large number of products.  From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the  mix  of products shipped.  
    
    45    

Details of 2013 financial results 
  Revenue in 2013 was $12.20 billion, down $620 million, or 5 percent, from 2012 due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products. 
    
  Despite the decline in overall revenue, gross profit in 2013 of $6.36 billion was about even with 2012 due to a more favorable mix of products shipped and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs.  Gross profit margin in 2013 was 52.1 percent of revenue compared with 49.6 percent in 2012.  
    
  Operating expenses were $1.52 billion for R D and $1.86 billion for SG A.  R D expense decreased $355 million, or 19 percent, from 2012 primarily reflecting the wind-down of our legacy wireless products.  R D expense as a percent of revenue was 12.5 percent compared with 14.6 percent in 2012.  SG A expense increased $54 million, or 3 percent, from 2012 primarily due to higher variable compensation and other support costs, partially offset by reduced costs from the wind-down of our legacy wireless products.  SG A expense as a percent of revenue was 15.2 percent compared with 14.1 percent in 2012.  
    
  Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $341 million in 2013 compared with $450 million in 2012.  The charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets.  The decrease from 2012 was due to the nonrecurrence of integration-related expenses.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for detailed information. 
    
  Restructuring charges/other in 2013 was a net credit of $189 million, reflecting the $315 million gain from our transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer in the second quarter, partially offset by restructuring charges of $126 million.  This compared with a net charge of $264 million in 2012, which included restructuring and other charges of $408 million, partially offset by a $144 million gain from the transfer of the obligations and assets of a portion of our Japan pension program from the pension trust to the government of Japan. These net amounts are all included in Other.  For details on restructuring actions, see the Restructuring actions section of this MD A. 
    
  Operating profit was $2.83 billion, or 23.2 percent of revenue, compared with $1.97 billion, or 15.4 percent of revenue, in 2012.   
    
  OI E for 2013 was income of $17 million compared with $47 million for 2012. The decrease was due to lower tax-related interest income. 
    
  Interest and debt expense was $95 million compared with $85 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates on debt outstanding during the period. See Note 12 to the financial statements for more information. 
    
  The income tax provision for 2013 was $592 million compared with $176 million for the prior year.  The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, lower discrete tax benefits. The discrete tax benefits were $79 million in 2013, primarily due to the effect of the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012.  In 2012, the discrete tax benefits were $252 million, primarily due to additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to prior years. Our annual effective tax rates were 24 percent in 2013 and 22 percent in 2012.  These rates exclude the impact of the discrete tax benefits.  See Note 7 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax. 
    
  Net income was $2.16 billion, an increase of $403 million, or 23 percent, from 2012.  EPS for 2013 was $1.91 compared with $1.51 for 2012. EPS in 2013 benefited $0.06 from 2012 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. 
    
  Segment results 
    
  Analog 

46    

Analog revenue increased $196 million, or 3 percent, from 2012 primarily due to growth in Power.  Revenue from SVA and HPA also increased, but to a lesser extent.  HVAL revenue decreased primarily due to a less favorable mix of products shipped. 
    
  Operating profit was $1.86 billion, or 25.8 percent of revenue.  This was an increase of $209 million, or 13 percent, compared with 2012 primarily due to higher gross profit that benefited from higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs.  This increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Embedded Processing revenue increased $193 million, or 9 percent, compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenue from Microcontrollers, and to a lesser extent, Processors and Connectivity. 
    
  Operating profit was $185 million, or 7.6 percent of revenue.  This was an increase of $27 million, or 17 percent, compared with 2012 due to higher revenue and associated gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses.  
    
  Other 

*Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/other 
    
  Revenue from Other was $2.56 billion in 2013.  This was a decrease of $1.01 billion, or 28 percent, from 2012 primarily due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products.   
    
  Operating profit for 2013 from Other was $788 million, or 30.8 percent of revenue.  This was an increase of $623 million, or 378 percent, compared with 2012 due to lower operating expenses and Restructuring charges/other.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for more information on Restructuring charges/other.  These decreases were partially offset by lower revenue and associated gross profit. 
    
    Prior results of operations - 2012 compared with 2011 
    
  During 2012, we faced a weak demand environment, but our operations performed well and we strengthened our strategic position.  We grew our free cash flow to almost $3 billion, or 23 percent of revenue, despite lower revenue that resulted primarily from our decision to exit wireless baseband products.  Our free cash flow was the result of more of our revenue coming from Analog and Embedded Processing, which offer solid growth and high margins and have low capital needs.  During 2012, we returned 90 percent of this free cash flow to stockholders through our continued share repurchases and higher dividend payments. 
    
  Revenue in 2012 was $12.82 billion, down $910 million, or 7 percent, from 2011 primarily due to a weak demand environment.  Revenue from a full year s inclusion of SVA slightly more than offset lower revenue from wireless baseband products. 
    
  Gross profit in 2012 was $6.37 billion, a decrease of $404 million, or 6 percent, from 2011.  The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue.  Gross profit margin in 2012 was 49.6 percent of revenue compared with 49.3 percent in 2011.  
    
    47    

Operating expenses in 2012 were $1.88 billion for R D and $1.80 billion for SG A.  R D expense increased $162 million, or 9 percent, from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA.  In 2012, R D expense as a percent of revenue was 14.6 percent compared with 12.5 percent in 2011.  SG A expense increased $166 million, or 10 percent, from 2011 due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA.  In 2012, SG A expense as a percent of revenue was 14.1 percent compared with 11.9 percent in 2011.  
    
  Acquisition charges were related to the National acquisition and were $450 million in 2012 and $315 million in 2011.  The increase was due to a full year of amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
    
  Restructuring charges/other were $264 million in 2012 and $112 million in 2011.  The increase was primarily due to the restructuring of our former Wireless segment, partially offset by a $144 million gain we recognized from the Japan pension program change. 
    
  Operating profit in 2012 was $1.97 billion, or 15.4 percent of revenue, compared with $2.99 billion, or 21.8 percent of revenue, in 2011.  The decrease was due to, in decreasing order, lower gross profit, higher operating expenses, higher restructuring charges and higher acquisition charges. 
    
  OI E for 2012 was income of $47 million compared with $5 million for 2011.  The increase was primarily due to tax-related interest income. 
    
  Interest and debt expense was $85 million in 2012 compared with $42 million in 2011.  The increase was primarily due to having debt outstanding for a full year in 2012 compared with about eight months in 2011.  We issued debt in May 2011 and assumed debt in September 2011, both in connection with our acquisition of National. 
    
  The annual effective tax rate for 2012 was 22 percent, which excluded discrete tax benefits of $252 million, resulting in a total income tax provision for 2012 of $176 million compared with a total tax provision of $719 million for the prior year.  The decrease in the total tax provision was due to the combination of lower income before income taxes and the impact of discrete tax benefits.  The decrease was partially offset by the impact of the expiration of the federal research tax credit at the end of 2011.  
    
  Net income in 2012 was $1.76 billion, a decrease of $477 million, or 21 percent, from 2011.  EPS for 2012 was $1.51 compared with $1.88 for 2011.  The decline in EPS was due to lower net income.  EPS in 2012 benefited $0.03 from 2011 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. 
    
  Segment results 
    
  Analog 

Analog revenue for 2012 increased $623 million, or 10 percent, from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of SVA, and to a lesser extent, growth in Power.  Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue from HPA.  Revenue from HVAL products was about even. 
    
  Operating profit for 2012 was $1.65 billion, or 23.6 percent of revenue.  This was a decrease of $43 million, or 3 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to higher operating expenses from the inclusion of a full year of SVA, partially offset by higher gross profit. 
    
    48    

Embedded Processing   

Embedded Processing revenue for 2012 decreased $124 million, or 5 percent, compared with 2011 due to lower revenue from Processors and, to a lesser extent, a less favorable mix of Microcontrollers shipped.  The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from Connectivity.  
    
  Operating profit for 2012 was $158 million, or 7.0 percent of revenue.  This was a decrease of $229 million, or 59 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to lower gross profit, and to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses.   
    
  Other 

* Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/other 
    
  Revenue from Other was $3.57 billion in 2012.  This was a decrease of $1.41 billion, or 28 percent, from 2011 primarily due to lower revenue from wireless baseband products. 
    
  Operating profit for 2012 from Other was $165 million, or 4.6 percent of revenue.  This was a decrease of $747 million, or 82 percent, compared with 2011 due to lower revenue and associated gross profit and higher restructuring and acquisition charges.  Included in Restructuring charges/other for 2012 was a $144 million gain from the Japan pension program change.  The increase in acquisition charges was due to a full year of increased amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. 
    
  Restructuring actions 
    
  We periodically undertake restructuring actions to focus our investments on opportunities that have the best potential for sustainable growth and returns.  In January 2014, we announced cost-saving actions in Embedded Processing and in Japan to focus on markets with greater potential for sustainable growth and strong long-term returns.  Cost reductions include the elimination of about 1,100 jobs worldwide, and we expect annualized savings of about $130 million by the end of 2014.  We expect these actions to be substantially complete by mid-2015.  Total restructuring charges related to these actions are expected to be about $80 million, all of which will be severance and related benefit costs.  Additionally, in 2012 we announced a restructuring of our Wireless business and closure of two older semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas, and Hiji, Japan.  Both of these actions were complete by the end of 2013. 
    
  In 2013, restructuring charges were $126 million, which consisted of $49 million related to the action in Embedded Processing, $38 million related to the Wireless action and $39 million related to the closing of the manufacturing facilities.   Of the $126 million, $85 million was for severance and benefit costs and $41 million was for other charges.  
    
  In 2012, restructuring charges were $400 million, which consisted of $351 million related to the Wireless action and $49 million related to the closing of the manufacturing facilities.  Of the $400 million, $251 million was for severance and benefit costs and $149 million was for other charges, including a non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment of $90 million. 
    
  All of these charges are reflected on the Restructuring charges/other line and are included in Other. See Note 3 to the financial statements for more information.

Financial condition 
    
  At the end of 2013, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $3.83 billion, a decrease of $136 million from the end of 2012.   
    
  Accounts receivable were $1.20 billion at the end of 2013.  This was a decrease of $27 million compared with the end of 2012.  Days sales outstanding were 36 at the end of 2013 compared with 37 at the end of 2012. 
    
  Inventory was $1.73 billion at the end of 2013.  This was a decrease of $26 million from the end of 2012.  Days of inventory at the end of 2013 were 112 compared with 103 at the end of 2012, consistent with our target range of 105 to 115 days. 
    
    Liquidity and capital resources 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.  Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and revolving credit facilities.  Cash flow from operating activities for 2013 was $3.38 billion, about even with last year as the increase in net income was largely offset by the increase in working capital requirements. 
    
  We had $1.63 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.20 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2013.  
    
  We have a variable-rate revolving credit facility with a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2018.  This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper.  As of December 31, 2013, our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding. 
    
  In 2013, investing activities used $3 million compared with $1.04 billion in 2012.  For 2013, Capital expenditures were $412 million compared with $495 million in 2012.  Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2013, we had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $342 million.  This compared with using cash of $604 million in 2012 to make purchases of short-term investments, net of sales. 
    
  In 2013, financing activities used net cash of $3.17 billion compared with $1.95 billion in 2012.  In 2013, we received proceeds of $986 million from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.50 billion of maturing debt.  In 2012, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt  and repaid $1.38 billion of debt and commercial paper.  Dividends paid in 2013 were $1.18 billion compared with $819 million in 2012, reflecting increases in the dividend rate in each year.  In 2013, we announced two increases in our quarterly cash dividend.  During 2013, the quarterly dividend increased from $0.21 to $0.30 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $1.20 per share.  In 2013, we used $2.87 billion to repurchase 77.6 million shares of our common stock.  This compared with $1.80 billion used in 2012 to repurchase 59.8 million shares.  Employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in Cash flows from financing activities.  In 2013, these exercises provided cash proceeds of $1.31 billion compared with $523 million in 2012.  Stock option exercises in 2013 were higher than historical averages. 
    
  We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
    
  Non-GAAP financial information 
    
  This MD A includes references to free cash flow and various ratios based on that measure.  These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as Cash flow from operations). 
  The free cash flow measures were compared to the following GAAP items to determine the various non-GAAP ratios presented below and referred to in the MD A:  Revenue, Dividends paid and Stock repurchases.  Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based ratios is provided in the tables below. 
  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to investors, as well as insight into our financial performance.  These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.  
    50    

Long-term contractual obligations 

(a) 
    Long-term debt obligations include amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months.  The related interest payments are not included. 
       
           (b) 
    Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as an operating lease. 
       
           (c) 
    Includes payments under license agreements for electronic design automation software. 
       
           (d) 
    Includes contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule.  Excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements.  However, depending on when certain purchase arrangements may be cancelled, an additional $14 million of cancellation penalties may be required to be paid, which are not reflected in the table. 
       
           (e) 
    Includes an estimate of payments under this plan for the liability that existed at December 31, 2013. 
       
           (f) 
    Excluded from the table are $91 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans.  Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.  Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $50 million in 2014, but funding projections beyond 2014 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. 
       Critical accounting policies 
  In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results.  We consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the  
    51    

portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment.  If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements. 
    
  Revenue recognition 
    
  Revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, is recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales order, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, the sales amounts are fixed or determinable, and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations.   
    
  We reduce revenue based on estimates of future credits to be granted to customers.  Credits include volume-based incentives, other special pricing arrangements and product returns due to quality issues.  Our estimates of future credits are based on historical experience, analysis of product shipments and contractual arrangements with customers and distributors. 
    
  In 2013, about 55 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors.  We recognize distributor revenue net of allowances, which are management s estimates based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms.  These allowances recognize the impact of credits granted to distributors under certain programs common in the semiconductor industry whereby distributors receive certain price adjustments to meet individual competitive opportunities, or are allowed to return or scrap a limited amount of product in accordance with contractual terms agreed upon with the distributor, or receive price protection credits when our standard published prices are lowered from the price the distributor paid for product still in its inventory, or other incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities.  Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration.  We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity.  About 50 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory, and we expect this proportion to continue to grow over time.  The allowances we record against this revenue are not material. 
    
  In addition, we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging.  When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made. 
    
  Income taxes 
    
  In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. 
    
  In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain.  The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. 
    
  As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered.  If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable.  In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years.  Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods.  These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.  Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our non-U.S. operations could change.  Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. 
    
  In addition to the factors described above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on then-current tax law.  Significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates.  Retroactive changes in tax law  
    52    

enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item.  The extent to which the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements differs from the 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate is  generally due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and from U.S. tax benefits.  These lower tax rates are generally statutory in nature, without expiration and available to companies that operate in those taxing jurisdictions. 
    
  Inventory valuation allowances 
    
  Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods.  Allowances are determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual materials and parts to historical usage rates, current backlog and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age of inventory, in order to identify specific components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold.  Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products.  In addition to this specific identification process, statistical allowances are calculated for remaining inventory based on historical write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons.  Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. 
    
  Impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill 
    
  We review acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Factors considered include the underperformance of an asset compared with expectations and shortened useful lives due to planned changes in the use of the assets.  Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to estimated future undiscounted cash flows.  If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value, determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.  Additionally, in the case of intangible assets that will continue to be used in future periods, a shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized. 
    
  We review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise, such as significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates.  This impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions.  We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. 
    
  Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing. 
    
    Changes in accounting standards 
    
  See Note 1 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. 
    
    Off-balance sheet arrangements 
    
  As of December 31, 2013, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
    
    Commitments and contingencies 
    
  See Note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 

Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
    
  Foreign exchange risk 
  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting.  Our non-U.S. entities frequently own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or non-local currencies.  Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently our effective tax rate. 
    53    

We use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures.  For example, at year-end 2013, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $459 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $211 million to sell Japanese yen, $120 million to sell euros and $33 million to sell British pound sterling).  Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2012. 
    
  Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by these forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2013 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $4 million. 
    
  Interest rate risk 
  We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. 
    
  As of December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $9 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $147 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. 
    
  Equity risk 
  Long-term investments at year-end 2013 include the following: 

Investments in mutual funds - includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. 
                
    Investments in venture capital funds - includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). 
                
    Equity investments - includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. 
       
  Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value.  Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results.  Non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost.  Impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in net income.  Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.

           5.
