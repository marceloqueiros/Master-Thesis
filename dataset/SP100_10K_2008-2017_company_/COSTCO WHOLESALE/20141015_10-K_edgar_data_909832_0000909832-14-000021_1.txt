   PART I 
    Item 1 Business 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Australia, Spain, and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  COST.  
  Prior to the July 2012 acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest in our joint venture in Mexico, the financial position and results of Mexico's operations were consolidated, and the joint venture partner's share was included in "net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in the consolidated statements of income. Subsequent to the acquisition, we have included 100% of Mexico's operations within "net income attributable to Costco" in the consolidated statements of income. 
  We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2014 and 2013 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, respectively. References to 2012 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 2, 2012.  
  General 
  We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. 
  We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. 
  Our average warehouse is approximately 144,000 square feet, however our newer units tend to be slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations. 
  Marketing activities generally include community outreach programs to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members. Ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers, The Costco Connection (a magazine we publish for our members), and e-mails to members promoting selected merchandise. 
  Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier weekend closing hours. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit and credit cards, or a private label Costco credit card.  
  Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to a significantly higher number of SKUs at other retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. 
  In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchases.

  Item 1 Business (Continued) 

   The following table indicates the approximate percentage of annual net sales accounted for by major category of items: 

Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year-end: 

Our online business, which operates websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico, provides our members additional products, many not found in our warehouses. These products vary by country and include services such as photo processing, pharmacy, travel, business delivery, and membership services. Net sales for our online business were approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales. 
  We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brand-name items. 
  Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
  Membership  
  Our format allows our members to utilize their memberships at any of our worldwide Costco warehouse locations. We have two types of members: Gold Star (individual) and Business. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals to purchase products for personal use. Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence. Business members have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons) for an annual fee. Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $55 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies by country in our Other International operations. All paid memberships include a free household card.  
  Our member renewal rate was approximately   91%   in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately   87%   on a worldwide basis in   2014  . The renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. This method captures the annual membership cycle as the majority of members renew within the six months following their renewal date.

  Item 1 Business (Continued) 

   Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 

All Gold Star and Business paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and U.K., for an annual fee of approximately $110. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $750 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico) additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by country and state. At the end of   2014  , Executive members represented   39%   of eligible cardholders while they represented   38%   at the end of both   2013   and   2012  . Executive members generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase. 
  Labor 
  Our employee count was as follows: 

Approximately   14,000   employees in certain of our locations in   five   states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good. 
  Competition 
  Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location and customer service. We compete with warehouse club operations across the U.S. and Mexico (primarily Wal-Mart s Sam s Club and BJ s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations. In addition, we compete on a worldwide basis with global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kohl s and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Kroger, Trader Joe s, Whole Foods, CVS, Walgreens, and Best Buy.  
  Intellectual Property 
  We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale        series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature       . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items. 
  We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary from country to country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.

  Item 1A Risk Factors  

   The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. We could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management  '  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item     7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item     8 of this Report. 
  Business and Operating Risks 
  We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. 
  Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 83% of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2014, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 32% of U.S. net sales in 2014. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. 
  We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. 
  We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. 
  We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. In new markets, we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed and, as a result, our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. 
  Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Membership loyalty is essential to our business model. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, membership fee revenues, negatively impacting our results of operations. 
  In addition, we sell many products under our owned and exclusive Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our Kirkland Signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent  
    8 

       Table of Contents  
    
  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

   a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. 
  Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. 
  We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor shortages or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. 
  We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. 
  If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation. 
  We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates, including cloud service providers who perform activities for us. Our online business, which operates websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico, depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members  '   personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations. 
  Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and local or state level in all of our operating countries.     Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we, or those with whom we share information, fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance. 
  Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

   We are subject to payment related risks. 
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card, and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. If we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for banks' compromised card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
  We are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products which could result in illness or injury to our members, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. 
  If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children  '  s products, pet products, and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members  '   expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term. 
  We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. 
  It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins (net sales less merchandise costs) and operating income. 
  If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
  Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop online. As part of our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  Our inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse  
    10 

       Table of Contents  
    
  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

   effect on our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Market and Other External Risks 
  We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, and store hours. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.  
  General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies, sovereign debt crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events. 
  Vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. 
  We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits. 
  We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available. 
  Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. 
    11 

       Table of Contents  
    
  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

   Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. 
  We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased U.S. and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. 
  Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. 
  We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, margins, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies. 
  Legal and Regulatory Risks 
  Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  During 2014, our international operations, including Canada, generated 28% of our consolidated net sales. We plan to continue expanding our international operations. As a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., but many of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future profits and cash flows from our international operations. 
    12 

       Table of Contents  
    
  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

   Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, impairment of long-lived assets, self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. 
  Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
  We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities. 
  We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Significant changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We are, or may become involved, in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item     8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  '  s attention and resources.

   Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)  
    OVERVIEW 
  We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. 
  Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our  pricing authority    consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of sales. We believe our gasoline business draws members to our warehouses, but it has a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales relative to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin as a percentage of net sales. 
  We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows however, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult and potentially more expensive to secure, and square footage growth may become a comparatively less substantial component of sales growth. The negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. 
  Our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially influences our profitability. 
  Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. 
  Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less direct membership warehouse competition. Additionally, we operate our gasoline business only in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and U.K. 
  In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-

exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal years   2014   and   2013   were 52-week fiscal years ending on   August 31, 2014  , and   September 1, 2013  , respectively, while fiscal year   2012   was a 53-week fiscal year ending on   September 2, 2012  . Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 
  Highlights for fiscal year 2014 included: 
              
    Net sales increased 7% to $110,212, driven by a 4% increase in comparable sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014. Net and comparable sales were negatively impacted by changes in certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar; 
                
    Membership fees increased 6% to $2,428, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and  executive membership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar; 
                
    Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points;  
                
    Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points, primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems; 
                 
    Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.10, primarily  due to changes in the Canadian dollar; and

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Sales 

_______________ 
   2014 vs. 2013 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales increased $7,342 or 7% during 2014. This was attributable to a 4% increase in comparable warehouse sales, and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014. Changes in foreign currencies negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,336, or 130 basis points, compared to 2013. The negative impact was primarily due to the Canadian dollar of approximately $1,140 and the Japanese yen of approximately $311. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $364, or 35 basis points, due to a 3% decrease in average sales price per gallon. 
  Comparable Sales 
  Comparable sales increased 4% during 2014 and were primarily impacted by an increase in shopping frequency. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and gasoline prices negatively impacted comparable sales results, including the average amount spent by our members during 2014. In local currencies, International comparable sales increased 7%; 9% in Canada and 4% in our Other International segment. The increase in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations), primarily in our Other International operations. 
  2013 vs. 2012 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales increased $5,808 or 6% during 2013. This increase was attributable to a 6% increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2012 and 2013, partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2012. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $208, or 21 basis points during 2013. The negative impact was primarily due to the Japanese yen of approximately $354, partially offset by a positive impact of the Mexican peso of approximately $127. Changes in gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in net sales.

Comparable Sales 
  Comparable sales increased 6% during 2013 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in comparable sales. The increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization. 
    Membership Fees 

2014 vs. 2013 
  Membership fees increased 6% in 2014. This increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee Executive Membership program. The raising of our membership fees in fiscal 2012 positively impacted 2014 by $9. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $35 in 2014. Our member renewal rates are currently 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 87% worldwide. 
  We increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada effective November 1, 2011, for new members, and January 1, 2012, for renewal members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.  
  2013 vs. 2012 
  Membership fees increased 10% in 2013. The increase was primarily due to raising our annual membership fees and membership sign-ups at both existing and new warehouses. The fee increase had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately $119 and $37 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2012.  
    Gross Margin 

2014 vs. 2013 
  Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points. Gross margin in our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods) when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points, primarily due to increases in our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines. Fresh foods also had a positive impact as a result of higher sales penetration. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by seven basis points primarily due to a $28 LIFO inventory charge in 2014 compared to a $27 benefit in 2013 and a nonrecurring legal settlement that increased gross margin in 2013. The LIFO charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily our foods and fresh foods categories. Excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by $151 in 2014.  
  Gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of their own merchandise category sales increased seven basis points. The changes in the individual merchandise categories are consistent with the discussion above.

  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

When expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales, gross margin increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines and the LIFO charge and legal settlement discussed above. The gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased, primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries, partially offset by an increase in fresh foods. The gross margin percentage in our Other International segment increased, primarily due to fresh foods. 
  2013 vs. 2012 
  Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points. Gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased four basis points, primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods as a result of our continued investment in merchandise pricing. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points, predominately in our optical and hearing aid businesses. Additionally, gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to a $27 LIFO inventory benefit in 2013, compared to a charge of $21 in 2012, and two basis points due to a legal settlement. The LIFO benefit resulted from lower costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily hardlines. Executive Membership 2% reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points, due to increased spending by Executive Members.  
  Gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales) decreased two basis points, primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods.  
  When expressed as a percentage of the segment s own sales, gross margin increased in our U.S. operations primarily due to improvements in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The LIFO benefit and legal settlement also benefited our U.S. operations. These improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in fresh foods. The gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations was flat, resulting from a decrease in fresh foods, offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The gross margin percentage in our Other International segment decreased, primarily in fresh foods.  
    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

2014 vs. 2013 
  SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points. Excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points. This increase was largely due to an increase in central operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by our U.S. operations. Stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation in the trading price of our stock, despite a 14% reduction in the average number of RSUs granted to each participant. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for discussion of accelerated vesting. Warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point, primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our Canadian operations as a result of leveraging increased sales, partially offset by increases in employee benefit costs, primarily health care, in our U.S. operations. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our SG A expenses by $119 in 2014. 
  2013 vs. 2012 
  SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point. This increase was driven by higher stock compensation expense of three basis points, partially offset by contributions made to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in Washington State in the first quarter of 2012, with no comparable charge in 2013, which resulted in a positive impact of two basis points. Central operating costs as a percent of net sales were flat, primarily due to the benefit of lower non-equity incentive compensation costs as a result of not meeting certain internal performance targets. This was offset by higher central operating costs, predominately related to the continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by our U.S. operations. Warehouse operating costs as a percentage of net sales were flat, primarily due to leveraging payroll costs in our U.S. and Canadian operations as a result of increased net sales which was offset by increases in other operating costs, primarily employee benefits and workers' compensation.

Preopening Expenses 

Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses, development in new international markets, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. During the fourth quarter we opened our first warehouse in Spain. 
  Interest Expense 

Interest expense in 2014 primarily relates to our $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes issued in fiscal 2007 and our $3,500 of Senior notes issued in December 2012 (described in further detail under the heading  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report).  
  Interest Income and Other, Net 

2014 vs. 2013 
  The increase in interest income in 2014 was primarily driven by higher average cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances, primarily in our U.S. operations. The decrease in net foreign-currency transaction gains was primarily attributable to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year, primarily our Japanese subsidiary's U.S. dollar-denominated payables. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.  
  2013 vs. 2012 
  The decrease in interest income in 2013 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our U.S. cash balances. There was a decrease in the positive impact of net foreign-currency transaction gains resulting from the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year. This was partially offset by a positive impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to foreign exchange contracts entered into by our foreign subsidiaries, as the U.S. dollar was slightly stronger in certain international locations compared to 2012.

Provision for Income Taxes 

Our provision for income taxes for 2013 was favorably impacted by nonrecurring net tax benefits of $77, primarily due to a $62 tax benefit recorded in connection with the special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401(k) Retirement Plan. Dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  
    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7,315 and $6,124 at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $1,383 and $1,254 at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we changed our position regarding a portion of the undistributed earnings of our Canadian operations, which is no longer considered permanently reinvested. Current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial U.S. tax liability, which was recorded at the end of 2014. Canadian withholding taxes, which are creditable against federal income taxes, have also been accrued on the amount expected to be repatriated. 
  Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. This includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our Canadian operations that management continues to assert are indefinitely reinvested. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at these subsidiaries and considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,809 at August 31, 2014. 
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,984 in 2014 compared to $3,437 in 2013. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Our cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit card processing fees, and utilities. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,093 in 2014 compared to $2,251 in 2013. Our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities.   Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 
  Capital Expenditure Plans 
  We opened 30 new warehouses and one new depot in 2014 and plan to open up to 35 new warehouses in 2015, including the relocation of four warehouses.     Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our

  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

information systems, and working capital.   In 2014 we spent $1,993 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,500 to $2,700 during fiscal 2015.     These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash to be provided from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $786 in 2014 compared to $44 provided by financing activities in 2013. The primary uses of cash in 2014 were dividend payments, repurchases of common stock, and payment of withholding taxes on stock-based awards. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 primarily resulted from the proceeds of the issuance of $3,500 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which were used to fund a one-time special cash dividend of $3,049 in December 2012. These cash flows did not recur in 2014. 
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  During 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 2,915,000 and 357,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $114.45 and $96.41, totaling approximately $334 and $34, respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,721 at the end of 2014. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. 
  Dividends 
  In April 2014, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.31 to $0.355 per share. Our cash dividends paid in   2014   totaled $1.33 per share, as compared to $8.17 per share in   2013  , which included a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share. 
  Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs 
  We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 31, 2014, we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of $451, of which $381 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $381, $180 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2014 and $36 outstanding at the end of 2013. 
  The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $154. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2014 totaled $95, including $91 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.

Contractual Obligations 
  As of   August 31, 2014  , our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Includes only open merchandise purchase orders. 
              (2) 
    Includes contractual interest payments. 
              (3) 
    Operating lease obligations exclude amounts for common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by   $149   to reflect sub-lease income. 
              (4) 
    The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 
              (5) 
    Includes   $55   in asset retirement obligations and $48 in deferred compensation obligations. The total amount excludes $54 of non-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $25 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. 
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance/self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We generally recognize sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. 
  We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts earned, which is reflected in net sales. 
    25 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

We account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $750 per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. We account for this reward as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. 
  Investments 
  Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  
  Merchandise Inventories 
  Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. 
  We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. 
  Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value. 
  Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities 
  We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers  compensation, general liability, property damage, directors  and officers  liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
  Income Taxes 
  The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.  
    Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) 
  Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities, and asset and mortgage-backed securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.  
  Our Board of Directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage-backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA+.  
  Our Canadian and other international subsidiaries  investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers  acceptances and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in their local currencies.  
  We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio. At the end of   2014  , the incremental change in the fair market value was immaterial. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders  equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
  The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2014, the majority of our long-term debt is fixed rate Senior Notes, carried at $4,596. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt. 
  Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk 
  Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. 
  While we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships, there can be no assurance that this practice is effective. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of   2014   and   2013  . A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at   August 31, 2014   would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $56 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominately in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel

   for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the  normal purchases or normal sales  exception under authoritative guidance and, thus, require no mark-to-market adjustment.

   Item 9A Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2014, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   August 31, 2014  , using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   August 31, 2014  . The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation: 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the 53-week period ended September 2, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the 53-week period ended September 2, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Costco Wholesale Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated October 15, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation 
  We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2014 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992). 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August 31, 2014 and September 1, 2013, and the 53-week period ended September 2, 2012, and our report dated October 15, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) 
    Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Description of Business 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At August 31, 2014, Costco operated   663   warehouses worldwide:   468   United States (U.S.) locations (in   43   U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico),   88   Canadian locations,   33   Mexico locations,   26   United Kingdom (U.K.) locations,   20   Japan locations,   11   Korea locations,   10   Taiwan locations,   6   Australia locations, and   1   Spain location. The Company's online business operates websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest, consolidated entities in which it has made equity investments, or has other interests through which it has majority-voting control or it exercises the right to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s performance. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and other consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation. In July 2012, Costco purchased its former joint venture partner s   50%   equity interest in Costco Mexico. The Company s net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests in its operations in Mexico prior to the July 2012 acquisition of the   50%   noncontrolling interest, Taiwan, and Korea. Subsequent to the acquisition date,   100%   of Mexico s operations are included in  net income attributable to Costco.  Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 
  In 2011 and prior to the July 2012 acquisition of the   50%   noncontrolling interest in Mexico, the financial position and results of Mexico s operations were fully consolidated, and the joint venture partner s share was included in  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  
  Fiscal Year End 
  The Company operates on a   52/53   week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to   2014   relate to the   52  -week fiscal year ended   August 31, 2014  . References to   2013   and   2012   relate to the   52  -week and   53  -week fiscal years ended   September 1, 2013   and   September 2, 2012  , respectively. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company s previously reported consolidated financial statements. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to one week. Credit and debit card receivables were $  1,383   and $  1,254   at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Short-Term Investments 
  In general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments

  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. 
  The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the credit loss component in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. The majority of the Company s investments are in debt securities. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: 
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
  The Company s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information using  consensus pricing.  The "consensus pricing" approach uses market prices from a variety of industry-standard independent data providers or pricing that considers various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. 
  The Company s current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. The Company s long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums. 
  Receivables, Net 
  Receivables consist of the following at the end of   2014   and   2013  : 

Vendor receivables include payments from vendors in the form of volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (Continued) 
  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. The balance primarily represents amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements, and are reflected on a gross basis, separate from the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented on a gross basis within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members  insurance companies for the amount above their co-pay, which is collected at the point-of-sale. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, of which the majority are tax-related items.  
  Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  . 
  Merchandise Inventories 
  Merchandise inventories consist of the following at the end of   2014   and   2013  : 

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation rates and inventory levels for the year have been determined. 
  Due to overall net inflationary trends in   2014   and   2012  , charges of $  28   and $  21   were recorded to merchandise costs, respectively, to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories. Due to overall net deflationary trends in 2013, a benefit of $  27   was recorded to merchandise costs. At the end of   2014   and   2013  , the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories was $  109   and $  81  , respectively. 
  The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on the Company s experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with its own estimated useful life, generally   five   to   fifty   years for buildings and improvements and   three   to   twenty   years for equipment and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are made. 
  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Assets that were removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held for sale at the end of   2014   and   2013   were immaterial. 
  The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (Continued) 
  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held for sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges, included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012   were immaterial. 
  The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. These costs are included in equipment and fixtures, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally   three   to   seven   years. 
  Other Assets 
  Other assets consist of the following at the end of   2014   and   2013  : 

Receivables from governmental entities largely consists of various tax-related items including amounts deposited with taxing authorities in connection with ongoing income tax audits. The Company adjusts the carrying value of its employee life insurance contracts to the net cash surrender value at the end of each reporting period. Other assets primarily consists of non-current deferred tax assets and goodwill resulting from certain business combinations. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. No impairment of goodwill has been incurred to date. 
  Accounts Payable 
  The Company s banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of   2014   and   2013   are $  588   and $  493  , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn. 
  Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities 
  The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers  compensation, general liability, property damage, directors  and officers  liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. As of the end of   2014   and   2013  , these insurance liabilities were $  815   and $  727   in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accounts payable, accrued salaries and benefits, and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature. 
  The Company s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit any participating members  individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreement.

Other Current Liabilities 
  Other current liabilities consist of the following at the end of   2014   and   2013  : 

Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company s international subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $  585   and $  458   at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively. While the Company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship, there can be no assurance that this practice is effective. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of   2014   and   2013  . 
  The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  . 
  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the  normal purchases or normal sales  exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment. 
  Foreign Currency 
  The functional currencies of the Company s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Revenues and expenses of the Company s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. 
  The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. Generally, this includes the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts.

Revenue Recognition 
  The Company generally recognizes sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payments from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amounts received are generally recorded as deferred sales, included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or service is completed. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. 
  The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts earned, which is reflected in net sales. 
  The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The Company's Executive members qualify for a   2%   reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $  750   per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets) are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $  1,051  , $  970  , and $  900   in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. 
  Merchandise Costs 
  Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company s depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, utilities, and depreciation on production equipment in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. 
  Vendor Consideration 
  The Company has agreements with vendors to receive funds for volume rebates, certain promotional activities, and other vendor consideration. Volume rebates or other purchase discounts are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers  compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, bank charges, utilities, and stock-based compensation expense as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations. 
  Retirement Plans 
  The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan available to all U.S. employees who have completed   90 days   of employment. The plan allows pre-tax deferrals, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of each employee's salary. Certain Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were   $436  ,   $409  , and   $382   for   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively, and included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation 
  Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years, all grants allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The Company does not reduce stock-based compensation for an estimate of forfeitures because the estimate is inconsequential in light of historical experience and considering the awards vest on a quarterly basis. The impact of actual forfeitures arising in the event of termination is recognized as actual forfeitures occur.  
  Compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. The terms of the Company s stock-based awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting of a portion of outstanding shares based on reaching certain cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.  
  Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company s stock-based compensation plans. 
  Leases 
  The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities, primarily under operating leases. Operating leases expire at various dates through   2062  , with the exception of one lease in the Company s United Kingdom subsidiary, which expires in   2151  . These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer. 
  The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any exercised extension options, from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. 
  The Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through   2040  . Capital lease assets are included in buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded as depreciation expense and is predominately included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capital lease liabilities are recorded at the lesser of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included in other current liabilities and deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.  
  The Company s asset retirement obligations (ARO) are primarily related to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed in order to comply with the lease agreement. These obligations are recorded as a liability with an offsetting  asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair market value of the costs to remove the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation using the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the respective leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases amounted to $  55   and $  50   at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively, and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  Preopening Expenses 
  Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.

Interest Income and Other, Net 
  Interest income and other, net includes: 

Income Taxes 
  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. 
  The determination of the Company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. See Note 8 for additional information. 
  Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco 
  The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise and vesting to the participant of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to stock options and RSUs and the  if converted  method for the convertible note securities. 
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par is deducted by allocation to both additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is calculated as the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased.  Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Disclosure is required of the net income line items impacted by significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the item is reclassified in its entirety. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, cross-references to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP are required. The new guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of 2014 and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting discontinued operations, as well as requiring new disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The Company will adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The issued guidance converges the criteria for reporting revenue, as well as requiring disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from these contracts. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    Note 2 Investments 
  The Company s investments at the end of   2014   and   2013   were as follows: 

Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  . At the end of   2014   and   2012  , the Company's available-for-sale securities that were in a continuous unrealized-loss position were not material, and at the end of   2013  , the Company had none. There were no gross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents at the end of   2014   and   2013  , and these amounts were not material at the end of   2012  .

   Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include held-to-maturity investments that are carried at amortized cost and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial assets during   2014   and   2013  . See Note 4 for discussion on the fair value of long-term debt. 
  Nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as long-lived assets that are measured at fair value resulting from an impairment, if deemed necessary. Fair value adjustments to these nonfinancial assets and liabilities during   2014   and   2013   were immaterial. 
    Note 4 Debt 
  Short-Term Borrowings 
  The Company enters into various short-term bank credit facilities, totaling   $451   and   $700   in   2014   and   2013  , respectively. At the end of   2014  , there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities and   $36   outstanding at the end of   2013  , with interest rates ranging from   0.10%   to   4.31%  . 
  The weighted average borrowings, maximum borrowings, and weighted average interest rate under all short-term borrowing arrangements, were as follows for   2014   and   2013  : 

Long-Term Debt 
  In December 2012, the Company issued   $3,500   in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (December 2012 Notes collectively) as follows:   $1,200   of   0.65%   Senior Notes due   December 7, 2015   (0.65% Notes);   $1,100   of   1.125%   Senior Notes due   December 15, 2017   (1.125% Notes); and   $1,200   of   1.7%   Senior Notes due   December 15, 2019   (1.7% Notes). Interest is payable semi-annually. The Company, at its option, may redeem the December 2012 Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount of the December 2012 Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the December 2012 Notes at a price of   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the December 2012 Notes. The discount and issuance costs associated with the December 2012 Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the notes. The December 2012 Notes are classified as a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 
  In February 2007, the Company issued   $1,100   of   5.5%   Senior Notes due   March 15, 2017   at a discount of   $6   (the 2007 Senior Note). Interest is payable semi-annually. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Note are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the note. The Company, at its option, may redeem the 2007 Senior Note at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Note to be redeemed or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior

   Note at a price of   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Note. This note is classified as a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Other long-term debt consisted primarily of promissory notes and term loans issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary.  These notes and term loans are classified primarily as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. In July 2014, the Company's Japanese subsidiary also issued approximately   $117   of   0.92%   Yen-denominated guaranteed Senior Notes through a private placement. Interest on these Senior Notes is payable semi-annually and principal is due   July 8, 2024  . This debt is classified as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The estimated fair value of the Company's debt was based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit. The carrying value and estimated fair value at the end of 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:

Beginning in 2009, RSU grants to all executive officers have been performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. RSUs held by employees and non-employee directors are subject to quarterly or daily vesting, respectively, upon certain terminations of employment or service.

  Note 7 Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) 

   Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date rather than upon qualified retirement. The Sixth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Sixth Plan), amended in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, is the Company s only stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of   2014  . Each share issued in respect of stock awards is counted as   1.75   shares toward the limit of shares made available under the Sixth Plan. The Sixth Plan authorized the issuance of   16,000,000   shares (  9,143,000   RSUs) of common stock for future grants. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares equal to minimum statutory withholding taxes. 
  In conjunction with the special cash dividend discussed in Note 6, adjustments were made to awards outstanding on the dividend record date to preserve their value following the dividend, as follows: (i) the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased; and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding stock options were reduced and the number of shares subject to such options was increased. Approximately   2,905,000   stock options were adjusted by   221,000   shares, and approximately   9,676,000   RSUs were adjusted by   732,000   shares. These adjustments did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding awards did not change. As further required by the Sixth Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the Sixth Plan was also proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional   1,362,000   shares (  778,000   RSUs) available to be granted. 
  Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity 
  RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over   five   years and   three   years, respectively; however, the terms of the RSUs provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained   25   or more years and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively, and provides for vesting upon certain terminations of employment or service. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and undelivered shares. At the end of   2014  ,   7,972,000   shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the Sixth Plan. 
  The following awards were outstanding at the end of   2014  : 
             
    8,505,000   time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; 
                
    612,000   performance-based RSUs, of which   269,000   were granted to executive officers subject to the certification of the attainment of specified performance targets for   2014  . This certification occurred in September 2014, at which time a portion vested as a result of the long service of all executive officers. The awards are subject to future time-based and long-service vesting. 
     The following table summarizes RSU transactions during   2014  : 

The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of   2014   was $  548   and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is   1.7   years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of   2014   were approximately   2,811,000   RSUs vested but not yet delivered.

  Note 8 Income Taxes (Continued) 

   The provisions for income taxes for   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012   are as follows: 

Tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs were allocated to equity attributable to Costco in the amount of $  84  , $  59  , and $  65  , in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. 
  The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012   is as follows: 

The Company s provision for income taxes for   2013   was favorably impacted by a   $62   nonrecurring tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend of   $7.00   per share paid by the Company to employees, who through the Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan owned   22,600,000   shares of Company stock through an ESOP. Dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 
  The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 

The deferred tax accounts at the end of   2014   and   2013   include current deferred income tax assets of $  448   and $  422   respectively, included in deferred income taxes and other current assets; non-current deferred income tax assets of $  68   and $  62  , respectively, included in other assets; and non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $  429   and $  450  , respectively, included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities.

  Note 8 Income Taxes (Continued) 

   In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company changed its position regarding the undistributed earnings of the Canadian operations, and a portion of the earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. Current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial U.S. tax liability, which was recorded at the end of 2014. Canadian withholding taxes, which are creditable against federal income taxes, have also been accrued on the amount expected to be repatriated. 
  The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $  3,619   at the end of   2014  , of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested. This includes the remaining undistributed earnings of the Canadian operations that the Company continues to assert are indefinitely reinvested. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company believes that its U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet its U.S. liquidity requirements and has no current plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for   2014   and   2013   is as follows: 

Included in the balance at the end of   2014  , are $  38   of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. 
  The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $  47   and $  46   at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized by the Company were not material in   2014   and   2013  . Accrued interest and penalties were not material at the end of   2014   and   2013  . 
  The Company is currently under audit by several taxing jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits we have recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
  The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2007. The Company is currently subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2010 to present and in California for fiscal years 2007 to present. No other examinations are believed to be material.

Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this report, the Company has recorded an accrual with respect to one matter described below, which is not material to the Company's financial statements. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot in our view be reasonably estimated because, among other things, (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified, (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed, and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. 
  The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others: 
  A case brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California state law. Shirley  Rae  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, interest and attorneys  fees. Class certification was granted by the district court on January 11, 2007. On September 16, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the order of class certification and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. On September 25, 2012, the district court certified a class of women in the United States denied promotion to warehouse general manager or assistant general manager since January 3, 2002. This class is less than   1,300   people. In February 2014 the court granted preliminary approval of a proposed settlement. Any payments to class members under the proposed settlement would be contingent upon proof of liability in individual adjudications. The court granted final approval on May 27, 2014. Payments made and expected to be made under the settlement would be immaterial to the Company s operations or financial position. 
  Numerous putative class actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that they have been overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than   60   degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensate for heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the consumer. The Company is named in the following actions: Raphael Sagalyn, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-430 (D. Md.); Phyllis Lerner, et al., v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, et al., Case No. 07-1216 (C.D. Cal.); Linda A. Williams, et al., v. BP Corporation North America, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-179 (M.D. Ala.); James Graham, et al. v.

America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.). On June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation, MDL Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant. Under the settlement, which was subject to final approval by the court, the Company agreed, to the extent allowed by law and subject to other terms and conditions in the agreement, to install over five years from the effective date of the settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Other than payments to class representatives, the settlement does not provide for cash payments to class members. On September 22, 2011, the court preliminarily approved a revised settlement, which did not materially alter the terms. On April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffs have moved for an award of   $10 million   in attorneys  fees, as well as an award of costs and payments to class representatives. The Company has opposed the motion. On March 20, 2014, the Company filed a notice invoking a  most favored nation  provision under the settlement, under which it seeks to adopt provisions in later settlements with certain other defendants, an invocation that class counsel has opposed. 
  On October 4, 2006, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney s Office for the Central District of California, seeking records relating to the Company s receipt and handling of hazardous merchandise returned by Costco members and other records. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney s Office. 
  The Environmental Protection Agency issued an Information Request to the Company, dated November 1, 2007, regarding warehouses in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada and relating to compliance with regulations concerning air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment.  On September 3, 2014, the EPA and the Department of Justice announced a settlement with the Company under which, among other things, the Company agreed to pay an immaterial sum and to implement steps to reduce the use and releases of ozone-depleting gas in certain of its refrigeration systems.  The settlement is subject to federal court approval. 
  The Company has received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. 
  The Company has received from the Drug Enforcement Administration subpoenas and administrative inspection warrants concerning the Company's fulfillment of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. The Company is seeking to cooperate with these processes. 
  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter.

   Note 11 Segment Reporting 
  The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Australia, and Spain and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. The Company s reportable segments are largely based on management s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1. All material inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International Operations, but are included in the U.S. Operations because those costs are not allocated internally and generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.

   COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION  
  SIXTH RESTATED 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
           1. 
    Grant of Stock Units       
       
  You are hereby granted Employee Stock Units covering the number of shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. common stock (the  Shares ) specified in the Grant Detail made available electronically in connection with the grant (the  Detail ).  By accepting this grant, the Employee acknowledges and agrees that this grant is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Costco Wholesale Corporation Sixth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which is incorporated here by reference and a copy of which can be found on the Company's internal website or obtained through the Financial Planning Department.    
           2. 
    Vesting Schedule and Delivery of Shares    
       
  (a) The Stock Units are not Shares; they will be converted into shares when the Stock Units are settled subsequent to vesting. Generally, your Stock Units will settle and be issued as Shares on the schedule set forth in the Detail. You will receive the Shares within 10 business days of the anniversary of the grant date.  Fractional shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. A portion of your Shares will be withheld to cover taxes.  
  (b) Active employees who attain 25 or more years of service shall qualify for accelerated vesting:  one-third of the then unvested Stock Units for 25 or more years of service; two-thirds of the newly granted Stock Units for 30 or more years of service or one-half of the then unvested Stock Units for those grants which have already received the accelerated vesting related to the 25 years of service; and all of the newly granted or then unvested Stock Units for 35 or more years of service.  Following this accelerated vesting, unvested Stock Units shall vest on a pro rata basis over the remaining term of the grant at the dates set forth in the Detail  
    
  For example, if you receive on October 22 a grant of 6,000 Stock Units with a five-year vesting schedule and attain 25 years of service on the following April 15, at the next October 22 you will vest as to 1,200 Stock Units for the normal annual vesting (one-fifth times 6,000) and as to an additional 1,600 Stock Units due to years of service (6,000 minus 1,200 times one-third).    
  If you received the same grant of 6,000 Stock Units with a five-year vesting schedule and had attained 25 years of service prior to the October 22 grant date, you would receive 2,000 Stock Units (6,000 times one-third) on the date of grant. If on the following April 15, you attained 30 years of service, then on the following October 22, you would receive 800 Stock Units for the normal annual vesting (6,000 minus 2,000 times one-fifth), and an additional 1,600 Stock Units due to years of service (6,000 minus 2,800 times one-half).  For those first receiving grants in or after October 2013, long-service periods required for accelerated vesting require continuous years of service. 
  (c) If your employment is terminated other than for cause, you will vest in additional stock units as set forth below. For purposes of this subparagraph (c), the quarterly dates are: January 22; April 22; and July 22.  
  i. Except in the case of years when a new accelerated vesting threshold (25, 30, or 35 years of service) is or would be reached, for each complete quarter that has passed since the anniversary of the grant date you will vest in 25% of the Stock Units that were scheduled to vest that grant year. For example, if you receive a grant on October 22 of 6,000 Stock Units with a five-year vesting schedule and you terminate on the next April 23 (two quarters later) you will vest as to 600 Stock Units (one-fifth times 6,000 times two-fourths). You will receive shares within 90 days of termination.  
  ii. If you terminate after the grant date (other than a termination for cause) and have by the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarterly vesting date attained the required years of service, you will receive the Pro Rata Number of Shares that have vested under the normal annual vesting and the Shares that you have qualified for based on accelerated vesting within 90 days of your termination.  For example, if under the example above, you  
    1 

had received a grant of 6,000 Stock Units and had already attained 25 years of service prior to the date of grant, attained 30 years of service on the following April 15, and Terminated (other than for cause) on August 30, you would receive 600 Stock Units as a result of your Pro Rata Number of shares from normal annual vesting (6,000 minus 2,000 times one-fifth times three-fourths), and an additional 1,700 Stock units due to years of service (6,000 minus 2,600 times one-half).  
  iii. If you terminate before the end of the first quarterly date (January 22), you will not vest in any otherwise unvested shares. For example, if you receive a grant on October 22 of 6,000 Stock Units with a five-year vesting schedule and you attain 25-years of service on December 1, and you terminate on December 2, you would not receive any Stock Units from that award.    
  (d) Accelerated vesting also will occur at death.  That vesting will be 100% if you were an officer at the Assistant Vice President level or above or if you have ten or more years of service.  Otherwise, that vesting will be 50% (after giving credit for the quarterly vesting applied for terminations).  Shares will be distributed within 90 days of death.  
  (e) No further vesting (including without limitation any accelerated vesting) shall occur if you are terminated for cause. Vesting shall continue during a leave of absence; provided, however, that the Administrator has the discretion to cancel Stock Units or forfeit vesting in connection with a leave of absence.   
  (f) If you voluntarily or involuntarily experience a change to employment status or to a position in the Company that is not eligible for a Stock Unit Grant or is eligible for a lesser number of Stock Units, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, vesting shall cease at the time of such change or occur at the lesser number associated with the new position; in connection with the change in status or position, at the anniversary of the grant you will vest at your prior position award level based on the number of full quarters of service since the prior grant date anniversary achieved at that position prior to the change in status.  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:  to the extent that the Company in good faith determines that any action provided for under section 2 constitutes a  deferral of compensation  and that the Employee is a "specified employee" (in each case as such terms are defined under Internal Revenue Code section 409A), no amounts shall be paid and no delivery of Shares shall be made to the Employee prior to the earliest of (a) the Employee s death following the date of Termination, or (b) six months after the date of the Employee s Termination with the Company. Issuance of Shares with respect to the Stock Unit will be made at a time and/or upon the occurrence of events that comply with Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, on a Change In Control event that is defined in section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) and shall include, where required in the case of specified employees, the six-month delay in section 409A(a)(2)(B). 
    
           4. 
    No Shareholder Rights    
       
  Stock Units represent hypothetical shares of Stock.  Until the Stock Units vest and Shares are issued, you shall not be entitled to any of the rights or benefits generally accorded to shareholders. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, delivery of Shares must be effected by book-entry credit to a custody account (the "Custody Account") maintained by you with a Custodian designated by the Company.  You shall be the beneficial owner of any Shares properly credited to the Custody Account.  You shall have no right to any dividend or distribution or vote or other shareholder rights with respect to such Shares if the record date is prior to the date the Custody Account is properly credited with the Shares.  

(a) For tax and withholding purposes, the value of any Shares issued shall be determined based on the closing stock price on the date of vesting, regardless of when the Shares are actually credited to a Custody Account. You shall be liable for any and all taxes, including (without limitation) withholding taxes, interest or penalties arising  
    2 

out of this grant, the vesting of Stock Units, any violation of Code section 409A that impacts this Stock Unit, or the transfer of Shares or other property in settlement of the Stock Units.  In the event that the Company or the Employer (as defined below) is required to withhold taxes as a result of the grant or vesting of Stock Units, the transfer of Shares or other property in settlement of the Stock Units, or any subsequent sale of Shares issued in settlement of such Stock Units, you shall surrender a sufficient number of whole Shares as necessary to cover all required withholding taxes and required social security contributions at the time the restrictions on the Stock Units lapse. To the extent that any surrender of Shares for payment is insufficient, you authorize the Company and its Affiliates, which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct all applicable required withholding taxes and social security contributions from your compensation.  You agree to pay any amounts that cannot be satisfied from wages or other cash compensation, to the extent permitted by law.   
  (b) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employee's employer (the "Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security, payroll tax, payment on account, other tax-related withholding or information reporting ("Tax-Related Items"), the Employee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by Employee is and remains the Employee's responsibility and that the Company and the Employer:  (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this grant of Stock Units, including the vesting of Stock Units, subsequent payment of Shares related to such Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such Stock Units; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms or any aspect of this grant of Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability for Tax-Related Items.  The Company may refuse to deliver Shares if the Employee fails to comply with the Employee's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.   
    
           6. 
    Data Privacy Consent 
     The Employee consents, to the extent applicable law requires consent, to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Employee's personal data by and among, as applicable, the Company and its Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of administering the Employee's participation in the Plan.  The Employee understands that the Company, the Employer and their Affiliates hold certain personal information about the Employee, including name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security or insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company or by the Employer, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Employee's favor for the purpose of administering the Plan ("Data").  The Employee understands that the Data may be transferred to third parties assisting in the administration of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in the Employee's country or elsewhere and that the recipient country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Employee's country.  The Employee understands that he may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data, request information as to the nature of the Data provided to other parties, and withdraw the consent contained in this section, all by contacting the Financial Planning Department, and understands that refusing or withdrawing consent may affect his ability to participate in the Plan.  
    
           7. 
    Plan Information 
       
  The Employee acknowledges receipt of copies of the Plan and the Plan prospectus from the Company and agrees to receive shareholder information, including copies of any annual report, proxy statement and periodic report, from the investor relations section of the Company's website at http://www.costco.com. The Employee acknowledges that copies of the Plan, Plan prospectus, Plan information and shareholder information are also available upon written or telephonic request to the Financial Planning Department, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA  98027.

8. 
    Acknowledgment and Waiver 
       
  Employee agrees that:  
    
  (a) the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time unless otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement; and that the grant of Stock Units is discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Awards or other benefits in lieu of Awards, even if Awards have been granted repeatedly in the past;   
    
  (b) the Employee's participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further employment with the Company, does not create an employment contract with the Company, and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company to terminate the Employee's employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and it is expressly agreed and understood that employment is terminable at the will of either party, insofar as permitted by law;  
    
  (c) the Stock Units and resulting benefits are an extraordinary item that is outside the scope of the Employee's employment contract, if any, and are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments insofar as permitted by law;   
    
  (d) the future value of the Shares is unknown, may increase or decrease from the date of grant or vesting of the Stock Unit and cannot be predicted with certainty.  No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of this grant of Stock Units or diminution in value of this grant of Stock Units resulting from changes in the value of the Company s stock or the Employee's Termination by the Company (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Employee irrevocably releases the Company from, and agrees not to pursue against the Company, any such claim that may arise; and  
    
  (e) upon the Employee s Termination (whether or not such Termination constitutes a breach of local labor laws), the Employee's right to receive benefits shall be only as set forth in this Agreement; his Termination shall be effective at the date reasonably anticipated by the Company and the Employee that the Employee will no longer be employed at a level equal to or greater than 21% percent of his average level of services over the immediately preceding thirty-six month period.  Employee s Termination will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law); and the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Employee is no longer actively employed for purposes of this grant of Stock Units.   
    
           9. 
    Miscellaneous    
     (a) The Company shall not be required to treat as the owner of Stock Units, and associated benefits hereunder, any transferee to whom such Stock Units or benefits shall have been so transferred in violation of this Agreement.   
  (b) The parties agree to execute such further instruments and to take such action as may reasonably be necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.   
  (c) Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon delivery to the Employee at the Employee's address then on file with the Company.   
  (d) The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and the Employee with respect to that subject matter and may not be modified adversely to the Employee's interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and the Employee.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington.  In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the Plan terms and provisions shall govern (subject to section 9(e)).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.  Certain other important terms governing this contract are contained in the Plan.  If issues of interpretation arise under this Agreement, the judgment of the Administrator  
    4 

shall be final.  
  (e) To the extent the Company determines that this Agreement is subject to section 409A, but does not conform with the requirements thereof, the Company may at its sole discretion amend or replace the Agreement to cause the Agreement to comply with section 409A.    
  (f) The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION  
  SIXTH RESTATED 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT   
    
  NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR   
           1. 
    Grant of Stock Units    
       
  You are hereby granted Non-executive Director Stock Units covering the number of shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. common stock (the  Shares ) specified in the Grant Detail made available electronically in connection with the grant (the  Detail ). This grant is subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Costco Wholesale Corporation Sixth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), a copy of which can be obtained through the Financial Planning Department.  
           2. 
    Vesting Schedule and Delivery of Shares    
       
  (a) The Stock Units are not Shares; they will be converted into Shares when the Stock Units vest. Generally, your Stock Units will vest into Shares on the schedule set forth in the Notice, and you will receive the Shares within ten business days of the vest date. Fractional shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.   
  (b) Directors who terminate from service will receive daily vesting of Stock Units. For each day that has passed since the anniversary of your grant date you will vest in 1/365th of the Stock Units that were scheduled to vest that grant year. For example, if you receive a grant on October 22 of 3,000 Stock Units with a three-year vesting schedule and you terminate on the next April 23 (182 days later), you will vest as to 500 Stock Units (one-third times 3,000 times 50%). You will receive shares within 90 days of termination.   
  (c) Directors who terminate from service after five or more years of service on the Board of Directors shall qualify for accelerated vesting on termination. Should you terminate after five years of service on the Board of Directors, 50% of the Stock Units that would otherwise be unvested at your termination date shall vest on termination. Should you terminate after ten years of service on the Board of Directors, 100% of the Stock Units that would otherwise be unvested at your termination date shall vest on termination. You will receive shares within 90 days of termination.  
  (d) Accelerated vesting also will occur at death. In the event of your death, you will vest in 100% of the otherwise unvested Stock Units. Shares will be distributed within 90 days of death.  
    
           3. 
    No Shareholder Rights 
       
  Stock Units represent hypothetical shares of Stock. Until the Stock Units vest, you shall not be entitled to any of the rights or benefits generally accorded to shareholders. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, delivery of Shares shall be effected by book-entry credit to a custody account (the "Custody Account") maintained by you with a Custodian designated by the Company. No delivery of Shares shall be made unless a Custody Account has been established for you. You shall be the beneficial owner of any Shares properly credited to the Custody Account. You shall have no right to any dividend or distribution or vote or other shareholder rights with respect to such Shares if the record date for such event is prior to the date the Custody Account is properly credited with such Shares.   

(a) For tax reporting and withholding purposes, the value of any Shares issued shall be determined based on the closing stock price on the date of vesting regardless of when the Shares are actually credited to a Custody Account. The Director shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, interest or penalties arising out of  
    1 

this grant, the vesting of Stock Units hereunder, or the transfer of Shares or other property in settlement of the Stock Units. In the event that the Company is required to withhold taxes as a result of the grant or vesting of Stock Units, the transfer of Shares or other property in settlement of the Stock Units, or any subsequent sale of Shares issued in settlement of such Stock Units, the Director shall surrender a sufficient number of whole Shares as necessary to cover all required withholding taxes and required social security contributions at the time the restrictions on the Stock Units lapse, unless alternative procedures for payment are established prior to the applicable vesting date by the Company. The Company has no obligation to provide for alternative procedures. To the extent that any surrender of Shares or payment of cash or alternative procedure for such payment is insufficient, the Director authorizes the Company and its Affiliates, which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct all applicable required withholding taxes and social security contributions from the Director s compensation unless the Director has made other arrangements to pay cash for such excess withholding obligation. The Director agrees to pay any amounts that cannot be satisfied from other cash compensation, to the extent permitted by law.  
    
  (b) Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security, payroll tax, payment on account, other tax-related withholding or information reporting ("Tax-Related Items"), the Director acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Director s responsibility and that the Company: (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this grant of Stock Units, including the vesting of Stock Units, subsequent payment of Shares and/or cash related to such Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to such Stock Units; and (ii) does not commit to structure the terms or any aspect of this grant of Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Director s liability for Tax-Related Items. The Director shall pay the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold as a result of the Director s participation in the Plan or the Director s receipt of Stock Units that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver Shares if the Director fails to comply with the Director s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.   
    
           5. 
    Data Privacy Consent
