WAL-MART STORES, INC. 
  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 
  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31,   2015    
  PART I 
                   ITEM 1. 
    BUSINESS 

General 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping.  Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate.  Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.  Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. 
  Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity.  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. 
  Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  "),   January 31, 2014   ("fiscal   2014  ") and   January 31, 2013   ("fiscal   2013  ").  During fiscal   2015  , we generated total revenues of $  485.7 billion  , which was primarily comprised of net sales of   $482.2 billion  . 
  We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT." 
  The Development of Our Company 
  Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1983, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. 
  In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and as of   January 31, 2015  , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. 
  In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website.  Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow and as of   January 31, 2015  , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.

The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 
  Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately   60%   of our net sales in fiscal   2015  , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. 
  Walmart International consists of operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other.  These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash   carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  Walmart International generated approximately   28%   of our fiscal   2015   net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. 
  Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately   12%   of our fiscal   2015   net sales.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. 
  The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. 
    Walmart U.S. Segment 
  The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as walmart.com.

Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country.  Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click   Collect" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico. 
  Merchandise.   The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hometrends," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent s Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," "Extra Special" and "Smart Price."  In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. 
  Operations.   The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  Each country accepts a variety of payment methods.  
  Seasonal Aspects of Operations.   The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. 
  Competition.   The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate.  We also operate some restaurants and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations.  We compete with others for desirable sites.  Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates.  We believe EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. 
  Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. 
  Global and Domestic Economic Risks and Consumer Demand Risks 
  General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.  Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory.  Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S.  These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results. 
  Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results.  The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. 
  We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or a combination of both retail offerings, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. 
  It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand.  The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings.  A critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience and convenience. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings.  Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or a combination of these retail offerings, could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. 
  Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.  
  Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.  Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period.  As a result of such translations, future fluctuations in currency exchange rate over time that are unfavorable to us may result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance.  Such unfavorable currency exchange rate  
     20 

fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse affect on our reported consolidated results of operations. 
  We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.  When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of goods sold may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Capital Investment and Information Systems Risks 
    
  We may face impediments to our expansion in the U.S., including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations.  Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states.  Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters.  If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected.  In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 
  Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations.  In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets.  As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units.  In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.  Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve.  If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 
  We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified.  Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time.  Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. 
  We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. 
  Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.  Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates.  If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant  
     21 

investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim.  Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations.  In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business.  The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk.  If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. 
  Competitive and Reputational Risks 
  Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations.  If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.  The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015 will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly.  If the combined impact of the increase in our gross profit and decrease in certain operating expenses in fiscal 2015 and thereafter does not offset the additional wage expense, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for recent fiscal years.  In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 
  We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through a combination of both areas), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The retail business is highly competitive.  Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers, as well as other national and international internet-based retailers.  Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.  Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations.  Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale.  Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance.  See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments. 
  Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace.  Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
     22 

If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. 
  Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.  Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping.  We are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer "Walmart Pickup" and "Club Pickup" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.  Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
  Data and Privacy Risks 
  Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates, vendors and others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results.  
  As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors.  We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions.  In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.  Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems.  We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us.  
  As a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures, we believe that past attempts by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful.  However, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers information systems.  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.  Moreover, associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers  security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers information systems (whether digital or otherwise).   
  Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
  In addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies.  Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. 
     23 

As a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.  PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data.  By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines.  Even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future.  To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.  In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. 
  Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks 
  Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance.  All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct.  Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.  Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.  In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.  These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish.  As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Legal, Regulatory and Other External Risks 
  Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance. 
  We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America, China and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in China.  During fiscal   2015  , our Walmart International operations generated approximately   28%   of our consolidated net sales.  As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years.  Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. 
  In particular, Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil.  These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Other  
     24 

factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. 
  In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the UK Bribery Act.  We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.  Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance. 
  Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.  These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses.  Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages.  Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation.  Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  We are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.  In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 4,000 "equal value" claims that are pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom.  The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.  The claimants are seeking:  (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in the store rate prospectively, to match that paid in the warehouses and the  
     25 

distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation.  At this time, it is undetermined:  (i) how many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of "test cases."  Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues.  Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, or who have performed, like work in that position.  On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims.  On March 23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules.  We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements", which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.  
  The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de M xico, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct.  We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs.  Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.  Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India.  In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA.  A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.  Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. 
  We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters.  One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties.  The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  We cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review.  Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (incremental to the $173 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2015) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers.  These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business.  We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences.  Our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues.  While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.  Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.

    PROPERTIES 

The number of supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats and Sam's Clubs located in each state or territory of the U.S. and the number of units located in each of the geographic markets internationally in which we operate are disclosed as of the fiscal year ended January 31,   2015   in the part of our Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption "Unit Counts as of January 31,   2015  " that is an exhibit hereto and that information is incorporated herein by reference.  The following table provides further details of our retail units and distribution facilities, including return facilities, as of   January 31, 2015  :      

  We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our principal office and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. for operations and field management.  The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company.  We use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume.  Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents. 
  For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under "Item 1. Business."

ITEM 3. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:   We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies," which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference in this item.  We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought.  We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.   
  Wage-and-Hour Class Action:    Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart  , Ct. of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, PA, 3/20/02 and 8/30/04; Superior Ct. of PA, Eastern Dist., Philadelphia, PA, 12/7/07; Supreme Ct. of PA, Harrisburg, PA, 10/9/11. 
  ASDA Equal Value Claims:    Ms S Brierley   Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008   Others-Manchester Employment Tribunal). 
  II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS:   The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in   The New York Times (  the "  Times  "  )   on April 21, 2012.  One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company.  The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock.  In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the   Times   story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants.  The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of FCPA compliance.  All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  On March 31, 2015, the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants  motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court.  Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:   Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters.  The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.  For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
  Between April 2014 and October 2014, the Sustainability Development Ministry of the Municipality of Juarez in Nuevo Le n, Mexico, notified a subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., that there were environmental concerns with the operations at 10 stores.  These concerns included but were not limited to the failure to have the appropriate number of trees planted on the property, failure to have appropriate perimeter fencing, and lack of proper zoning permits for some stores.  The Company resolved this with the agency by paying a penalty of approximately $333,000 and implementing steps to address the concerns. 
  In 2014, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico, notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V., that four stores may have been constructed without first obtaining an environmental impact license as required, and for failing to comply with conditions required by those licenses.  The Ministry has proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000 and has required the Company to obtain the licenses and comply with the conditions. 
  In September 2014, a spill of approximately 50 liters of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico.  A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., took steps to address the spill and engaged an expert to oversee the final cleanup.  The Municipality of Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately $128,000 along with implementation of a monitoring program around the spill area to address the situation. 
  In February 2014, a division of the Health Department of the City of Vit ria notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil"), a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak had been observed in the parking lot of a store. Walmart Brazil immediately took steps to address the situation and is cooperating with the agency to resolve the issue. 
  In January 2014, a division of the State Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the proper license for a wastewater treatment system.  Walmart Brazil is working with the agency to resolve the issue. 
  In August 2013, the Company received a notice from the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") alleging that two products sold by the Company have exceeded volatile organic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations.  The Company is responding to the allegations and cooperating with CARB's investigation. 
  In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compa ias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank.  The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria T cnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. 
  In July 2011, the Environmental Department of Bento Gon alves notified Walmart Brazil that it is investigating alleged soil contamination from oil leakage.  Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency and monitoring the affected area.  
  In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil.  Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.

    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Certain information required to be provided in this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information included under the captions "Market price of common stock," "Listing" and "Dividends paid per share" in our Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to Shareholders that is in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein. 
  Our common stock is primarily traded in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange.  At   March 30, 2015  , the latest practicable date, there were   249,876   common stock shareholders of record. 
  From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.  On June 6, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous   $15.0 billion   share repurchase program, which had approximately   $712 million   of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new   $15.0 billion   share repurchase program, announced on June 7, 2013.  As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  At   January 31, 2015  , authorization for   $10.3 billion   of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.   
  For the three months ended   January 31, 2015  , the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. 
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. 
  Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

               (A) 
    the expiry of the Option Period, 
              (B) 
    save where Rule 7.1 (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) or (G) or Rules 7.3, 7.4 or 7.8 applies, the Option Holder ceasing to be an Employee, 
              (C) 
    where an Option becomes exercisable by virtue of Rule 7.1 (B), (C), (D), (E) or (G), 6 months after the date on which the Option became so exercisable,

    For Options granted before 6 April 2014, the list of events in Rule 7.1 shall be read as including "the death of the Option Holder", the list of events in Rule 7.2 shall be read as including "the first anniversary of the date of the Option Holder's death or, where the death occurred during the Option Period, the first anniversary of the relevant Bonus Date" and Rule 7.2(A) shall be read as being subject to this. 
              7.5 
    For Options granted before 17/7/13, if before the relevant Bonus Date the Option Holder reaches age 60 but continues to be employed by the Group, the Option may be exercised within the period of 6 months after such event.  Thereafter, to the extent unexercised, the Option may only be exercised after the earliest of the events set out in Rule 7.1. 

7.6 
    An Option Holder who decides not to exercise an Option in accordance with these Rules may withdraw the aggregate amount accumulated under the relevant SAYE Contract. 
              7.7 
    For the purpose of the Rules, an Option Holder shall not be treated as ceasing to be an Employee of a Participating Company until he ceases to hold any office or employment with the Company or any associated company (as that term is defined in paragraph 35(4) of Schedule 3).   
              7.8 
    If at the Bonus Date an Option Holder holds an office or employment in a company which is not a Participating Company but which is an Associated Company of the Company then his Option may be exercised within six months of the Bonus Date. 
              7.9 
    An Option Holder may only exercise any Option to the extent that the aggregate Option Price paid for the Shares on such exercise will not exceed the aggregate amount (including any interest and/or the relevant bonus) of his savings under the SAYE Contract at the relevant date. 
              7.10 
    No Option may be exercised by an Option Holder if the Option Holder is (or immediately before his death was) excluded from participation in the Sharesave Plan by virtue of paragraph 10 of Schedule 3. 
              7.11 
    An Option shall lapse in the event that the Option Holder - 
              (A) 
    ceases to make monthly savings contributions under the relevant SAYE Contract or under the terms of the SAYE Contract is deemed to have given notice of his intention to cease to make monthly savings contributions under the relevant SAYE Contract, or 
              (B) 
    unless in connection with the exercise of an Option under this Sharesave Plan, requests repayment of his monthly savings contributions from the relevant SAYE Contract from the Appropriate Authority. 
              8. 
    Take-overs or a disposal of the Company 
              8.1 
    Subject to the Option not having lapsed under Rule 7.2, the Option may be exercised during the period of 6 calendar months following 
              (i) 
    the acquisition of Control of Wal-Mart by a person pursuant to a general offer 
              (a) 
    to acquire the whole of the issued ordinary shares of Wal-Mart not already held by that person or a person connected to that person, such offer having been made on a condition such that, if it was met, that person would obtain Control of Wal-Mart, or 

(b) 
    to acquire all the shares in Wal-Mart of the same class as the Shares (not already held by that person or a person connected to that person)  
     provided that any condition subject to which the offer is made has been satisfied; or 
           (ii) 
    the sale of more than half of the issued share capital of the Company or the undertaking of the business of the Company to any company which is not an Associated Company of Wal-Mart. 
              8.2 
    Subject to the Option not having lapsed under Rule 7.2, if, in consequence of Wal-Mart coming under the Control of another person as set out in paragraph 37(6C)(a) of Schedule 3, the shares in Wal-Mart to which an Option relates no longer meet the requirements of Part 4 of Schedule 3, the Option may be exercised no later than 20 days after the day on which such person obtains such Control, notwithstanding that the shares no longer meet those requirements (and see Rule 7.2(H) regarding time of lapsing). 
              8.3 
    In addition to Rules 8.1 and 8.2, an Option which is exercised no earlier than 20 days before the relevant date for the purposes of paragraph 37(2) of Schedule 3 is to be treated as if it had been exercised in accordance with Rule 8.1(i)   PROVIDED THAT   any such exercise in anticipation shall be treated as having had no effect if the relevant date for the purposes of paragraph 37(2) of Schedule 3 does not fall within the period of 20 days beginning with the date on which the Option is exercised   6   . 
               (A) 
    "  connected  " has the meaning given in section 718 ITEPA; and  
              (B) 
    a person is to be treated as obtaining Control of a company if that person and others acting in concert together obtain Control of it. 
              8.5 
    For the purposes of Rule 8.1(i), it does not matter if the general offer is made to different shareholders by different means. 
              9. 
    Grant of New Options 
              9.1 
    If an Acquiring Company obtains Control of Wal-Mart or acquires the shares or business of the Company in the circumstances set out in Rule 8.1 the Option Holder may at any time within the six month period beginning with the date referred to in Rule 8.1 by agreement with the Acquiring Company release any unexercised Option ("Old Option") then held by him in consideration for the grant to him of a New Option. 
       
   6    Current HMRC guidance indicates that Rule 8.3 will only apply to Options granted on/after 20 March 2015, the date the rules were amended. 

(A) 
    for such a number of New Shares as shall have substantially the same total Market Value immediately after the Release Date as the total Market Value of the Shares which were the subject of the Old Option immediately before the Release Date   PROVIDED THAT   if the Shares are subject to a Restriction, the Market Value for these purposes shall be determined as if they were not subject to the Restriction, 
              (B) 
    exercisable in the same manner as the Old Option, 
              (C) 
    deemed to have been granted on the Date of Grant of the corresponding Old Option, and 
              (D) 
    subject to the provisions of the Sharesave Plan as it had effect immediately before the Release Date but so that (save and except for Rules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14.4 and 15) references to the "Company" and "Wal-Mart" shall be construed as references to the "New Company" and references to "Options" shall be construed as references to "New Options." 
              9.3 
    The total amount payable by an Option Holder upon the exercise of the New Option shall be substantially the same as the total amount that would have been payable by him upon the exercise of the Old Option. 
              9.4 
    For the purposes of this Rule 9, the Market Value of any shares shall be determined using a methodology agreed by HMRC. 
               10.1 
    In order to exercise an Option in whole or in part the Option Holder must:- 
              (A) 
    Give notice (which may be in electronic form) to the Company Secretary (or the person appointed by the Board for the purpose), in such manner as the Company may from time to time require and notify to Option Holders. 
              (B) 
    The notice must be accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price or must authorise the Appropriate Authority to make such payment on behalf of the Option Holder. 
              10.2 
    An Option may be exercised in whole or in part provided that partial exercise shall be of not less than 10 per cent of the Shares comprised in the Option. 
              10.3 
    The date the Exercise Notice is received in accordance with Rule 10.1 shall constitute for all purposes the Receipt Date of such Option.  The Company will ensure that the Option is exercised within 30 Business Days of the Receipt Date. 
              10.4 
    If the Option becomes exercisable before the relevant Bonus Date it shall be exercisable over not more than the number of Shares the aggregate Option Price of which is as nearly as possible equal to but not more than the total repayment due on the Receipt Date and the Option shall not be exercisable over any Shares in excess of that number. 

10.5 
    All allotments and issues or transfers of Shares (as the case may be) will be made within 30 Business Days of the Receipt Date and will be subject to all (if any) necessary consents of any governmental or other authorities under enactments or regulations for the time being in force.  It shall be the responsibility of the Option Holder to comply with any requirements to be fulfilled in order to obtain or obviate the necessity for any such consent.  A share certificate or such other form of acknowledgment of shareholding as is then prescribed in respect of such Shares so issued or transferred shall be sent to the person exercising the Option at his risk. 
              10.6 
    If under the terms of an announcement made by Wal-Mart a dividend is to be or is proposed to be paid to the holders of Shares, the Shares to be issued on the exercise of an Option after the date of such announcement will not rank for such dividend and the Shares to be transferred on the exercise of an Option after the date of such announcement will be transferred without the right to receive any such dividend and any such right to that dividend will be retained by the transferor.  Subject as aforesaid the Shares so to be issued shall be identical and rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid registered Shares in issue on the Receipt Date. 
              10.7 
    Where the Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other market or recognised investment exchange as defined in section 285 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Board shall as soon as practicable apply to the New York Stock Exchange for admission of such Shares to the New York Stock Exchange or such other market or recognised investment exchange (as appropriate). 
              11. 
    Variation of Capital 
              11.1 
    Upon the occurrence of an Issue or Variation the restriction on the number of Shares available for the offer of Options set out in Rule 3.1 and the number or nominal amount of Shares comprised in each Option and the Option Price may be adjusted in such manner as the Board may determine   7      PROVIDED THAT  :- 
              (A) 
    other than in the event of a capitalisation issue, written confirmation of the Auditors is obtained that in their opinion the adjustments are fair and reasonable, 
              (B) 
    the total Market Value of the Shares over which an Option subsists is substantially the same immediately before and immediately after the adjustment, 
              (C) 
    the total amount payable on the exercise of an Option in full is substantially the same immediately before and immediately after the adjustment, and 
              (D) 
    if it is intended that this Sharesave Plan shall continue to be a Schedule 3 SAYE Option Scheme, no adjustment shall be made which would result in the requirements of Schedule 3 not being met in relation to an Option. 
       
   7    Finance Act 2014 removed the requirement for HMRC to approve adjustments in these circumstances, however HMRC guidance (ESSUM 35160) still states that: "where there is a variation in the share capital of the company, the agreement of HMRC's Shares   Assets Valuation must be secured." 

11.2 
    For the purposes of this paragraph, if the Shares are subject to a Restriction, the Market Value shall be determined as if they were not subject to the Restriction. 
              11.3 
    Notice of any such adjustment shall be given to the Option Holder by the Board, which may be in electronic form and may call in Option certificates for endorsement or replacement. 
      Subject to the Option not having lapsed under Rule 7.2, if the Company convenes a general meeting for the purpose of considering a resolution for voluntary winding up, the Board shall notify Option Holders of the date of such meeting and Options may be exercised within 28 days of the passing of the resolution.

   Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    Overview 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units in various formats around the world.  Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. 
             
    Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the United States ("U.S."), Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately   60%   of our net sales in fiscal   2015   and, of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. 
                
    Walmart International consists of operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses.  These businesses consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash   carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  Walmart International generated approximately   28%   of our fiscal   2015   net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. 
                
    Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately   12%   of our fiscal   2015   net sales.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. 
     Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently, but each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years. 
  Through the operations in each of our segments, we help people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping.  Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets we operate.  Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.  Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries.  Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity.  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.  
  Our fiscal year ends on   January 31   for our U.S. and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.  Historically, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending   January 31  . 
  This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  "),   January 31, 2014   ("fiscal   2014  ") and   January 31, 2013   ("fiscal   2013  "), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.   
  Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.  The  
    3 

     Table of Contents  

   amounts disclosed for "Corporate and support" in the leverage discussion of the Company's performance metrics consist of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.  
  Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart's definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales.  We measure the e-commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and fulfilled through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online, but fulfilled through our stores and clubs.  Changes in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in retail square feet of more than five percent.  Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
  In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  When we refer to constant currency operating results, we are referring to our operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods.  The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better Walmart's underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. 
  We made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year.  These reclassifications did not impact the Company's operating income or consolidated net income.  Additionally, certain prior period segment asset and expense allocations have been reclassified among segments to be comparable with the current period presentation. 
  The Retail Industry 
  We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence.  We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees (whom we call "associates").  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be located in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2015  , and in the discussion under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2015  .  
    Company Performance Metrics 
  Our performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value: growth, leverage and returns.  Our priority of growth focuses on sales through growth in net sales, comparable store and club sales, including e-commerce sales, and unit square feet growth; the priority of leverage encompasses our objective to increase our operating income at the same rate as or a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing our operating, selling, general and administrative expenses ("operating expenses") at a slower rate than the growth of our net sales; and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently we employ assets through return on investment and how effectively we manage working capital through free cash flow.  While all three priorities are important, our top priority is growth, with increased investment in digital retail and our associates.  Sales growth will contribute to improving leverage and returns over time.

   Growth 
  Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales increased   1.9%   and   1.6%   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in net sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to   3.0%   year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales across the Company.  The increase was partially offset by   $5.3 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal   2015  .  The increase in net sales for fiscal   2014   was due to   3.1%   growth in retail square feet, higher e-commerce sales, the impact of fiscal 2013 acquisitions and positive comparable club sales at Sam's Club.  The increase in net sales for fiscal   2014   was partially offset by   $5.1 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  
  Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales 
  Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.  As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our calendar comparable store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases.  Calendar comparable store and club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , were as follows: 

Comparable store and club sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased     0.5%     in fiscal     2015     and decreased     0.5%     in fiscal     2014  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The fiscal   2015   total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by higher traffic and lower gas prices during the end of the fiscal year.  E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately   0.3%   and   0.2%   for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2015  .  For fiscal 2014, the total U.S. comparable store and club sales were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to the slow recovery in general economic conditions, the 2% increase in the 2013 payroll tax rate, and the reduction in government food benefits and severe winter storms that occurred during the fourth quarter.  These factors were partially offset by increased member traffic at Sam's Club primarily coming from Savings Members.  Additionally, e-commerce sales positively impacted the Walmart U.S. comparable store and Sam's Club comparable club sales percentages by approximately 0.3% for fiscal 2014. 
    
  As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.  We estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately   0.9%   and   0.8%   in fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened.

   Leverage 
  Operating Income 

We believe comparing both the growth of our operating expenses and our operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful measures, as they indicate how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses.  Our objective for a fiscal year is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at the same rate as or a faster rate than net sales.  On occasion, we may make strategic growth investments that may, at times, cause our operating expenses to grow at a faster rate than net sales and that may result in our operating income growing at a slower rate than net sales. 
  Operating Expenses 
  For fiscal   2015  , operating expenses increased   2.3%  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, while net sales increased   1.9%  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Accordingly, we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales.  Our continued investments in digital retail, higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation, the   $249 million   impact of wage and hour litigation in the U.S., as well as expenses of $148 million related to the closure of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan were the primary factors that caused us not to leverage for fiscal   2015  .  For fiscal   2014  , we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 27 basis points.  Overall, lower than anticipated sales, higher investment in key areas, such as global leverage and digital retail initiatives, and the nearly $1.0 billion of increased expenses for various matters described in the Walmart International segment discussion, were the primary cause for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company announced a new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and educational programs.  We anticipate the additional expenses in fiscal 2016 resulting from these programs will be approximately $1.0 billion, which may impact our ability to leverage operating expenses in fiscal 2016. 
  Operating Income 
  For fiscal   2015  , we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or a faster rate than net sales as operating income increased   1.0%  , while net sales increased   1.9%   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  This was primarily due to the factors we discussed for not leveraging operating expenses.  For fiscal   2014  , we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales as operating income decreased 3.1% while net sales increased 1.6%, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  This was primarily due to the factors we discussed for not leveraging operating expenses, partially offset by increases in membership and other income of 5.6%.

  Management believes return on investment ("ROI") is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. 
  ROI was   16.9%   and   17.0%   for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and digital retail initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
  We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight.  When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. 
  Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI.  In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.  We consider return on assets ("ROA") to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. 
  Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI before comparing our ROI to that of such other companies.

   The calculation of ROI, along with a reconciliation to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:   

(1)  The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

   Free Cash Flow 
  Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.      Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
  We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We generated free cash flow of   $16.4 billion  ,   $10.1 billion   and   $12.7 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The increase in free cash flow for fiscal   2015  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the timing of income tax payments, combined with lower capital expenditures.  The fiscal   2014   decline in free cash flow, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments, as well as lower income from continuing operations and slightly higher capital expenditures.  
  Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies. 
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. 

(1)  "Net cash used in investing activities" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.

   Results of Operations 
  Consolidated Results of Operations 

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased   2.0%   and   1.6%   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in total revenues was consistent with the   1.9%   and   1.6%   increases in net sales.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to   3.0%   year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales across the Company.  The increase was partially offset by   $5.3 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal   2015  .  The increase in net sales for fiscal   2014   was due to   3.1%   growth in retail square feet, higher e-commerce sales, the impact of fiscal 2013 acquisitions and positive comparable club sales at Sam's Club.  The increase in net sales for fiscal   2014   was partially offset by   $5.1 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  An increase in membership and other income in both fiscal years, primarily due to growth in membership income at Sam's Club, also contributed to the increase in total revenues. 
  Our gross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal   2015  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  While the gross profit rate at Walmart International increased, the gross profit rate at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club decreased.  Our gross profit rate decreased 3 basis points for fiscal 2014, when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to our ongoing investment in price, as well as merchandise mix. 
  For fiscal   2015  , we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased   6   basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.  Our continued investments in digital retail, higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation, the   $249 million   impact of wage and hour litigation in the U.S., as well as expenses of $148 million related to the closure of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan were the primary factors that caused us not to leverage for fiscal   2015  .  For fiscal 2014, we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 27 basis points.  Overall, lower than anticipated net sales, higher investment in key areas, such as global leverage and e-commerce initiatives, and nearly $1.0 billion of increased expenses for various matters described in the Walmart International segment discussion, were the primary cause for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
  For fiscal   2015  , we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or a faster rate than net sales as operating income increased   1.0%   while net sales increased   1.9%   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  This was primarily due to the factors we discussed for not leveraging operating expenses.  For fiscal 2014, we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales as operating income decreased 3.1% while net sales increased 1.6%, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  This was primarily due to the factors we discussed for not leveraging operating expenses, partially offset by increases in membership and other income. 
  Our effective income tax rates were   32.2%  ,   32.9%   and 31.0%, for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported   $16.8 billion  ,   $16.6 billion   and   $17.7 billion   of consolidated income from continuing operations for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, an increase of   $263.0 million   for fiscal   2015   and a decrease of $1.1 billion for fiscal   2014   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Diluted income from continuing operations per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was   $4.99  ,   $4.85   and   $5.01   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

   Walmart U.S. Segment 

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased   3.1%   and   1.8%   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2015, the increase in net sales was due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of   3.2%  , as well as an increase in comparable store sales of   0.6%  .  Positive traffic and lower gas prices late in the fiscal year contributed to the increase in comparable store sales.  For fiscal   2014  , the increase in net sales was due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.9%, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of   0.6%  .  Fiscal 2014 comparable store sales were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to the slow recovery in general economic conditions, the 2% increase in the 2013 payroll tax rate and the reduction in government food benefits.   
  The fiscal   2015   gross profit rate decreased   12   basis points compared to the previous fiscal year.  The decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily the result of the segment's strategic focus on price investment, pharmacy cost inflation, reductions in third-party reimbursement rates and changes in merchandise mix.  The fiscal year 2014 gross profit rate was relatively flat when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to price investment and low price leadership, partially offset by cost of goods savings initiatives and supply chain productivity.   
  Walmart U.S. did not leverage operating expenses for fiscal   2015  , as operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased   24   basis points.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily driven by higher health-care expenses from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation.  In addition, expenses from severe winter storms early in the year contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales.  Walmart U.S. leveraged operating expenses for fiscal   2014  , driven by productivity initiatives as well as lower incentive expenses in fiscal   2014  . 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was   $21.3 billion  ,   $21.8 billion   and   $21.1 billion   during fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and 2013, respectively.  Walmart U.S. did not grow operating income faster than sales during fiscal   2015  , but grew operating income faster than sales during fiscal   2014  .

   Walmart International Segment 

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased   0.3%   and increased   1.3%   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2015  , the decrease in net sales was due to   $5.3 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, partially offset by year-over-year net growth in retail square feet of   2.6%   and higher e-commerce sales in each country with e-commerce operations, particularly in the United Kingdom, China and Brazil.  For fiscal   2014  , the increase in net sales was due to year-over-year net growth in retail square feet of 3.6% and the impact of fiscal 2013 acquisitions, which accounted for $730 million of the net sales increase.  In addition, higher e-commerce sales in each country with e-commerce operations contributed to the increase.  The increase in net sales was partially offset by $5.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
  Gross profit rate increased   12   basis points for fiscal   2015   and decreased 10 basis points for fiscal   2014  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The fiscal   2015   increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to changes in the merchandise mix in a number of the segment's larger operations.  The fiscal 2014 decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to price investments in certain countries, including Brazil, Canada and Mexico. 
  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased   51   basis points for fiscal   2015  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The decrease was due to the nearly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal   2014   detailed below, which were partially offset by fiscal   2015   expenses of $148 million related to the closure of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan. 
  For fiscal   2014  , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 80 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were primarily impacted by the nearly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses for the following matters: 
             
    Charges for contingencies for non-income taxes and employment claims in Brazil; 
                
    Charges for the closure of 29 units in China and 25 units in Brazil due to poor performance; 
                
    Store lease expenses in China and Mexico to correct a historical accounting practice that did not conform to our global accounting policies; and 
                
    Expenses for the termination of the joint venture, franchise and supply agreements related to our former partner's retail store operations in India. 
     As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was   $6.2 billion  ,   $5.2 billion   and   $6.4 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating income   $225 million  , $26 million and $111 million in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   respectively.  Although currency fluctuations caused net sales for Walmart International to decline, operating income grew for fiscal   2015  .  Operating income did not grow faster than net sales in fiscal   2014  .

   Sam's Club Segment 
  We believe the information in the following table under the caption "Excluding Fuel" is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.  Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.  

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased   1.5%   and   1.3%   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The fiscal   2015   increase in net sales was primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of   2.5%  , driven by the addition of 15 new clubs, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to the lower average selling price.  Comparable club sales were flat for fiscal   2015  .  The fiscal   2014   increase in net sales was due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.1%, driven by the addition of 12 new clubs, as well as positive comparable club sales of 0.3%.  The fiscal 2014 positive comparable club sales were the result of increased member traffic primarily coming from our Savings Members, partially offset by severe winter storms that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2014  . 
  Gross profit rate decreased   12   basis points for fiscal   2015   and was flat for fiscal   2014  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2015  , the gross profit rate decreased primarily due to the segment's investment in the Cash Rewards program, changes in merchandise mix, and commodity cost inflation, partially offset by an increased gross profit rate on fuel sales.  For fiscal 2014, our gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase to our product warranty liabilities, which was offset by a favorable impact from merchandise mix. 
  Membership and other income increased   7.7%   and 14.1% for fiscal   2015   and 2014, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2015  , the increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades, Plus Member renewals and an increase in members from the opening of 15 new clubs.  For fiscal   2014  , the increase was primarily due to improved contract terms relating to the profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider, increased membership fees that were introduced on May 15, 2013, $24 million of income from the sale of two real estate properties and an increase in members from the opening of 12 new clubs. 
  Sam's Club leveraged operating expenses for fiscal   2015  , as operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased   16   basis points compared to the previous fiscal year.  The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal   2015   was primarily due to better expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the new in-club staffing structure announced in fiscal   2014  , which resulted in decreases in wage expense and payroll taxes.  This was partially offset by higher health-care expenses, mostly from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation.  For fiscal   2014  , Sam's Club did not leverage expenses, as operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 26 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a $59 million charge for the implementation of the new in-club staffing structure and the pending closure of one club, as well as a state excise tax refund credit we received in the previous fiscal year. 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income was   $2.0 billion  ,   $1.8 billion   and   $1.9 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and 2013, respectively.  Sam's Club did grow operating income faster than net sales in fiscal   2015  , but did not grow operating income faster than sales in fiscal   2014  .

   Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.   
  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was   $28.6 billion  ,   $23.3 billion   and   $25.6 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal   2015  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the timing of income tax payments.  The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal   2014  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments, as well as lower income from continuing operations.  
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company announced a new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and educational programs.  We anticipate cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund these programs. 
  Cash Equivalents and Working Capital 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $9.1 billion   and   $7.3 billion   for fiscal   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Our working capital deficit was   $2.0 billion   and   $8.2 billion   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily the result of using less of our net cash provided by operating activities for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal   2015  , which allowed us to reduce our short-term borrowings.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 
  We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.  We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings.  Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.  When the income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, we realize an effective tax rate benefit.  If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.  As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $1.7 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.  We do not expect local laws, other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.  
    
  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was   $11.1 billion  ,   $12.5 billion   and   $12.6 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, and generally consisted of payments to add stores, remodel numerous existing stores, expand our digital retail capabilities and invest in other technologies.  Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $1.4 billion   for fiscal   2015  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to lower capital expenditures.  The following table provides additional capital expenditure detail:

       Table of Contents  

Also reducing net cash used in investing activities were cash proceeds of   $671 million   received from the sale of the Vips Restaurant Business in Mexico ("Vips") on   May 12, 2014  , which is further described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We continue to focus on striving to seamlessly integrate the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanded in digital retail in each of our segments during fiscal   2015  , with Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club focused on digital retail in the U.S. and Walmart International focused on digital retail in countries outside of the U.S.  Some of our fiscal   2015   accomplishments in this area were to successfully launch our new web platform in the U.S., grow mobile and increase our third-party marketplace offering. 
  Growth Activities 
  In fiscal   2016  , we plan to add between 26 and 30 million square feet, which will include a continued investment in Neighborhood Markets and a moderation of Supercenter growth in the U.S. compared to recent fiscal years.  In addition, we plan to accelerate the growth of our digital retail capabilities by investing   $1.2 billion   to   $1.5 billion   in e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications that will include technology, infrastructure and other areas to better serve our customers and support our stores and clubs.  We anticipate financing these growth activities through cash flows provided by operating activities and future debt financings.   
  The following table provides our estimated range for fiscal   2016   capital expenditures, as well as our estimated range for growth in retail square feet.  Our anticipated digital retail expenditures are included in our estimated range for fiscal   2016   capital expenditures.  The amounts in the table do not include capital expenditures or growth in retail square feet from any pending or future acquisitions.

   Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

Cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, as well as dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.  Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.  
  Short-term Borrowings 
  Short-term borrowings decreased   $6.3 billion   for fiscal   2015   and increased   $0.9 billion   for fiscal   2014  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding used for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.  However, more cash provided from operating activities combined with less cash used for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal   2015  , allowed us to minimize our short-term borrowings at   January 31, 2015  .  In addition to our short-term borrowings, we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit that provide   $15.0 billion   of additional liquidity, if needed. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal   2015  :   

  Our total outstanding long-term debt balance was relatively flat as of January 31, 2015 compared to the balance as of January 31, 2014.  During fiscal   2015  , we used the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt to pay down and refinance existing debt and for other corporate purposes. 
  Dividends 
  Our total dividend payments were   $6.2 billion  ,   $6.1 billion   and   $5.4 billion   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, and on   February 19, 2015  , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal   2016   annual dividend of $  1.96   per share, an increase compared to the fiscal   2015   annual dividend of   $1.92   per share.  For fiscal   2016  , the annual dividend will be paid in   four   quarterly installments of   $0.49   per share, according to the following record and payable dates: 

Company Share Repurchase Program  
  From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.  The current   $15.0 billion   share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases.  At   January 31, 2015  , authorization for   $10.3 billion   of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.   
    16 

       Table of Contents  

   We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  :   

We decreased the total cash paid for share repurchases by   $5.7 billion   for fiscal   2015  , compared to the previous fiscal year, as a result of current cash needs, capacity for leverage and increased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below.  In addition, our results of operations influenced our share repurchase activity. 
    
  Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests 
  As described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, during fiscal   2015  , we completed the purchase of substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash to complete this transaction. 
    
  Capital Resources 
  We believe cash flows from continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, including to fund seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories, and to fund our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases. 
  We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  At   January 31, 2015  , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: 
                       Rating agency 
       
    Commercial paper 
       
    Long-term debt 
      Standard   Poor's 
       
    A-1+ 
       
    AA 
      Moody's Investors Service 
       
    P-1 
       
    Aa2 
      Fitch Ratings 
       
    F1+ 
       
    AA 

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 
  We monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing using various qualitative and quantitative factors, including our debt-to-total capitalization, as support for our long-term financing decisions.  For the purpose of the debt-to-total capitalization calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due within one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases.  Total capitalization is defined as debt plus total Walmart shareholders' equity.  At   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , the ratio of our debt-to-total capitalization was   38.2%   and   42.6%  , respectively.  The decrease in our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was the result of using less cash for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal   2015  , which allowed us to minimize our short-term borrowings at   January 31, 2015  .  The reduced share repurchases also resulted in increased growth in retained earnings.  These impacts were partially offset by additional currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

   Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  
    
  The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments: 

(1) 
    "Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classified as fair value hedges.   
              (2) 
    "Capital lease obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease obligations that are not yet recorded.  Refer to Note 11 in the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information. 
     Additionally, the Company has   $15.0 billion   in undrawn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at   January 31, 2015  , and management's forecasted market rates for our variable rate debt. 
  Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts.  Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included in the table above.  Purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods.  We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 
  The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. 
  In addition to the amounts shown in the table above,   $838 million   of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities.  The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain.  Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. 
    Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations presented above, we have entered into certain arrangements, as discussed below, for which the timing of payment, if any, is unknown. 
  The Company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately   282   future locations.  These lease commitments have lease terms ranging from   1   to   30   years and provide for certain minimum rentals.  If executed, payments under operating leases would increase by   $58 million   for fiscal   2016  , based on current estimates. 
  In connection with certain long-term debt issuances, we could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur.  At   January 31, 2015  , the aggregate termination payment would have been   $64 million  .  The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal   2019  .

   Market Risk 
  In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
  The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes.  The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.  In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances.  We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps.  For fiscal   2015  , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased approximately   $158 million   primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates and the termination of forward starting receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate swaps in October and April 2014 concurrently with the issuance of debt. 
  The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For debt obligations, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts.  The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at   January 31, 2015  . 

(1) 
    The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. 
     As of   January 31, 2015  , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented   7%   of our total short-term and long-term debt.  Based on   January 31, 2015   debt levels, a   100   basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately   $23 million  .

   Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S.  For fiscal   2015  , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico and Chile were the primary cause of the   $3.6 billion   net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges.   
  We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt.  The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of   $110 million   at   January 31, 2015   and in an asset position of   $550 million   at   January 31, 2014  .  The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the latter half of fiscal   2015  .  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at   January 31, 2015   would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of   $435 million  .  A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at   January 31, 2015   would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of   $20 million  . 
  In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations.  At   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , we had    2.5 billion   of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom.  At   January 31, 2015  , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of   $342 million  .  In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of    100 billion   at   January 31, 2015   and    200 billion   at   January 31, 2014  , that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan.  At   January 31, 2015  , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of   $77 million  .  
  Other Matters 
  We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal   2015  , including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the caption "Risk Factors" and in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "FCPA Investigation and Related Matters."

   Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.  In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.  Actual results may differ from our estimates. 
  Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. 
  Inventories 
  We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories.  The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.  The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the LIFO method. 
  Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's retail value.  The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity.  The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns.  The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized.  Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage.  When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded.  Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends.  Changes in weather and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. 
  When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.  Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices.  At   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. 
  We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales.  Following annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results.  
  Impairment of Assets 
  We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows.  The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level.  The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics.  Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.  These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. 
  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired.  Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.  The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.  These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach.  Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets.  Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. 
    21 

       Table of Contents  

   As of January 31, 2015, the fair value of certain recently acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets approximated their carrying value of $419 million.  Any deterioration in the fair value of these assets would result in a related impairment charge.  Management will continue to monitor the fair value of these assets in future periods. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.   
  Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.  When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.  We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. 
  Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.  Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.

   Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
    Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  General 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through the Company's e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping.  Each week, the Company serves nearly 260 million customers who visit its over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries.  The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. 
  The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  "),   January 31, 2014   ("fiscal   2014  ") and   January 31, 2013   ("fiscal   2013  ").  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method.  These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on   January 31,   for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during January   2015   that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All credit card, debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents.  The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled   $2.9 billion   and   $1.6 billion   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  In addition, cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of   $345 million   and   $654 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements. 
  The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world.  Of the Company's   $9.1 billion   and   $7.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively,   $6.3 billion   and   $5.8 billion  , respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.   
  The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.  Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings.  Accordingly, the Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.  When the income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit.  If the Company's intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.  As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $1.7 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.  The Company does not expect local laws, other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

     Table of Contents  

   Receivables 
  Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts.  Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from: 
             
    insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; 
                
    banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; 
                
    consumer financing programs in certain international operations; 
                
    suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and 
                
    real estate transactions. 
     The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select markets.  The receivable balance from consumer credit products was $  1.2 billion  , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of   $114 million   at   January 31, 2015  , compared to a receivable balance of $  1.3 billion  , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $  119 million   at   January 31, 2014  .  These balances are included in receivables, net, in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Inventories 
  The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories.  The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.  The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the LIFO method.  At   January 31, 2015   and   January 31, 2014  , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred.  Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.  The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term.  Depreciation expense for property and equipment, including amortization of property under capital leases, for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   $9.1 billion  ,   $8.8 billion   and   $8.4 billion  , respectively.  Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were   $59 million  ,   $78 million   and   $74 million   in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
  Long-Lived Assets 
  Long-lived assets are stated at cost.  Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level or, in certain circumstances, a market group of stores.  Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.  Impairment charges of long-lived assets for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were not significant.

   Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired.  Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. 
  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.  Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.  The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units.  Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches.   
  The Company's reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test.  Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. 
  The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal   2015   and   2014  : 

(1) 
    Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2015 and 2014 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.   
     Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions.  There were no impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  Self Insurance Reserves 
  The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and the Company's obligation for employee-related health care benefits.  Liabilities relating to the claims associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience, frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, including incurred but not reported claims.  In estimating its liability for such claims, the Company periodically analyzes its historical trends, including loss development, and applies appropriate loss development factors to the incurred costs associated with the claims.  To limit exposure to certain risks, the Company maintains stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation of   $5 million   per occurrence, and in most instances,   $15 million   per occurrence for general liability.

   Income Taxes 
  Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.   
  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.   
  In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.  Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
  The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. 
  Revenue Recognition       
  Sales 
  The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer.  
  Membership Fee Revenue 
  The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.  The following table summarizes membership fee activity for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The deferred membership fee is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Shopping Cards 
  Customer purchases of shopping cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the shopping card.  Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely.  Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates.  A certain number of shopping cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed.  Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards and recognizes revenue for these amounts over shopping card historical usage periods based on historical redemption rates.  Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates of usage periods and redemption rates.   
  Financial and Other Services 
  The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed.  Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Table of Contents  

   Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.  Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. 
  Payments from Suppliers 
  The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures.  Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. 
  Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above.  As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. 
  Advertising Costs 
  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were   $2.4 billion   for both fiscal   2015   and fiscal   2014   and   $2.3 billion   for fiscal   2013  .  Advertising costs consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Leases 
  The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company.  The expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense.  Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter.  If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. 
  Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. 
  Pre-Opening Costs 
  The cost of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed as incurred and included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Pre-opening costs totaled   $317 million  ,   $338 million   and   $316 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
  Currency Translation 
  The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The income statements of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to previous fiscal year amounts and balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year.  These reclassifications did not impact consolidated operating income or net income.  Additionally, certain segment asset and expense allocations have been reclassified among segments in the current period.  See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's segments.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  , which provides guidance for the recognition of discontinued operations, changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations.  This ASU applies to prospective transactions beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this ASU for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2015   and adoption did not materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted.  Accordingly, the Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2017.  Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU.  Management is currently evaluating this standard, including which transition approach to use, and does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows. 
    Note 2.  Net Income Per Common Share 
  Basic income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.  The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart:

   Note 3.  Shareholders' Equity 
  Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company.  The compensation expense recognized for all plans was   $462 million  ,   $388 million   and   $378 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  Share-based compensation expense is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was   $173 million  ,   $145 million   and   $142 million   for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type: 

The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2010 (the "Plan") became effective June 4, 2010 and amended and restated the Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2005.  The Plan was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance shares units and other equity compensation awards for which   210 million   shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.  
  The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: 
             
    Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units.    Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment.  Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from   0%   to   150%   of the original award amount.  Vesting periods for these awards are generally between   one   and   three   years.  Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period.  The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. 
                
    Restricted Stock Units.    Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period;   50%   vest   three   years from the grant date and the remaining   50%   vest   five   years from the grant date.  The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   was   9.5%  ,   10.3%   and   12.2%  , respectively. 
     In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over   three   years. The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the other line in the table above.

Share Repurchase Program 
  From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.  On   June 6, 2013  , the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous   $15.0 billion   share repurchase program, which had approximately   $712 million   of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new   $15.0 billion   share repurchase program, which was announced on   June 7, 2013  .  As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  At   January 31, 2015  , authorization for   $10.3 billion   of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.   
  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  :

   Note 4.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The following table provides the fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), including the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for fiscal   2015   and 2014:   

  Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for derivative instruments are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, and the amounts for the minimum pension liability are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  The Company's unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), were not significant as of   January 31, 2015   and   January 31, 2014  . 
    Note 5.  Accrued Liabilities 
  The Company's accrued liabilities consist of the following: 

(1) 
    Accrued wages and benefits include accrued wages, salaries, vacation, bonuses and other incentive plans. 
              (2) 
    Self-insurance consists of all insurance-related liabilities, such as workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property liability and employee-related health care benefits. 
              (3) 
    Accrued non-income taxes include accrued payroll, value added, sales and miscellaneous other taxes.   
              (4) 
    Other accrued liabilities consist of various items such as maintenance, utilities, advertising and interest.

   Note 6.  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt 
  Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit.  Short-term borrowings outstanding at   January 31, 2015   and   2014   were   $1.6 billion   and   $7.7 billion  , respectively.  The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

The Company has various committed lines of credit, committed with   23   financial institutions, totaling   $15.0 billion   as of   January 31, 2015   and with   24   financial institutions, totaling   $15.4 billion   as of   January 31, 2014  .  The committed lines of credit are summarized in the following table:   

(1)   
    In June 2014, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility, which is used to support its commercial paper program. 
              (2)   
    In June 2014, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, which is used to support its commercial paper program. 
     The committed lines of credit mature at various times between   June 2015   and   June 2019  , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus   10   basis points and LIBOR plus   75   basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between   1.5   and   4.0   basis points.  In conjunction with the lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. 
  Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling   $4.6 billion   and   $4.7 billion   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  These letters of credit are utilized in normal business activities.

   The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8, consists of the following: 

(1) 
    The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates.  Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivative financial instruments described in Note 8. 
              (2) 
    A portion of other debt at   January 31, 2015   and   2014   includes secured debt in the amount of   $139 million   and   $572 million  , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of approximately   $19 million   and   $471 million  , respectively. 
     At   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company had   $500 million   in debt with embedded put options.  The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the amount of   $500 million   is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate.  If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell, and the Company must repurchase, the notes at par.  Accordingly, this issuance has been classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
  Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

   Note 7.  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction.  The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 

Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
                
    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
                
    Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.       
     Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves.  As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: 

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.  The Company did not record any significant impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015  , or   2014  . 
  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
  The Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.  
  The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , are as follows:

   Note 8.  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.  Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.  Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change.  In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract.  The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.   
  The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies.  Subsequent to entering into derivative transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties.  In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of   $323 million   and $  641 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   January 31, 2014  , respectively.  The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset.  Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $  150 million   with any counterparty.  The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at   January 31, 2015   or   January 31, 2014  .  The Company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability. 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.  Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting.  If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings.  The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant.  Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.   
  Fair Value Instruments 
  The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt.  The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss.  The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges.  As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges.  Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  These fair value instruments will mature in   October 2020  . 
  Net Investment Instruments 
  The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments.  The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency.  All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  These instruments will mature on dates ranging from   October 2023   to   February 2030  . 
  The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations.  These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments.  Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  At   January 31, 2015   and   January 31, 2014  , the Company had    100 billion   and    200 billion  , respectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of    2.5 billion   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014   that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom.  These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from   July 2015   to   January 2039  .   
    44 

       Table of Contents  

   Cash Flow Instruments 
  The Company is a party to receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the interest rate risk of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk.  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these derivatives are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings as interest is expensed for the Company's variable-rate debt, converting the variable-rate interest expense into fixed-rate interest expense.  These cash flow instruments will mature in   July 2015  . 
  The Company is also a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt.  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are remeasured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows.  As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that remeasurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument.  These cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from   April 2022   to   March 2034  .   
  The Company used forward starting receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate swaps ("forward starting swaps") to hedge its exposure to the variability in future cash flows due to changes in the LIBOR swap rate for debt issuances forecasted to occur in the future.  These forward starting swaps were terminated in October 2014, April 2014 and April 2013 concurrently with the issuance of the hedged debt.  Upon termination of the forward starting swaps, the Company received net cash payments from the related counterparties of   $96 million   in fiscal   2015   and made net cash payments to the related counterparties of   $74 million   in fiscal   2014  .  The payments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified to earnings over the life of the related debt through May 2044, effectively adjusting interest expense to reflect the fixed interest rates entered into by the forward starting swaps. 
  Financial Statement Presentation 
  Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Derivative instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and those hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date.   
  The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets:   

  Gains and losses related to the Company's derivatives primarily relate to interest rate hedges, which are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income during the next 12 months are not significant.

A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: 

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation 
  The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company's significant accounting policies in Note 1.  The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate.  Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are not subject to current U.S. income tax.  A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:

       Table of Contents  

   Deferred Taxes 
  The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: 

The deferred taxes are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

Unremitted Earnings 
  U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries of approximately   $23.3 billion   and   $21.4 billion   as of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S.  However, if any portion were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings.  Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation.  The Company provides deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings. 
  Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances 
  At   January 31, 2015  , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately   $5.6 billion  .  Of these carryforwards, approximately   $2.9 billion   will expire, if not utilized, in various years through   2033  .  The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.  At   January 31, 2015  , the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of   $2.0 billion  , which will expire in various years through   2025  , if not utilized. 
  The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established.  If a valuation allowance has been established and management subsequently determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance is released. 
    47 

       Table of Contents  

   As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company had valuation allowances recorded of approximately   $1.5 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The   $0.3 billion   net decrease in the valuation allowance during fiscal   2015   related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal   2015  , decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be fully realized. 
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. 
  As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was   $838 million   and   $763 million  , respectively.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was   $763 million   and   $698 million   for   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations was as follows: 

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.  During fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company recognized interest and penalty expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions of   $18 million  ,   $(7) million   and   $2 million  , respectively.  As of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of   $57 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of   January 31, 2015   or   2014  . 
  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between   $50 million   and   $350 million  , either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance.  The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible.  As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months.  The Company does not expect any change to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal   2013   through   2015  .  The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal   2000   through   2015  , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended   2006   through   2015  . 
  Other Taxes 
  The Company is subject to tax examinations for payroll, value added, sales-based and other non-income taxes.  A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions, including Brazil.  In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations.  Where a probable loss has occurred, the Company has made accruals, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  While the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Note 10.  Contingencies 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings.  The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made.  However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed.  The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. 
  Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
  Wage-and-Hour Class Action:   The Company is a defendant in   Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  , a class-action lawsuit commenced in   March 2002   in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented class members from taking their full meal and rest breaks.  On   October 13, 2006  , a jury awarded back-pay damages to the plaintiffs of approximately   $78 million   on their claims for off-the-clock work and missed rest breaks.  The jury found in favor of the Company on the plaintiffs' meal-period claims.  On   November 14, 2007  , the trial judge entered a final judgment in the approximate amount of   $188 million  , which included the jury's back-pay award plus statutory penalties, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees.  By operation of law, post-judgment interest accrues on the judgment amount at the rate of   six percent   per annum from the date of entry of the judgment, which was   November 14, 2007  , until the judgment is paid, unless the judgment is set aside on appeal.  On   December 7, 2007  , the Company filed its Notice of Appeal.  On   June 10, 2011  , the Pennsylvania Superior Court of Appeals issued an opinion upholding the trial court's certification of the class, the jury's back pay award, and the awards of statutory penalties and prejudgment interest, but reversing the award of attorneys' fees.  On   September 9, 2011  , the Company filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  On   July 2, 2012  , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the Company's Petition.  On December 15, 2014, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued its opinion affirming the Superior Court of Appeals' decision.  At that time, the Company recorded expenses of   $249 million   for the judgment amount and post-judgment interest incurred to date.  The Company will continue to accrue for the post-judgment interest until final resolution.  However, the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to the claims at issue and, on March 13, 2015, the Company filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.

("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over   4,000   "equal value" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.  Claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higher wage rates on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings.  ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the near future.  On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims.  On March 23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules.  At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.  The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.

   FCPA Investigation and Related Matters 
  The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de M xico, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.  The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. 
  The Company is also conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.  When such allegations are reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, conduct inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, open investigations.  Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. 
  The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA.  The Company is cooperating with the investigations by the DOJ and the SEC.      A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.  Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations.  Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.  
  The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above.  There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties.  The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  The Company cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or its own internal investigations and review.  In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.  These costs will be expensed as incurred.  For the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:  

These matters may require the involvement of certain members of the Company's senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to the business.  The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters,     which     could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.     
  The Company's process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues.  While the Company believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.  Although the Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business in the future.

   Note 11.  Commitments  
  The Company has long-term leases for stores and equipment.  Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were   $2.8 billion   in both fiscal   2015   and   2014   and   $2.6 billion   in fiscal   2013  .  
  Aggregate minimum annual rentals at   January 31, 2015  , under non-cancelable leases are as follows: 

Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales.  Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  .  Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals. 
  The Company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately   282   future locations.  These lease commitments have lease terms ranging from   1   to   30   years and provide for certain minimum rentals.  If executed, payments under operating leases would increase by   $58 million   for fiscal 2016, based on current cost estimates. 
  In connection with certain long-term debt issuances, the Company could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur.  At   January 31, 2015  , the aggregate termination payment would have been   $64 million  .  The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal   2019  .

   Note 12.  Retirement-Related Benefits 
  The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire.  The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment.  Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches   100%   of participant contributions up to   6%   of annual eligible earnings.  The matching contributions immediately vest at   100%   for each associate.  Participants can contribute up to   50%   of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.  Participants age   50   or older may defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.  
  Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements.  These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.   
  Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans.  The plan in the United Kingdom was underfunded by   $85 million   and   $69 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The plan in Japan was underfunded by   $223 million   and   $281 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.  These underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other.  Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. 
  The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's retirement-related benefits for fiscal   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  : 

Note 13.  Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items 
  In fiscal 2015, the Company completed the following transactions that impact the operations of Walmart International: 
  Walmart Chile 
  In fiscal 2014, the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders exercised put options that required the Company to purchase their shares in Walmart Chile.  At that time, the Company recorded an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $1.0 billion  , with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value, to reflect the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest at   $1.5 billion  .  In February 2014, the Company completed this transaction using existing cash of the Company, increasing its ownership interest in Walmart Chile to   99.7 percent  .  In March 2014, the Company completed a tender offer for most of the remaining noncontrolling interest shares at the same value per share as was paid to the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders.  As a result of completing these transactions, the Company owns substantially all of Walmart Chile. 
  Vips Restaurant Business in Mexico 
  In September 2013, Walmex, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement with Alsea S.A.B. de C.V. to sell the Vips restaurant business ("Vips") in Mexico.  The sale of Vips was completed on   May 12, 2014  .  Upon completion of the sale, the Company received   $671 million   of cash and recognized a net gain of   $262 million  , which is recorded in discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2015  .

   Note 14.  Segments 
  The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results its chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 
  The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as walmart.com.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites.  The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.   
  The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.   
  Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

No individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.  Additionally, the Company did not generate material total revenues from any single customer.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015  .  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. at   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated   April 1, 2015   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "Management's Report to Our Shareholders."  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of   January 31, 2015   and   2014  , and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015   and our report dated   April 1, 2015   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  .  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be timely disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of   January 31, 2015  , and determined they were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
