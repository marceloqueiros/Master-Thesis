Competition  

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors
    include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms,
    investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment
    companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies,
    credit card issuers, mutual fund companies and
     e-commerce 
    and other internet-based companies in addition to those
    competitors discussed more specifically below. We compete with
    some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional
    or product basis. Competition is based on a number of factors
    including, among others, customer service, quality and range of
    products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates
    on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience.
    Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in
    large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain
    and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation
    and other costs.

More specifically, our  Deposits  business segment competes
    with banks, thrifts, credit unions, finance companies and other
    nonbank organizations offering financial services. Our  Global
    Commercial Banking  business segment competes with local,
    regional and international banks and nonbank financial
    organizations. Our  GBAM  and  GWIM  business segments
    compete with U.S. and international commercial banking and
    investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage
    firms, investment companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, private
    equity funds, trust banks, multi-family offices, advice
    boutiques and other organizations offering similar services and
    other investment alternatives available to investors. Our
     Home Loans   Insurance  business segment
    competes with banks, thrifts, mortgage brokers, Fannie Mae
    (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (collectively, the government
    sponsored enterprises (GSEs)), and other nonbank organizations
    offering mortgage banking, mortgage and insurance related
    services. Our  Global Card Services  business segment
    competes in the United States and internationally with banks,
    consumer finance companies and retail stores with private label
    credit and debit cards.

We also compete actively for funds. A primary source of funds
    for the Banks is deposits, and competition for deposits includes
    other deposit-taking organizations, such as banks, thrifts and
    credit unions, as well as money market mutual funds. Investment
    banks and other entities that became bank holding companies and
    financial holding companies as a result of the recent financial
    crisis are also competitors for deposits. In addition, we
    compete for funding in the domestic and international short-term
    and long-term debt securities capital markets.

Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry
    have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a
    broad range of financial services have been acquired by or
    merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. As a
    result, this consolidation within the financial services
    industry has significantly increased the capital base and
    geographic reach of some of our competitors and also hastened
    the globalization of the securities markets. These developments
    could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater
    capital and other resources or having stronger local presences
    and longer operating histories outside the United States.

Our ability to expand certain of our banking operations in
    additional U.S. states remains subject to various federal
    and state laws. See Government Supervision and
    Regulation   General below for a more detailed
    discussion of interstate banking and branching legislation and
    certain state legislation.

Employees  

As of December 31, 2010, there were approximately
    288,000 full-time equivalent employees with Bank of
    America. Of these employees, approximately 80,700 were employed
    within  Deposits , approximately 15,000 were employed
    within  Global Card Services , approximately 58,200 were
    employed within  Home Loans   Insurance ,
    approximately 7,100 were employed within  Global Commercial
    Banking , approximately 34,300 were employed within  GBAM
     and approximately 40,300 were employed within  GWIM .
    The remainder were employed elsewhere within our company
    including various staff and support functions.

None of our domestic employees is subject to a collective
    bargaining agreement. Management considers our employee
    relations to be good.

Acquisition and
    Disposition Activity  

As part of our operations, we regularly evaluate the potential
    acquisition of, and hold discussions with, various financial
    institutions and other businesses of a type eligible for
    financial holding company ownership or control. In addition, we
    regularly analyze the values of, and submit bids for, the
    acquisition of customer-based funds and other liabilities and
    assets of such financial institutions and other businesses. We
    also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of
    our assets, branches, subsidiaries or lines of businesses. As a
    general rule, we publicly announce any material acquisitions or
    dispositions when a material definitive agreement has been
    reached.

On January 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Merrill
    Lynch. Additional information on our acquisitions is included in
     Note 2   Merger and Restructuring Activity
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Government
    Supervision and Regulation  

The following discussion describes, among other things, elements
    of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding
    companies, financial holding companies and banks, including
    specific information about Bank of America. U.S. federal
    regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial
    holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of
    depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for
    the protection of stockholders and creditors. For additional
    information about recent regulatory programs, initiatives and
    legislation that impact us, see Regulatory Matters in the
    MD A beginning on page 56.

General  

As a registered financial holding company and bank holding
    company, Bank of America Corporation is subject to the
    supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of
    Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board).
    The Banks are organized as national banking associations, which
    are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC),
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal
    Reserve Board and other federal and state regulatory agencies.

A U.S. financial holding company, and the companies under
    its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered
     financial in nature  as defined by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve Board
    interpretations (including, without limitation, insurance and
    securities activities), and therefore may engage in a broader
    range of activities than permitted for bank holding companies
    and their subsidiaries, which are only permitted to engage in
    activities that are closely related to the business of banking.
    Unless otherwise limited by the Federal Reserve Board, a
    financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in
    activities considered financial in nature, either de novo or by
    acquisition, provided the financial holding company gives the
    Federal Reserve Board
     after-the-fact 
    notice of the new activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also
    permits national banks, such as the Banks, to engage in
    activities considered financial in nature through a financial
    subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and
    with the approval of the OCC. If the Federal Reserve Board finds
    that any of the Banks is not well-capitalized or well-managed,
    we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal
    Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and
    management requirements, which may contain additional
    limitations or conditions relating to our activities.

U.S. bank holding companies (including bank holding
    companies that also are financial holding companies) are also
    required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve
    Board before acquiring more than five percent of any class of
    voting stock of any non-affiliated bank. Pursuant to the
    Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of
    1994 (Interstate Banking and Branching Act), a bank holding
    company may acquire banks located in states other than its home
    state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisitions
    under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the

bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of
    time, not to exceed five years, and the federal requirement that
    the bank holding company, after and as a result of the proposed
    acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total
    amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the
    United States and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or
    greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state.
    Subject to certain restrictions, the Interstate Banking and
    Branching Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines
    to create interstate banks. At December 31, 2010, we
    controlled approximately 12 percent of the total amount of
    deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.

In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory
    agencies, we are subject to various other laws and regulations,
    as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory
    agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our
    operations and management and our ability to make distributions
    to stockholders. For example, our U.S. broker dealer
    subsidiaries are subject to regulation by and supervision of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock
    Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (FINRA); our commodities businesses in the United States are
    subject to regulation by and supervision of the Commodities
    Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); and our insurance activities
    are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance
    regulatory agencies.

Our
     non-U.S. businesses 
    are also subject to extensive regulation by various
     non-U.S. regulators, 
    including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and
    other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those
    businesses operate. Our financial services operations in the
    United Kingdom (U.K.) are subject to regulation by and
    supervision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In July
    of 2010, the U.K. proposed abolishing the FSA and replacing it
    with the Financial Policy Committee within the Bank of England
    (FPC) and two new Regulators, the Prudential Regulatory
    Authority (PRA) and the Consumer Protection and Markets
    Authority (CPMA). Our U.K. regulated entities will be subject to
    the supervision of the FPC within the Bank of England for
    prudential matters and the CPMA for conduct of business matters.
    The new financial regulatory structure is intended to be in
    place by the end of 2012. We continue to monitor the development
    and potential impact of this regulatory restructuring.

Changes in
    Legislation and Regulations  

Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the
    banking and financial services industries are frequently
    introduced in Congress, in state legislatures and before the
    various bank regulatory or financial regulatory agencies as well
    as by lawmakers and regulators in jurisdictions outside the
    United States where we operate. Congress and the federal
    government have continued to evaluate and develop legislation,
    programs and initiatives designed to, among other things,
    stabilize the financial and housing markets, stimulate the
    economy, including the federal government s foreclosure
    prevention program, and prevent future financial crises by
    further regulating the financial services industry. As a result
    of the recent financial crisis and the ongoing challenging
    economic environment, we anticipate additional legislative and
    regulatory proposals and initiatives as well as continued
    legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services
    industry. However, at this time we cannot determine the final
    form of any proposed programs or initiatives or related
    legislation, the likelihood and timing of any other future
    proposals or legislation, and the impact they might have on us.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
    Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act) was signed into
    law. The Financial Reform Act provides for sweeping financial
    regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct
    certain businesses.

The Financial Reform Act contains a broad range of significant
    provisions that could affect our businesses, including, without
    limitation, the following:

mandating that the Federal Reserve Board limit debit card
    interchange fees;

banning banking organizations from engaging in proprietary
    trading and restricting their sponsorship of, or investing in,
    hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited
    exceptions;

increasing regulation of the derivative markets through measures
    that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation
    and requiring clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing
    additional capital and margin requirements for derivative market
    participants;

changing the assessment base used in calculating FDIC deposit
    insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets less
    tangible capital;

providing for heightened capital, liquidity, and prudential
    regulation and supervision over systemically important financial
    institutions;

providing for new resolution authority to establish a process to
    unwind large systemically important financial institutions and
    requiring the development and implementation of recovery and
    resolution plans;

creating a new regulatory body to set requirements around the
    terms and conditions of consumer financial products and
    expanding the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer
    protection requirements over banks.

disqualifying trust preferred securities and certain other
    hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital;

including a variety of corporate governance and executive
    compensation provisions and requirements; and

requiring securitizers to retain a portion of the risk that
    would otherwise be transferred into certain securitization
    transactions.

The Financial Reform Act has had, and will continue to have, a
    significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee
    reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, by reducing
    available capital. The Financial Reform Act also has had and may
    continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of
    certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. As
    previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of the
    Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to final
    rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit card
    revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third
    quarter of 2011. In 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to
    the Financial

Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually. As a
    result, we recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment
    charge for  Global Card Services  of $10.4 billion in
    2010. The goodwill impairment analysis includes limited
    mitigation actions within  Global Card Services  to
    recapture the lost revenue. We have identified other potential
    mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of
    development and some of them may impact other segments. For
    additional information, refer to Complex Accounting
    Estimates   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
        Global Card Services Impairment, in the
    MD A beginning on page 110 and
     Note 10   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We anticipate that the final regulations associated with the
    Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain
    activities, including limitations on the use of a bank s
    own capital for proprietary trading and sponsorship or
    investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (Volcker
    Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are required to
    be in place by October 21, 2011, and the Volcker Rule
    becomes effective 12 months after such rules are final or
    on July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Volcker Rule
    then gives banking entities two years from the effective date
    (with opportunities for additional extensions) to bring
    activities and investments into conformance. In anticipation of
    the adoption of the final regulations, we have begun winding
    down our proprietary trading line of business. The ultimate
    impact of the Volcker Rule or the winding down of this business,
    and the time it will take to comply or complete, continues to
    remain uncertain. The final regulations issued may impose
    additional operational and compliance costs on us.

Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to
    broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to
    regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain
    derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for
    certain market participants and imposing position limits on
    certain
     over-the-counter 
    derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the
    SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings
    by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until
    July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to
    implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these
    derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,
    continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose
    additional operational and compliance costs on us and may
    require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively
    impact our revenues and results of operations.

Although the ratings agencies have indicated that our credit
    ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary,
    we would receive significant support from the
    U.S. government, all three major ratings agencies have
    indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they
    include in our ratings for government support for reasons
    arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or
    legislation. In the event of certain credit ratings downgrades,
    our access to credit markets, liquidity and our related funding
    costs would be materially adversely affected. For additional
    information about our credit ratings, see Capital Management and
    Liquidity Risk in the MD A beginning on pages 63 and 67,
    respectively.

Most provisions of the Financial Reform Act require various
    federal banking and securities regulators to issue regulations
    to clarify and implement its provisions or to conduct studies on
    significant issues. These proposed regulations and studies are
    generally subject to a public notice and comment period. The
    timing of issuance of final regulations, their effective dates
    and their potential impacts to our businesses will be determined
    over the coming months and years. As a result, the ultimate
    impact of the Financial Reform Act s final rules on our
    businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory
    interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of
    our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain
    provisions.

Capital and
    Operational Requirements  

The Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC have issued
    substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    applicable to U.S. banking organizations. In addition,
    these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a
    banking organization maintain capital above the minimum
    prescribed levels, whether because of its financial condition or
    actual or anticipated growth. The Federal Reserve Board s
    risk-based guidelines define a three-tier capital framework.
    Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders  equity,
    common equivalent securities (CES), trust preferred securities
    and noncontrolling interests in limited amounts and qualifying
    preferred stock, less goodwill and other adjustments. The
    Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which our
    previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities in
    the aggregate amount of $19.9 billion (approximately
    137 basis points (bps) of Tier 1 capital) at
    December 31, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1
    capital effective January 1, 2013. Tier 2 capital
    consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1
    capital, mandatorily convertible debt, limited amounts of
    subordinated debt, other qualifying term debt, the allowance for
    credit losses up to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets
    and other adjustments. Tier 3 capital includes subordinated
    debt that (i) is unsecured, (ii) is fully paid,
    (iii) has an original maturity of at least two years,
    (iv) is not redeemable before maturity without prior
    approval by the Federal Reserve Board and (v) includes a
    lock-in clause precluding payment of either interest or
    principal if the payment would cause the issuing bank s
    risk-based capital ratio to fall or remain below the required
    minimum. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less
    investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents qualifying
    total capital. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by
    dividing Tier 1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets,
    which is calculated by assigning assets and off-balance sheet
    exposures to one of four categories of risk-weights, based
    primarily on relative credit risk. The minimum Tier 1
    capital ratio is four percent and the minimum total capital
    ratio is eight percent. A  well-capitalized 
    institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps
    higher than the minimum guidelines.

Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios under these
    guidelines at December 31, 2010 were 11.24 percent and
    15.77 percent. At December 31, 2010, we had no
    subordinated debt that qualified as Tier 3 capital. While
    not an explicit requirement of law or regulation, bank
    regulatory agencies have stated that they expect shares of
    common stock to be the primary component of a financial holding
    company s Tier 1 capital and that financial holding
    companies should maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio of
    at least four percent. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is
    determined by dividing Tier 1 common capital by
    risk-weighted assets. We calculate Tier 1 common capital as
    Tier 1 capital, which includes CES, less preferred stock,
    trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and noncontrolling
    interest. As of December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 common
    capital ratio was 8.60 percent.

The leverage ratio is determined by dividing Tier 1 capital
    by adjusted quarterly average total assets, after certain
    adjustments.  Well-capitalized  bank holding companies
    must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent
    and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to
    maintain higher capital levels.  Well-Capitalized 
    national banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at
    least five percent and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board
    directive to maintain higher capital levels. Our leverage ratio
    at December 31, 2010 was 7.21 percent, which exceeded
    our leverage ratio requirement. For additional information about
    our calculation of regulatory capital and capital composition,
    see Capital Management   Regulatory Capital in the
    MD A beginning on page 63, and
     Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and
    Restrictions  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
    1991 (FDICIA), among other things, identifies five capital
    categories for insured

depository institutions (well-capitalized, adequately
    capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
    and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective
    federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for
     prompt corrective action  for insured depository
    institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements
    within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively restrictive
    constraints on operations, management and capital distributions,
    depending on the category in which an institution is classified.
    Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a
    banking institution to capital-raising requirements. An
     undercapitalized  bank must develop a capital
    restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee
    that bank s compliance with the plan. The liability of the
    parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to
    the lesser of five percent of the bank s assets at the time
    it became  undercapitalized  or the amount needed to
    comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the
    bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would
    take priority over the parent s general unsecured
    creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory
    agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety
    and soundness relating generally to operations and management,
    asset quality and executive compensation, and permits regulatory
    action against a financial institution that does not meet such
    standards.

The various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially
    similar regulations that define the five capital categories
    identified by FDICIA, using the total risk-based capital,
    Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios as
    the relevant capital measures. Such regulations establish
    various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an
    institution is considered undercapitalized. Under the
    regulations, a  well-capitalized  institution must
    have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least six
    percent, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least ten
    percent and a leverage ratio of at least five percent and not be
    subject to a capital directive order. Under these guidelines,
    each of the Banks was considered well capitalized as of
    December 31, 2010.

Pursuant to FDICIA, regulators also must take into
    consideration: (a) concentrations of credit risk;
    (b) interest rate risk; and (c) risks from
    non-traditional banking activities, such as derivatives,
    securities and insurance activities, as well as an
    institution s ability to manage those risks, when
    determining the adequacy of an institution s capital. This
    evaluation is made as a part of the institution s regular
    safety and soundness examination. In addition, Bank of America
    Corporation, and any Bank with significant trading activity,
    must incorporate a measure for market risk in their regulatory
    capital calculations.

In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the
    Basel Committee) published the Basel II Accord with the
    intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements
    with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While
    economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the
    Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to
    regulatory standards of capital adequacy. The Basel Committee,
    which consists of central banks and bank supervisors from 13
    countries including the United States, does not possess any
    formal supervisory or legal authority over institutions in its
    member countries. Instead, the Basel Committee formulates
    supervisory guidelines that it recommends to its member
    countries with the expectation that these guidelines will be
    implemented in a manner best suited to each country s own
    national system.

The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) was published in
    December 2007 and established requirements for
    U.S. implementation of the Basel II Rules and provided
    detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework.
    This regulatory capital framework includes requirements related
    to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory
    requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar
    3). The Corporation began Basel II parallel implementation
    on April 1, 2010.

Designated U.S. financial institutions are required to
    complete a minimum parallel qualification period under
    Basel II of four consecutive successful quarters before
    receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using
    the Basel II methodology and exiting the parallel period.
    During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations
    under both the current risk-based capital rules (Basel
    I) and Basel II will be reported to the financial
    institutions  regulatory supervisors. Once the parallel
    period is successfully completed and we have received approval
    to exit parallel, we will transition to Basel II as the
    methodology for calculating regulatory capital. Basel II
    provides for a three-year transitional floor subsequent to
    exiting parallel, after which Basel I may be discontinued. The
    Collins Amendment within the Financial Reform Act and the
    U.S. banking regulators  subsequent Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking published by the Federal Reserve Board on
    December 14, 2010 propose however that the current
    three-year transitional floors under Basel II be replaced
    with a permanent risk based capital floor as defined under Basel
    I.

On December 16, 2010, U.S. regulators issued a Notice
    of Proposed Rulemaking on the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines for
    Market Risk (Market Risk Rules), reflecting partial adoption of
    the Basel Committee s July 2009 consultative document on
    the topic. We anticipate U.S. regulators will adopt the
    Market Risk Rules in mid-2011. This change is expected to
    significantly increase the capital requirements for our trading
    assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposures which
    meet the definition established by the regulatory agencies. We
    continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules
    and currently anticipate being fully compliant with any final
    rules by the projected implementation date of year-end 2011.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued
     Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more
    resilient banks and banking systems  (Basel III), proposing
    a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented
    by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III could
    significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III
    and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of
    trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the
    Financial Reform Act proposing that the disqualification be
    phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the
    deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets,
    mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), investments in financial firms
    and pension assets, among others, within prescribed
    limitations), the inclusion of other comprehensive income in
    capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new
    minimum capital and buffer requirements. The phase-in period for
    the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent
    increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by
    December 31, 2018. The increase in capital requirements for
    counterparty credit risk is proposed to be effective January
    2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital
    requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between
    2013 and 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the
    final rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011 and
    have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by year-end 2011 or
    early 2012. For additional information on our MSRs, refer to
     Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on
    deferred tax assets, refer to  Note 21   Income
    Taxes  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

If Basel III is implemented in the U.S. consistent
    with Basel Committee rules, beginning in January 2013, we would
    be required to maintain minimum capital ratio requirements of
    6.0 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8.0 percent
    for Total capital. The proposed minimum requirement for common
    equity Tier 1 capital is 3.5 percent in 2013 and would
    increase to 4.5 percent in 2015. Basel III also
    includes three capital buffers which would be phased in over
    time and impact all three capital ratios. These buffers include
    a capital conservation buffer that would start at
    0.63 percent in 2016 and increase to 2.5 percent in
    2019. Thus, the minimum capital ratio requirements including the
    capital conservation buffer in 2019 would be 7.0 percent
    for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5 percent for
    Tier 1 capital and 10.5 percent

for Total capital. If ratios fall below the minimum requirement
    plus the capital conservation buffer, such as 10.5 percent
    for Total capital, an institution would be required to restrict
    dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses.
    Additionally, Basel III also includes a countercyclical
    buffer of up to 2.5 percent that regulators could require
    in periods of excess credit growth. The countercyclical buffer
    is to be comprised of loss-absorbing capital, such as common
    equity, and is meant to retain additional capital during periods
    of strong credit expansion, providing incremental protection in
    the event of a material market downturn. The ratios presented
    above do not include the third buffer requirement for
    systemically important financial institutions, which the Basel
    Committee continues to assess and has not yet quantified. The
    countercyclical and systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased
    in from 2013 through 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to
    begin the rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011
    and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by end of 2011 or
    early 2012.

These regulatory changes also require approval by the regulatory
    agencies of analytical models used as part of our capital
    measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more
    complex models. If these more complex models are not approved,
    it could require financial institutions to hold additional
    capital, which in some cases could be significant.

We expect to maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio in
    excess of 8 percent as the regulatory rule changes are
    implemented without needing to raise new equity capital. We have
    made the implementation and mitigation of these regulatory
    changes a strategic priority. We also note there remains
    significant uncertainty on the final impacts as the
    U.S. has issued only final rules for Basel II and a
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at this
    time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules for
    Basel III and the regulatory agencies interpret the final
    rules during the implementation process.

In addition to the capital proposals, in December 2010 the Basel
    Committee proposed two measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity
    Coverage Ratio identifies the amount of unencumbered, high
    quality liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be
    used to offset the net cash outflows the institution would
    encounter under an acute
     30-day 
    stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio measures the
    amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a
    financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the
    assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding
    liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and
    obligations, over a one-year period. These two minimum liquidity
    standards are also considered part of Basel III. The Basel
    Committee expects the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to be implemented
    in January 2015 and the Net Stable Funding Ratio to be
    implemented in January 2018, following observation periods
    beginning in 2012. We continue to monitor the development and
    potential impact of these capital proposals.

Distributions  

Our funds for cash distributions to our stockholders are derived
    from a variety of sources, including cash and temporary
    investments. The primary source of such funds, and funds used to
    pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, is dividends
    received from the Banks. Each of the Banks is subject to various
    regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of
    dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above
    regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory
    authority is authorized to determine, under certain
    circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or
    bank holding company, that the payment of dividends would be an
    unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. For
    additional information regarding the restrictions on our ability
    to receive dividends or other distributions from the Banks, see
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.

    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

In addition, the ability of Bank of America Corporation and the
    Banks to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum
    capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards
    established under FDICIA, as described above. The right of Bank
    of America Corporation, our stockholders and our creditors to
    participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our
    subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors
    of the respective subsidiaries.

For additional information regarding the requirements relating
    to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital
    requirements, see  Note 15   Shareholders 
    Equity  and  Note 18   Regulatory
    Requirements and Restrictions  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Source of
    Strength  

According to the Financial Reform Act and Federal Reserve Board
    policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a source
    of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit
    resources to support each such subsidiary. This support may be
    required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to
    provide such support. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee
    provisions of the FDICIA, in the event of a loss suffered or
    anticipated by the FDIC   either as a result of
    default of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance
    provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default  
    the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the
    FDIC s loss, subject to certain exceptions.

Deposit
    Insurance  

Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,
    subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the
    FDIC s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,
    FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to
    $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides
    for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing
    demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on
    December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The
    FDIC administers the DIF, and all insured depository
    institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that
    fund the DIF. The Financial Reform Act changed the methodology
    for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of
    an insured depository institution s domestic deposits to
    its total assets minus tangible capital. On February 7,
    2011 the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing revisions to
    the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The
    new regulation will be effective April 1, 2011 and will be
    reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the
    invoices for assessments due September 30, 2011. As a
    result of the new regulations, we expect to incur higher annual
    deposit insurance assessments. We have identified potential
    mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of
    development and we are not able to directly control the basis or
    the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC
    insurance or for other fees or assessment obligations imposed on
    financial institutions. Any future increases in required deposit
    insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have a
    significant adverse impact on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

The FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum
    ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the United States. The
    Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured
    depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least
    1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has
    recently adopted new regulations that establish a long-term
    target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As a result of the
    ongoing instability in the economy and the failure of other
    U.S. depository institutions, the DIF ratio is currently
    below the required targets and the FDIC has adopted a
    restoration plan that will result in

substantially higher deposit insurance assessments for all
    depository institutions over the coming years. Deposit insurance
    assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be
    impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking
    industry as a whole.

Transactions with
    Affiliates  

The U.S. Banks are subject to restrictions under federal
    law that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks
    and their non-bank affiliates. In general, the U.S. Banks
    are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions
    of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions
    involving Bank of America and its non-bank affiliates.
    Transactions between the U.S. Banks and their non-bank
    affiliates are required to be on arm s length terms.

Privacy and
    Information Security  

We are subject to many U.S., state and international laws and
    regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and
    procedures to protect the non-public confidential information of
    our customers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Banks to
    periodically disclose Bank of America s privacy policies
    and practices relating to sharing such information and enables
    retail customers to opt out of our ability to market to
    affiliates and non-affiliates under certain circumstances.

Item 1A.   

Risk
    Factors  

In the course of conducting our business operations, we are
    exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the
    financial services industry and others of which are more
    specific to our own businesses. The following discussion
    addresses some of the key risks that could affect our
    businesses, operations, and financial condition. Other factors
    that could affect our financial condition and operations are
    discussed in Forward-looking Statements in the MD A.
    However, other factors besides those discussed below or
    elsewhere in this report could also adversely affect our
    businesses, operations, and financial condition. Therefore, the
    risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of
    potential risks that we may face.

Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may
    continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the
    U.S. and international financial markets and economic
    conditions generally. 

Our businesses and results of operations are materially affected
    by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the
    United States and abroad, including factors such as the level
    and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates,
    inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment
    levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending,
    fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity
    of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of
    capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the
    financial markets, and the strength of the U.S. economy and
    the
     non-U.S. economies 
    in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these
    conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial
    businesses and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs
    and provision for credit losses, our capital levels and
    liquidity and our results of operations.

U.S. financial markets have improved from the severe
    financial crisis that dominated the domestic economy in the
    second half of 2008 and early 2009, but mortgage markets remain
    fragile. The financial crisis that gripped the European Union
    beginning in spring 2010 directly affected U.S. financial
    market behavior and the financial services industry. Any
    intensification of Europe s financial crisis or the
    inability to address the sources of future financial turmoil in
    Europe may adversely affect the U.S. and international
    financial markets and the financial services industry. Such
    adverse effect may involve declines in liquidity, loss of
    investor confidence in the financial services industry,
    disruptions in credit markets, declines in the values of many
    asset classes, reductions in home prices and increased
    unemployment.

Although the U.S. economy has continued to recover
    throughout 2010 and growth of real Gross Domestic Product
    strengthened in the second half of 2010, the elevated levels of
    unemployment and household debt, along with continued stress in
    the consumer and commercial real estate markets, pose challenges
    for domestic economic performance and the banking environment.
    Consumer spending, exports and business investment in equipment
    and software rose during 2010, and showed accelerated momentum
    in the second half of 2010, but labor markets and housing
    markets remain weak and pose risks. The sustained high
    unemployment rate and the lengthy duration of unemployment have
    directly impaired consumer finances and pose risks to the
    financial services sector. The housing market remains weak and
    the elevated levels of distressed and delinquent mortgages add a
    significant degree of risk to the mortgage market, in addition
    to risks inherent to the business of banking. The risks related
    to the distressed mortgage market may be accentuated by attempts
    to forestall foreclosure proceedings, as well as state and
    federal investigations into foreclosure practices throughout the
    financial services industry. These factors may adversely affect
    credit quality, bank lending and the general financial services
    sector.

These conditions, as well as any further challenges stemming
    from the continuing global economic recovery and recent
    financial reform initiatives, such as the Financial Reform Act,
    could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and
    results of operations in the future.

For additional information about economic conditions and
    challenges discussed above, see Executive Summary  
    2010 Economic and Business Environment in the MD A
    beginning on page 25.

Liquidity
    Risk  

Liquidity Risk is
    the Potential Inability to Meet Our Contractual and Contingent
    Financial Obligations, on- or Off-Balance Sheet, as they Become
    Due.  

Adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit
    ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on our
    liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, financial condition
    and results of operations by significantly limiting our access
    to the funding or capital markets, increasing our borrowing
    costs, or triggering additional collateral or funding
    requirements under certain bilateral provisions of our trading
    and collateralized financing contracts. 

Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly
    impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may
    be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in
    certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain
    transactions including OTC derivatives. Credit ratings and
    outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our
    obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term
    borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including
    asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing
    review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to
    time based on a number of factors, including our own financial
    strength and operations as well as factors not under our
    control, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks
    for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to
    revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the
    financial services industry generally.

There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current
    ratings. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the
    ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely
    have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to
    credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on
    certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where
    counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In connection with
    certain
     over-the-counter 
    (OTC) derivatives contracts and other trading agreements,
    counterparties may require us to provide additional collateral
    or to terminate these contracts and agreements and collateral
    financing arrangements in the event of a credit ratings
    downgrade. Termination of these contracts and agreements could
    cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring
    us to make significant cash payments or securities movements. If
    Bank of America Corporation s or Bank of America,
    N.A. s commercial paper or short-term credit ratings (which
    currently have the following ratings:
     P-1  by
    Moody s,
     A-1  by
    S P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more
    levels, the potential loss of short-term funding sources such as
    commercial paper or repurchase agreement financing and the
    effect on our incremental cost of funds would be material.

The ratings agencies have indicated that, as a systemically
    important financial institution, our credit ratings currently
    reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive
    significant support from the U.S. government. All three
    major ratings agencies, however, have indicated they will
    reevaluate and could reduce the uplift they include in our
    ratings for government support for reasons arising from
    financial services regulatory reform proposals or legislation.
    In February 2010, S P affirmed our current credit ratings
    but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on its
    belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government
    would be willing to provide extraordinary support. On
    July 27, 2010, Moody s affirmed our current ratings
    but revised the outlook to negative from stable due to its
    expectation for lower levels of government support over time as
    a result of the passage of the Financial Reform Act. Also, on
    October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit ratings on Rating
    Watch Negative from stable outlook due to proposed rulemaking
    that could negatively impact its assessment of future systemic
    government

    of America 2010

support. Any expectation that government support may be
    diminished or withheld in the future would likely have a
    negative impact on the company s credit ratings. The timing
    of the agencies  assessment of potential government
    support, as well as its impact on our ratings, is currently
    uncertain.

For additional information about the company s credit
    ratings, see Liquidity Risk     Credit
    Ratings in the MD A beginning on page 70.

Our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of
    operations, and competitive position may be significantly
    adversely affected if we are unable to access capital markets,
    continue to raise deposits, sell assets on favorable terms, or
    if there is an increase in our borrowing costs. 

Liquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets
    primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities,
    as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the
    capital markets. We rely on certain unsecured and secured
    funding sources, such as the commercial paper and repo markets,
    which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature.
    We also engage in asset securitization transactions to fund
    consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be
    significantly adversely affected by an inability to access the
    capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital
    markets; unforeseen outflows of cash, including customer
    deposits, funding for commitments and contingencies; inability
    to sell assets on favorable terms; or negative perceptions about
    our short- or long-term business prospects, including changes in
    our credit ratings. Several of these factors may arise due to
    circumstances beyond our control, such as a general market
    disruption, negative views about the financial services industry
    generally, changes in the regulatory environment, actions by
    credit ratings agencies or an operational problem that affects
    third parties or us. For example, during the recent financial
    crisis our ability to raise funding was at times adversely
    affected in the U.S. and international markets.

Our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing
    market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Credit spreads
    are the amount in excess of the interest rate of
    U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of
    the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers.
    Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can
    significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our
    credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by
    market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest
    rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be
    unpredictable and highly volatile.

For additional information about our liquidity position and
    other liquidity matters, including credit ratings and outlooks
    and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity
    risks, see Capital Management and Liquidity Risk in the
    MD A beginning on pages 63 and 67, respectively.

Bank of America Corporation is a holding company and as such
    we are dependent upon our subsidiaries for liquidity, including
    our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. 

Bank of America Corporation is a separate and distinct legal
    entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. We evaluate
    and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity
    liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and
    other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one
    legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another,
    including Bank of America Corporation. For instance, Bank of
    America Corporation depends on dividends, distributions and
    other payments from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries to
    fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock
    and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including
    debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank
    and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that
    restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to
    block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
    Bank of America Corporation. In addition, our bank and
    broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their
    ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum
    regulatory capital requirements, as well as restrictions on
    their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or
    brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Additional
    restrictions on

related-party transactions, increased capital requirements and
    additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or
    brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the
    amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Bank of
    America Corporation and even require Bank of America Corporation
    to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Regulatory
    action of that kind could impede access to funds we need to make
    payments on our obligations or dividend payments. In addition,
    our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a
    subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to
    the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. For a
    further discussion regarding our ability to pay dividends, see
     Note 15   Shareholders  Equity  and
     Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and
    Restrictions  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mortgage
    and Housing Market-Related Risk  

We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to
    repurchase loans
     and/or 
    reimburse the GSEs and monoline bond insurance companies
    (monolines) for losses due to claims related to representations
    and warranties made in connection with mortgage-backed
    securities and other loans, and have received similar claims,
    and may receive additional claims, from whole loan purchasers
    and private-label securitization investors. The resolution of
    these claims could have a material adverse effect on our cash
    flows, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We have securitized and continue to securitize first-lien
    mortgage loans generally in the form of mortgage-backed
    securities (MBS) guaranteed by the GSEs or, in the case of
    Federal Housing Administration insured and U.S. Department
    of Veterans Affairs guaranteed mortgage loans, by the Government
    National Mortgage Association. We and our legacy companies and
    certain subsidiaries have also sold pools of first-lien
    mortgages and home equity loans as private-label securitizations
    or in the form of whole loans. In certain cases, all or a
    portion of the private-label MBS were insured by monolines or
    other non-GSE counterparties. In connection with these
    securitizations and other transactions, we or our subsidiaries
    or legacy companies made various representations and warranties.
    Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in a
    requirement that we repurchase mortgage loans, or indemnify or
    provide other remedies to counterparties.

On December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with Freddie Mac
    (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), collectively the GSEs, where the
    Corporation paid $2.8 billion to resolve repurchase claims
    involving first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to
    the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide
    (Countrywide). The agreement with FHLMC extinguishes all
    outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole
    claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling
    representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by
    legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain
    exceptions we do not believe will be material. The agreement
    with FNMA substantially resolves the existing pipeline of
    repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of
    September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of
    selling representations and warranties related to loans sold
    directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with
    the GSEs do not cover outstanding and potential mortgage
    repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged
    breaches of selling representations and warranties to legacy
    Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold
    directly to the GSEs, loans sold to the GSEs other than
    described above, loan servicing obligations, other contractual
    obligations or loans contained in private-label securitizations.
    In addition, we have other unresolved representation and
    warranty claims from the GSEs and certain monolines, and other
    non-GSE counterparties, and certain monolines have instituted
    litigation against us with respect to representations and
    warranties claims.

We have experienced increasing repurchase and similar requests
    from non-GSE counterparties, including monolines, private-label
    MBS securitization investors and whole loan purchasers. We
    expect additional activity in this

Bank of America
    2010        9  

Table of Contents   

area going forward and the volume of repurchase requests from
    monolines, whole loan purchasers and investors in private-label
    MBS could increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that
    future losses may occur and our estimate is that the upper range
    of loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7.0 billion to
    $10.0 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does
    not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available
    information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions
    that are subject to change. A significant portion of this
    estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide,
    and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the
    original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss
    or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different
    from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices
    and other matters and may vary by counterparty. We expect that
    the resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE
    counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and we will
    vigorously contest any request for repurchase if we conclude
    that a valid basis for the repurchase claim does not exist.

The resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these
    representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows
    and results of operations, and could exceed existing estimates
    and accruals. In addition, any accruals or estimates we have
    made are based on assumptions which are subject to change.

    warranties exposure and past activities, see Recent
    Events   Representations and Warrants Liability, in

    Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters, in

Continued, or increasing, declines in the domestic and
    international housing markets, including home prices, may
    adversely affect the company s consumer and commercial
    portfolios and have a significant adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations. 

Economic deterioration throughout 2009 and weakness in the
    economic recovery in 2010 was accompanied by continued stress in
    the U.S. and international housing markets, including
    declines in home prices. These declines in the housing market,
    with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, have
    negatively impacted the demand for many of our products and the
    credit performance of our consumer and commercial portfolios.
    Additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally
    influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt
    outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market,
    which has declined due to reduced activity in the housing
    market. Continued high unemployment rates in the U.S. have
    added another element to the financial challenges facing
    U.S. consumers and further compounded these stresses in the
    U.S. housing market as employment conditions may be
    compelling some consumers to delay new home purchases or miss
    payments on existing mortgages.

Conditions in the housing market have also resulted in
    significant write-downs of asset values in several asset
    classes, notably mortgage-backed securities and exposure to
    monolines. These conditions may negatively affect the value of
    real estate which could negatively affect our exposure to
    representations and warranties. While there were continued
    indications throughout the past year that the U.S. economy
    is stabilizing, the performance of our overall consumer and
    commercial portfolios may not significantly improve in the near
    future. A protracted continuation or worsening of these
    difficult housing market conditions would likely exacerbate the
    adverse effects outlined above and have a significant adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We temporarily suspended our foreclosure sales nationally in
    the fourth quarter of 2010 to conduct an assessment of our
    foreclosure processes. Subsequently, numerous state and federal
    investigations of foreclosure  

processes across our industry have been initiated. Those
    investigations and any irregularities that might be found in our
    foreclosure processes, along with any remedial steps taken in
    response to governmental investigations or to our own internal
    assessment, could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations. 

On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking
    residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in
    states where foreclosure requires a court order following a
    legal proceeding (judicial states). On October 8, 2010, we
    stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an
    assessment of the related business processes. These actions
    generally did not affect the initiation and processing of
    foreclosures prior to judgment or sale of vacant real estate
    owned properties. We took these precautionary steps in order to
    ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the
    appropriate controls and quality assurance. Our review has
    involved an assessment of the foreclosure process, including a
    review of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending
    proceedings.

As a result of that review, we identified and implemented
    process and control enhancements, and we intend to monitor
    ongoing quality results of each process. After these
    enhancements were put in place, we resumed foreclosure sales in
    most states where foreclosures are handled without judicial
    supervision (non-judicial states) during the fourth quarter of
    2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining non-judicial
    states in the first quarter of 2011. We also commenced a rolling
    process of preparing, as necessary, affidavits of indebtedness
    in pending foreclosure proceedings in order to resume the
    process of taking these foreclosure proceedings to judgment in
    judicial states, beginning with properties believed to be
    vacant, and with properties for which the mortgage was
    originated on a non-owner-occupied basis. The process of
    preparing affidavits in pending proceedings is expected to
    continue in the first quarter of 2011, and could result in
    prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure
    sales.

Law enforcement authorities in all 50 states and the
    U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies,
    including certain bank supervisory authorities, continue to
    investigate alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices
    of residential mortgage servicers. Authorities have publicly
    stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond
    foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan
    modification and loss mitigation practices. The Corporation is
    cooperating with these investigations and is dedicating
    significant resources to address these issues. The current
    environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential
    to subject the Corporation to inquiries or investigations that
    could significantly adversely affect its reputation. Such
    investigations by state and federal authorities, as well as any
    other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure
    processes, could result in material fines, penalties, equitable
    remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process
    changes), or other enforcement actions, and result in
    significant legal costs in responding to governmental
    investigations and additional litigation.

While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the temporary
    delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a
    result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously
    completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to
    additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental
    and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current
    foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our
    pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged
    irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure
    activities. Our costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2010
    and we expect that additional costs incurred in connection with
    our foreclosure process assessment will continue into 2011 due
    to the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure
    process assessment, to revise affidavit filings and to implement
    other operational changes. This will likely result in higher
    noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal
    expenses, in  Home Loans   Insurance . It is also
    possible that the temporary suspension of foreclosure sales may
    result in additional costs and

10        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of
    properties or possible home price declines, while foreclosures
    are delayed. In addition, required process changes could
    increase our default servicing costs over the longer term.
    Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may increase
    temporarily, which may result in an increase in non-performing
    loans and servicing advances and may impact the collectability
    of such advances and the value of our MSRs, MBS and real estate
    owned properties. An increase in the time to complete
    foreclosure sales also may inflate the amount of highly
    delinquent loans in the Corporation s mortgage statistics,
    result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans, and
    could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as
    non-performing assets rise. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure
    sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated,
    and our continued process enhancements and any issues that may
    arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process
    could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations.

Loan sales have not been materially impacted by the temporary
    delay in foreclosure sales or the review of our foreclosure
    process. However, delays in foreclosure sales could negatively
    affect the valuation of our real estate owned properties and MBS
    that are serviced by us. With respect to GSE MBS, while there
    would be no credit impairment to security holders due to the
    guarantee provided by the agencies, the valuation of certain MBS
    could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to
    changes in the timing of cash flows. The impact on GSE MBS
    depends on, among other factors, how long the underlying loans
    are affected by foreclosure delays and would vary among
    securities. With respect to non-GSE MBS, under certain scenarios
    the timing and amount of cash flows could be negatively
    affected. The ultimate impact on non-GSE MBS depends on the same
    factors that impact GSE MBS, as well as the level of credit
    enhancement, including subordination. In addition, as a result
    of our foreclosure process assessment and related control
    enhancements that we have implemented, there may continue to be
    delays in foreclosure sales, including a continued backlog of
    foreclosure proceedings, and evictions from real estate owned
    properties.

Failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer in the
    residential mortgage securitization process, including
    obligations related to residential mortgage foreclosure actions,
    along with other losses we could incur in our capacity as
    servicer, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations. 

Bank of America and its legacy companies have securitized, and
    continue to securitize, a significant portion of the residential
    mortgage loans that they have originated or acquired. The
    Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its
    subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf
    of third-party securitization vehicles. In addition to
    identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing
    arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or
    whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the
    servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the
    obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of
    prudent mortgage lenders
     and/or  to
    exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs
    when servicing loans for its own account. Many non-GSE
    residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole loan
    servicing agreements also require the servicer to indemnify the
    trustee or other investor for or against failures by the
    servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or
    omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith, or gross
    negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the
    servicer s duties.

Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs
    with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in
    servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each
    GSE typically has the right to demand

that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the seller s
    representations and warranties made in connection with the
    initial sale of the loans, even if the servicer was not the
    seller. The GSEs also reserve the contractual right to demand
    indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing
    breaches. In addition, our agreements with the GSEs and their
    first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to
    resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation,
    if necessary.

With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure
    process-related activities referred to above, a servicer may
    incur costs or losses if the servicer elects or is required to
    re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in its
    capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed
    foreclosures. The servicer also may incur costs or losses if the
    validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If
    a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or
    deficiencies in the foreclosure process, the servicer may have
    liability to a title insurer of the property sold in
    foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be reimbursable
    to the servicer. A servicer may also incur costs or losses
    associated with private-label securitizations or other loan
    investors relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in
    processing documents necessary to comply with state law
    governing foreclosures.

The servicer may be subject to deductions by insurers for
    mortgage insurance or guarantee benefits relating to delays or
    alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if the servicer commits a
    material breach of its servicing obligations that is not cured
    within specified timeframes, including those related to default
    servicing and foreclosure, it could be terminated as servicer
    under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of
    these actions may harm the servicer s reputation, increase
    its servicing costs or otherwise adversely affect its financial
    condition and results of operations.

Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often
    required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce
    mortgages loans. There has been significant public commentary
    regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in
    the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.
    (MERS), as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether
    securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to
    them and have valid liens securing those loans. We currently use
    the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential
    mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been
    sold to investors or securitization trusts. Additionally,
    certain legal challenges have been made to the process for
    transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts, asserting
    that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the
    holder of the mortgage note could  break the chain of
    title  and cloud the ownership of the loan. In order to
    foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be
    necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be
    made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage
    held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed
    by MERS. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of
    mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain
    required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of
    MERS is found not to be effective, we could be obligated to cure
    certain defects or in some circumstances be subject to
    additional costs and expenses, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We may also face negative reputational costs from these
    servicing risks, which could reduce our future business
    opportunities in this area or cause that business to be on less
    favorable terms to us.

For additional information concerning our servicing risks, see
    Recent Events   Certain Servicing-related Issues, in
    the MD A beginning on page 34.

Credit
    Risk  

Credit Risk is
    the Risk of Loss Arising from a Borrower, Obligor or
    Counterparty Default when a Borrower, Obligor or Counterparty
    does not Meet its Obligations.  

Increased credit risk, due to economic or market disruptions,
    insufficient credit loss reserves or concentration of credit
    risk, may necessitate increased provisions for credit losses and
    could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. 

When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter
    of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit
    risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their
    loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the
    terms of their agreements. A number of our products expose us to
    credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments,
    derivatives, trading account assets and assets
     held-for-sale. 
    As one of the nation s largest lenders, the credit quality
    of our consumer and commercial portfolios has a significant
    impact on our earnings.

Although credit quality generally continued to show improvement
    throughout 2010, net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, leases
    and foreclosed properties remained elevated. Global and national
    economic conditions continue to weigh on our credit portfolios.
    Economic or market disruptions are likely to increase our credit
    exposure to customers, obligors or other counterparties due to
    the increased risk that they may default on their obligations to
    us. These potential increases in delinquencies and default rates
    could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity,
    consumer real estate and purchased credit-impaired portfolios,
    through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.
    In addition, this increased credit risk could also adversely
    affect our commercial loan portfolios where we have experienced
    continued losses, particularly in our commercial real estate
    portfolios, reflecting broad-based stress across industries,
    property types and borrowers.

We estimate and establish an allowance for credit risks and
    credit losses inherent in our lending activities (including
    unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair
    value, through a charge to earnings. The amount of allowance is
    determined based on our evaluation of the potential credit
    losses included within our loan portfolio. The process for
    determining the amount of the allowance, which is critical to
    our operating results and financial condition, requires
    difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts
    of economic conditions and how our borrowers will react to those
    conditions. Our ability to assess future economic conditions or
    the creditworthiness of our customers, obligors or other
    counterparties is imperfect. The ability of our borrowers to
    repay their loans will likely be impacted by changes in economic
    conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our
    forecasts. As with any such assessments, there is also the
    chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that
    we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that
    we identify. In addition, we may underestimate the credit losses
    in our loan portfolios and suffer unexpected losses if the
    models and approaches we use to establish reserves and make
    judgments in extending credit to our borrowers and other
    counterparties become less predictive of future behaviors,
    valuations, assumptions or estimates. Although we believe that
    our allowance for credit losses was in compliance with
    applicable standards at December 31, 2010, there is no
    guarantee that it will be sufficient to address future credit
    losses, particularly if economic conditions worsen. In such an
    event we may need to increase the

size of our allowance in 2011, which would adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations.

In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject
    to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry,
    country, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in
    the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or
    a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity
    or group of entities could have a material adverse impact on our
    businesses, and the processes by which we set limits and monitor
    the level of our credit exposure to individual entities,
    industries and countries may not function as we have
    anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different
    industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high
    volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial
    services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial
    banks, investment funds and insurers. This has resulted in
    significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.

In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into
    transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and
    U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political
    conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency
    fluctuations, social instability and changes in government
    policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of
    sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities
    and expose us to credit risk.

We also have a concentration of credit risk with respect to our
    consumer real estate, consumer credit card and commercial real
    estate portfolios, which represent a large percentage of our
    overall credit portfolio. The economic downturn has adversely
    affected these portfolios and further exposed us to this
    concentration of risk. Continued economic weakness or
    deterioration in real estate values or household incomes could
    result in materially higher credit losses.

For additional information about our credit risk and credit risk
    management policies and procedures, see Credit Risk Management
    in the MD A beginning on page 71 and
     Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting
    Principles  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We could suffer losses as a result of the actions of or
    deterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties
    and other financial services institutions. 

Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding
    transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and
    commercial soundness of other market participants. We have
    exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we
    routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the
    financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,
    commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and
    other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and
    other counterparties are inter-related because of trading,
    funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults
    by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial
    services institutions, or the financial services industry
    generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could
    lead to significant future liquidity problems, including losses
    or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these
    transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of
    a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be
    impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is
    liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount
    of the loan or derivatives exposure due us. Any such losses
    could materially adversely affect our financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks
    and potential losses. 

We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions,
    including credit derivatives. Our derivatives businesses may
    expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks
    that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses and have an
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated
    credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause
    previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice
    versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately
    taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of
    a derivative instrument.

Many derivative instruments are individually negotiated and
    non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or
    settling some positions difficult. Many derivatives require that
    we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or
    other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of
    cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the
    underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause
    us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or
    result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and
    operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.

Derivatives contracts and other transactions entered into with
    third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or
    settled on a timely basis. While a transaction remains
    unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to
    heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of
    default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract. In
    addition, as new and more complex derivatives products have been
    created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other
    instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying
    contracts may arise, which could impair our ability to
    effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and
    subject us to increased costs.

For a further discussion of our derivatives exposure, see
     Note 4   Derivatives  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Market
    Risk  

Market Risk is
    the Risk that Values of Assets and Liabilities or Revenues will
    be Adversely Affected by Changes in Market Conditions Such as
    Market Volatility. Market Risk is Inherent in the Financial
    Instruments Associated with our Operations and Activities,
    Including Loans, Deposits, Securities, Short-Term Borrowings,
    Long-Term Debt, Trading Account Assets and Liabilities, and
    Derivatives.  

Our businesses and results of operations have been, and may
    continue to be, significantly adversely affected by changes in
    the levels of market volatility and by other financial or
    capital market conditions. 

Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely
    affected by market risk factors such as changes in interest and
    currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied
    volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic
    and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect,
    for example, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet
    securities, trading assets, other financial instruments, and
    MSRs, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to
    credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management,
    which could reduce our fee income relating to those assets,
    (iv) customer allocation of capital among investment
    alternatives, (v) the volume of client activity in our
    trading operations, and (vi) the general profitability and
    risk level of the transactions in which we engage. Any of these
    developments could have a significant adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We use various models and strategies to assess and control our
    market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent
    limitations. For example, our models, which rely on historical
    trends and assumptions, may not be sufficiently predictive of
    future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or
    unanticipated market movements and illiquidity, especially
    during severe market downturns or stress events. The models that
    we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also
    reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation or lack
    thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market
    indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen
    circumstances, such as the market conditions experienced in 2008
    and 2009, previously uncorrelated indicators may become
    correlated, or previously correlated indicators may move in
    different directions. These types of market movements have at
    times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and
    have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so
    in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated
    where other market participants are using risk or trading models
    with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In
    these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk
    positions due to the activity of other market participants or
    widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where
    asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for
    certain assets. To the extent that we make investments directly
    in securities that do not have an established liquid trading
    market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or
    hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and
    therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions.

For additional information about market risk and our market risk
    management policies and procedures, see Market Risk Management
    in the MD A beginning on page 100.

Declines in the value of certain of our assets could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations. 

We have a large portfolio of financial instruments that we
    measure at fair value including, among others, certain corporate
    loans and loan commitments, loans
     held-for-sale, 
    repurchase agreements and long-term deposits. We also have
    trading account assets and liabilities, derivatives assets and
    liabilities,
     available-for-sale 
    debt and marketable equity securities, consumer-related MSRs and
    certain other assets that are valued at fair value. We determine
    the fair values of these instruments based on the fair value
    hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance. The fair values
    of these financial instruments include adjustments for market
    liquidity, credit quality and other transaction specific
    factors, where appropriate.

Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct and
    significant impact on our results of operations, unless we have
    effectively  hedged  our exposures. For example,
    changes in interest rates, among other things, can impact the
    value of our MSRs and can result in substantially higher or
    lower mortgage banking income and earnings, depending upon our
    ability to fully hedge the performance of our MSRs. Fair values
    may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or
    the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the
    continued availability of these transactions. The financial
    strength of counterparties, such as monolines, with whom we have
    economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also
    will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and
    significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially
    curtail or eliminate the trading activity for these assets,
    which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such
    assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets
    reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the
    difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted
    assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and
    increases our funding costs.

Asset values also directly impact revenues in our asset
    management businesses. We receive asset-based management fees
    based on the value of our clients  portfolios or
    investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also
    receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such
    investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of
    our clients  portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can
    result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.

For additional information about fair value measurements, see
     Note 22   Fair Value Measurements  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information
    about our asset management businesses, see Business Segment
    Operations    Global Wealth   Investment
    Management  in the MD A beginning on page 48.

Our commodities activities, particularly our physical
    commodities business, subject us to performance, environmental
    and other risks that may result in significant cost and
    liabilities. 

As part of our commodities business, we enter into
    exchange-traded contracts, financially settled OTC derivatives,
    contracts for physical delivery and contracts providing for the
    transportation, transmission
     and/or 
    storage rights on or in vessels, barges, pipelines, transmission
    lines or storage facilities. Commodity, related storage,
    transportation or other contracts expose us to the risk that the
    price of the underlying commodity or the cost of storing or
    transporting commodities may rise or fall. In addition,
    contracts relating to physical ownership
     and/or 
    delivery can expose us to numerous other risks, including
    performance and environmental risks. For example, our
    counterparties may not be able to pass changes in the price of
    commodities to their customers and therefore may not be able to
    meet their performance obligations. Our actions to mitigate the
    aforementioned risks may not prove adequate to address every
    contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks
    may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance
    recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect
    to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition
    and results of operations may be adversely affected by such
    events.

Regulatory
    and Legal Risk  

Bank regulatory agencies may require us to hold higher levels
    of regulatory capital, increase our regulatory capital ratios,
    or increase liquidity which could result in the need to issue
    additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital or to
    liquidate company assets. 

We are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by
    the Federal Reserve Board. These guidelines establish regulatory
    capital requirements for banking institutions to meet minimal
    requirements as well as to qualify as a
     well-capitalized  institution. (A
     well-capitalized  institution must generally maintain
    capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines.)
    The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by
    required leverage ratios, defined as so-called Tier 1 (the
    highest grade) capital divided by quarterly average total
    assets, after certain adjustments. If any of our insured
    depository institutions fails to maintain its status as
     well- capitalized  under the capital rules of their
    primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve Board will
    require us to enter into an agreement to bring the insured
    depository institution or institutions back into a
     well-capitalized  status. For the duration of such an
    agreement, the Federal Reserve Board may impose restrictions on
    the activities in which we may engage. If we were to fail to
    enter into such an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms
    of such agreement, the Federal Reserve Board may impose more
    severe restrictions on the activities in which we may engage,
    including requiring us to cease and desist in activities
    permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

It is possible that in the future increases in regulatory
    capital requirements, changes in how regulatory capital is
    calculated or increases to liquidity requirements, may cause the
    loss of our  well-capitalized  status unless we
    increase our capital levels by issuing additional common stock,
    thus diluting

our existing shareholders, or by selling assets. For example,
    the Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which our
    previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities
    will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective
    January 1, 2013. The exclusion of trust preferred
    securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in
    incrementally over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment
    of trust preferred securities during the phase-in period remains
    unclear and is subject to future rulemaking.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued Basel III,
    proposing a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If
    implemented by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III
    could significantly increase our capital requirements.
    Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the
    disqualification of trust preferred securities from Tier 1
    capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing that the
    disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III
    also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital
    (deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),
    investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others,
    within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of other
    comprehensive income in capital, increased capital for
    counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer
    requirements. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the
    final rulemaking processes for Basel III in early
    2011 and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by
    year-end 2011 or early 2012. In addition to the capital
    proposals, in December 2010 the Basel Committee proposed two
    measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio
    identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality liquid
    assets a financial institution holds that can be used to offset
    the net cash outflows the institution would encounter under an
    acute  30-day 
    stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio measures the
    amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a
    financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the
    assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding
    liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and
    obligations, over a one-year period. The Basel Committee expects
    the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to be implemented in January 2015
    and the Net Stable Funding Ratio to be implemented in January
    2018, following observation periods beginning in 2012.

Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital,
    regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations, as we may need to liquidate certain assets, perhaps
    on terms unfavorable to us and contrary to our business plans.
    Such a requirement could also compel us to issue additional
    securities, which could dilute our current common
    stockholders.For additional information about the proposals
    described above and their potential effect on our required
    levels of regulatory capital, see Item 1.
    Business   Capital and Operational Requirements on
    page 5 and Capital Management   Regulatory
    Capital in the MD A beginning on page 63.

Government measures to regulate the financial industry,
    including the Financial Reform Act, either individually, in
    combination or in the aggregate, could require us to change
    certain of our business practices, impose significant additional
    costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability
    to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require
    us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of
    assets that we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or
    otherwise materially and adversely affect our businesses,
    financial condition or results of operations. 

As a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the
    state, federal and international levels. As a result of the
    financial crisis and related global economic downturn that began
    in 2007, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased
    public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more
    comprehensive regulation of our financial services practices.
    These regulatory and legislative measures, either individually,
    in combination or in the aggregate, could require us to change
    certain of our business practices, impose significant additional
    costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability
    to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require
    us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of
    assets that we hold,

significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially and
    adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results
    of operations.

Throughout 2009 and 2010, several major regulatory and
    legislative initiatives were adopted that will have significant
    future impacts on our businesses and financial results. For
    example, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued
    amendments to Regulation E, which implements the Electronic
    Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on
    July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for
    existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other
    banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card
    transactions that overdraw a consumer s account unless the
    consumer affirmatively consents to the bank s payment of
    overdrafts for those transactions. In addition, in May 2009, the
    Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure
    ( CARD ) Act of 2009 was signed into law. The majority
    of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010.
    The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card
    reform related to credit card industry practices, including
    significantly restricting banks  ability to change interest
    rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk,
    changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to
    consumer credit card disclosures. Complying with the
    Regulation E amendments and the CARD Act has required us to
    invest significant management attention and resources to make
    the necessary disclosure and systems changes and has adversely
    affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our
    earnings.

In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The
    Financial Reform Act, among other reforms, (i) mandates
    that the Federal Reserve Board limit debit card interchange
    fees; (ii) bans banking organizations from engaging in
    proprietary trading and restricts their sponsorship of, or
    investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to
    limited exceptions; (iii) increases regulation of the
     over-the-counter 
    derivative markets through measures that broaden the derivative
    instruments subject to regulation, requiring clearing and
    exchange trading and imposing additional capital and margin
    requirements for derivative market participants;
    (iv) changes the assessment base used in calculating FDIC
    deposit insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets
    less tangible capital; (v) provides for heightened capital,
    liquidity, and prudential regulation and supervision over
    systemically important financial institutions;
    (vi) provides for resolution authority to establish a
    process to unwind large systemically important financial
    companies; (vii) creates a new regulatory body to set
    requirements around the terms and conditions of consumer
    financial products and expands the role of state regulators in
    enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks;
    (viii) disqualifies trust preferred securities and other
    hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital;
    (ix) includes a variety of corporate governance and
    executive compensation provisions and requirements; and
    (x) requires securitizers to retain a portion of the risk
    that would otherwise be transferred into certain securitization
    transactions.

Many of these provisions have begun to be or will be phased in
    over the next several months or years and will be subject both
    to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable
    regulatory bodies. The ultimate impact of the final rules on our
    businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory
    interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of
    our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain
    provisions. For instance, in December 2010, the Federal Reserve
    Board requested comment on a proposed rule that would establish
    debit card interchange fee standards and prohibit network
    exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The proposed
    rule would establish standards for determining whether a debit
    card interchange fee received by a card issuer is reasonable and
    proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the
    transaction. Depending upon which cap is ultimately adopted, the
    final rule could have a significant adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations and could result
    in additional goodwill impairment charges within our  Global
    Card Services  business segment.

We also anticipate that the final regulations associated with
    the Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain
    activities, including limitations on

the use of a bank s own capital for proprietary trading and
    sponsorship or investment in hedge funds and private equity
    funds (Volcker Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule
    are required to be in place by October 21, 2011, and the
    Volcker Rule becomes effective 12 months after such rules
    are final or on July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The
    Volcker Rule then gives banking entities two years from the
    effective date (with opportunities for additional extensions) to
    bring activities and investments into conformance. In
    anticipation of the adoption of the final regulations, we have
    begun winding down our proprietary trading line of business. The
    ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule or the winding down of this
    business, and the time it will take to comply or complete,
    continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations issued may
    impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.

Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to
    broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to
    regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain
    derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for
    certain market participants and imposing position limits on
    certain
     over-the-counter 
    derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the
    SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings
    by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until
    July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to
    implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these
    derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,
    continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose
    additional operational and compliance costs on us and may
    require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively
    impact our revenues and results of operations.

The Financial Reform Act provided for a new resolution authority
    to establish a process to unwind large systemically important
    financial institutions. As part of that process we will be
    required to develop and implement a recovery and resolution plan
    which will be subject to review by the FDIC and the Federal
    Reserve Board to determine whether our plan is credible and
    viable. As a result of FDIC and Federal Reserve Board review, we
    could be required to take certain actions over the next several
    years which could impose operational costs and could potentially
    result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses
    and subsidiaries.

Although we cannot predict the full effect of the Financial
    Reform Act on our operations, it, as well as the future rules
    implementing its reforms, could result in a significant loss of
    revenue, impose additional costs on us, require us to increase
    our regulatory capital or otherwise materially adversely affect
    our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Congress and the Administration have signaled
    growing interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income
    tax. While the timing of consideration of such legislative
    reform is unclear, possible approaches include lowering the 35%
    corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned
    outside of the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various
    other deductions, tax credits
     and/or  other
    tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify
    either the one-time impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets
    and liabilities that might result upon enactment of tax reform
    or the ongoing impact reform might have on income tax expense,
    but it is possible either of these impacts could adversely
    affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Other countries have also proposed and, in some cases, adopted
    certain regulatory changes targeted at financial institutions or
    that otherwise affect us. For example, the European Union has
    adopted increased capital requirements and the U.K. has
    (i) increased liquidity requirements for local financial
    institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K.
    bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well
    as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K;
    (ii) adopted a Bank Tax Levy which will apply to the
    aggregate balance sheet of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K.
    banks and banking groups operating in the U.K.;
    (iii) proposed the creation and production of recovery and
    resolution plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by U.K.
    regulated entities; and (iv) announced the expectation of
    corporate

income tax rate reductions of one percent to be enacted during
    each of 2011, 2012 and 2013 that would favorably impact income
    tax expense on future earnings but which would result in
    adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and
    related one-time charges to income tax expenses of nearly
    $400 million for each one percent reduction (however, it is
    possible that the full three percent rate reductions could be
    enacted in 2011, which would result in a 2011 charge of
    approximately $1.1 billion). We are also monitoring other
    international legislative proposals that could materially impact
    us, such as changes to income tax laws. Currently, in the U.K.,
    net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) have an indefinite
    life. Were the U.K. taxing authorities to introduce limitations
    on the future utilization of NOLs and the Corporation was unable
    to document its continued ability to fully utilize its NOLs, it
    would be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge
    to income tax expense. Depending upon the nature of the
    limitations, such a change could be material in the period of
    enactment. In addition, in 2010 the FSA issued a policy
    statement regarding payment protection insurance (PPI) that
    requires companies to review their sales practices and to
    proactively remediate certain problems, if discovered. As a
    result of this review, we may be required to record additional
    liabilities.

For additional information about the regulatory initiatives
    discussed above, see Regulatory Matters in the MD A
    beginning on page 56. For additional information about PPI,
    see  Note 14   Commitments and
    Contingencies     Payment Protection
    Insurance Claims Matter  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

During the last ten years, the Corporation and its subsidiaries
    and legacy companies have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to
    the GSEs. Each GSE is currently in a conservatorship, with its
    primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as
    conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the
    conservatorships will end, or any associated changes to the
    GSEs  business structure that could result. We also cannot
    predict whether the conservatorships will end in receivership.
    There are several proposed approaches to reform the GSEs which,
    if enacted, could change the structure of the GSEs and the
    relationship among the GSEs, the government, and the private
    markets. We expect dialogue concerning GSE reform to continue
    and additional proposals to be advanced. We cannot predict the
    prospects for the enactment, timing or content of legislative or
    rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs.
    Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the
    future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to
    exist in their current form. GSE reform, if enacted, could
    result in a significant change to the business operations of
     Home Loans   Insurance .

Finally, since the financial crisis began several years ago, an
    increasing number of bank failures has imposed significant costs
    on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the
    regulator s deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In
    order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve
    ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased,
    and may increase in the future, assessment rates of insured
    institutions, including Bank of America.

Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,
    subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the
    FDIC s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,
    FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to
    $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides
    for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing
    demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on
    December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The
    FDIC administers the DIF, and all insured depository
    institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that
    fund the DIF. The Financial Reform Act changed the methodology
    for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of
    an insured depository institution s domestic deposits to
    its total assets minus tangible capital. On February 7,
    2011 the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing revisions to
    the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The
    new regulation will be effective April 1, 2011 and will be
    reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the
    invoices for assessments due

September 30, 2011. As a result of the new regulations, we
    expect to incur higher annual deposit insurance assessments. We
    have identified potential mitigation actions, but they are in
    the early stages of development and we are not able to directly
    control the basis or the amount of premiums that we are required
    to pay for FDIC insurance or for other fees or assessment
    obligations imposed on financial institutions. Any future
    increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank
    industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We face substantial potential legal liability and significant
    regulatory action, which could have material adverse effects on
    our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations,
    or cause significant reputational harm to us. 

We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the
    volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against us and other
    financial institutions remain high and are increasing. Increased
    litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant
    regulatory action against us could have material adverse effects
    on our financial condition and results of operations or cause
    significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could
    adversely impact our business prospects. In addition, we
    continue to face increased litigation risk and regulatory
    scrutiny as a result of the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch
    acquisitions. As a result of ongoing challenging economic
    conditions and the increased level of defaults over recent
    years, we have continued to experience increased litigation and
    other disputes with counterparties regarding relative rights and
    responsibilities. These litigation and regulatory matters and
    any related settlements could have a material adverse effect on
    our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
    They could also negatively impact our reputation and lead to
    volatility of our stock price. For a further discussion of
    litigation risks, see  Note 14   Commitments
    and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policy could
    adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations. 

Our businesses and earnings are affected by domestic and
    international fiscal and monetary policy. For example, the
    Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit
    in the United States and its policies determine in large part
    our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising
    activities and the return we earn on those loans and
    investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. The
    actions of the Federal Reserve Board also can materially affect
    the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt
    securities and MSRs, and its policies also can affect our
    borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to
    repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings are also affected
    by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various
    U.S. regulatory authorities,
     non-U.S. governments 
    and international agencies. Changes in domestic and
    international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our
    control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse
    impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our
    businesses, in turn adversely impacting our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Risk
    of the Competitive Environment in which We Operate  

We face significant and increasing competition in the
    financial services industry. 

We operate in a highly competitive environment.  Over
    time, there has been substantial consolidation among companies
    in the financial services industry, and this trend accelerated
    in recent years as the credit crisis led to numerous mergers and
    asset acquisitions among industry participants and in certain
    cases reorganization, restructuring, or even bankruptcy. This
    trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and
    financial services markets. We will continue to experience
    intensified competition as further

16        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

consolidation in the financial services industry in connection
    with current market conditions may produce larger,
    better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies
    that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products
    and services at more competitive prices. To the extent we expand
    into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face
    competitors with more experience and more established
    relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants
    in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability
    to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth
    of
     e-commerce 
    have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer
    products and services that traditionally were banking products,
    and for financial institutions to compete with technology
    companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial
    solutions. Increased competition may negatively affect our
    results of operations by creating pressure to lower prices on
    our products and services and reducing market share.

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our
    businesses, including our competitive position and business
    prospects. 

Our ability to attract and retain investors, customers, clients
    and employees could be adversely affected to the extent our
    reputation is damaged. Significant harm to our reputation can
    arise from many sources, including employee misconduct,
    litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum
    standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical
    behavior, unintended disclosure of confidential information, and
    the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties.
    Actions by the financial services industry generally or by
    certain members or individuals in the industry also can
    significantly adversely affect our reputation.

Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues also
    could give rise to reputational risk that could cause
    significant harm to us and our business prospects, including
    failure to properly address operational risks. These issues
    include legal and regulatory requirements, privacy, properly
    maintaining customer and associate personal information, record
    keeping, protecting against money-laundering, sales and trading
    practices, ethical issues, and the proper identification of the
    legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent
    in our products.

We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to
    properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.
    Management of potential conflicts of interests has become
    increasingly complex as we expand our business activities
    through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests
    with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address,
    or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of
    interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with
    us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which
    could adversely affect our businesses.

We continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny
    resulting from the financial crisis, including our foreclosure
    practices, modifications of mortgages, volume of lending,
    compensation practices, our acquisitions of Countrywide and
    Merrill Lynch, and the suitability of certain trading and
    investment businesses. Failure to appropriately address any of
    these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory
    restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could,
    among other consequences, increase the size and number of
    litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to
    enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur
    related costs and expenses.

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is
    critical to the success of our businesses and failure to do so
    could adversely affect our business prospects, including our
    competitive position and results of operations. 

Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified
    personnel within the financial services industry and from
    businesses outside the financial services industry has been, and
    is expected to continue to be, intense even during difficult
    economic times. Our competitors include
     non-U.S.-based 
    institutions and institutions otherwise not subject to
    compensation and hiring regulations imposed on
    U.S. institutions and financial institutions in particular.
    The difficulty we face in competing for key personnel is
    exacerbated in emerging markets, where we

are often competing for qualified employees with entities that
    may have a significantly greater presence or more extensive
    experience in the region.

In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must
    provide market-level compensation. As a large financial and
    banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on
    compensation practices (which may or may not affect our
    competitors) by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC or other
    regulators around the world. Any future limitations on executive
    compensation imposed by legislators and regulators could
    adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified
    employees. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our annual
    bonus compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent
    years taken the form of long-term equity awards. The value of
    long-term equity awards to senior employees generally has been
    negatively affected by the significant decline in the market
    price of our common stock. If we are unable to continue to
    attract and retain qualified individuals, our business
    prospects, including our competitive position and results of
    operations, could be adversely affected.

Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving
    industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our
    businesses. 

Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses
    that provide a broad range of financial products and services,
    delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success
    depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and
    services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing
    pressure by competitors to provide products and services at
    lower prices. This can reduce our net interest margin and
    revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition,
    the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet
    services, could require us to incur substantial expenditures to
    modify or adapt our existing products and services. We might not
    be successful in developing or introducing new products and
    services, responding or adapting to changes in consumer spending
    and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products
    and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal
    customers.

Risks
    Related to Risk Management  

Our risk management framework may not be effective in
    mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant
    losses. 

Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and
    loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and
    control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are
    subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity,
    compliance, fiduciary, operational and reputational risks, among
    others. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk
    monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques are
    inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence
    or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown
    risks. For example, recent economic conditions, heightened
    legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services
    industry and increases in the overall complexity of our
    operations, among other developments, have resulted in the
    creation of a variety of previously unanticipated or unknown
    risks, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk
    monitoring and mitigation techniques. As such, we may incur
    future losses due to the development of such previously
    unanticipated or unknown risks.

For additional information about our risk management policies
    and procedures, see Managing Risk in the MD A beginning on
    page 59.

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems
    or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our
    businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information
    or damage our reputation. Any such failure also could have a
    significant adverse effect on our reputation, cash flows,
    financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process
    and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of
    transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous
    and diverse markets in many currencies. The potential for
    operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization,
    including losses resulting from unauthorized trades by any
    employees.

Bank of America

Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our
    internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties
    and the vast array of employees and key executives in our
     day-to-day 
    and ongoing operations. Our financial, accounting, data
    processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to
    operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that
    are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect
    our ability to process these transactions or provide these
    services. We must continuously update these systems to support
    our operations and growth. This updating entails significant
    costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems
    and integrating them with existing ones.

In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure,
    termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing
    agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial
    intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions.
    In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among
    clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has
    increased our exposure to operational failure, termination or
    capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries
    that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and
    cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure,
    termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among
    market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the
    risk of operational failure as disparate complex systems need to
    be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.

Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial
    institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses,
    and the increased centrality of these entities under proposed
    and potential regulation, increases the risk that an operational
    failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide
    operational failure that could adversely impact our own business
    operations. Any such failure, termination or constraint could
    adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our
    clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses
    and could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
    transmission of confidential and other information in our
    computer systems and networks. Although we take protective
    measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant,
    the security of our computer systems, software and networks may
    be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer
    viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have
    a security impact. Additionally, breaches of security may occur
    through intentional or unintentional acts by those having
    authorized or unauthorized access to our or our clients  or
    counterparties  confidential or other information. If one
    or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize
    our or our clients  or counterparties  confidential
    and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted
    through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
    interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients , our
    counterparties  or third parties  operations, which
    could result in significant losses or reputational damage to us.
    We may be required to expend significant additional resources to
    modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate
    vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and
    security risks, and we may be subject to litigation and
    financial losses that are either not insured against or not
    fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.

We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and
    proprietary information by
     e-mail  and
    other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with
    clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other
    third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities, but
    we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure
    capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service
    providers, counterparties and other third parties, and we may
    not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate
    controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the
    information. Any interception, misuse or mishandling of
    personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to
    or received from a client, vendor, service provider,
    counterparty or other third party could result in legal
    liability, regulatory action and

reputational harm for us and could have a significant adverse
    effect on our competitive position, financial condition and
    results of operations.

With regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our
    operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems
    and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be
    adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure.
    Such disruptions could involve electrical, communications,
    internet, transportation or other services used by us or third
    parties with whom we conduct business. These disruptions may
    occur as a result of events that affect only our facilities or
    those of our clients or other business partners but they could
    also be the result of events with a broader impact globally,
    regionally or in the cities where those facilities are located.
    The costs associated with such disruptions, including any loss
    of business, could have a significant adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial condition.

Any of these operational and security risks could lead to
    significant and negative consequences, including reputational
    harm as well as loss of customers and business opportunities,
    which in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our
    businesses, financial condition and results of operations. For a
    further discussion of operational risks and our operational risk
    management, see Operational Risk Management in the MD A
    beginning on page 106.

Risk
    Related to Past Acquisitions  

Any failure to successfully integrate or otherwise realize
    the expected benefits from our recent acquisitions could
    adversely affect our results of operations. 

There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with
    mergers and acquisitions. We have made several significant
    acquisitions in the last several years, including Merrill Lynch
    and Countrywide, and the success of these acquisitions faces
    numerous challenges. In particular, the success of our
    acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2009 will continue to depend, in
    part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and
    cost savings from combining the businesses of Bank of America
    and Merrill Lynch. If we are not able to successfully integrate
    these businesses, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of
    the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to
    realize than expected. For example, we may fail to realize the
    growth opportunities and cost savings anticipated to be derived
    from the acquisition. With regard to any of our acquisitions, a
    significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also
    cause us not to realize expected benefits. These failures could
    in turn negatively affect our financial condition, including
    adversely impacting the carrying value of the acquisition
    premium or goodwill. Our ability to achieve these objectives has
    also been made more difficult as a result of the substantial
    challenges that we are facing in our businesses because of the
    current economic environment.

In addition, it is possible that the integration process could
    result in disruption of our and Merrill Lynch s ongoing
    businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures
    and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain
    sufficiently strong relationships with clients, customers,
    depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits
    of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert
    management attention and resources. These integration matters
    could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period.
    We will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in
    connection with any future acquisitions or decisions to
    downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business
    mix of the Corporation.

Risk
    of Being an International Business  

We are subject to numerous political, economic, market,
    reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in
    the
     non-U.S. jurisdictions 
    in which we operate which could adversely impact our
    businesses. 

We do business throughout the world, including in developing
    regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets. Our
    businesses and revenues derived from
     non-U.S. jurisdictions 
    are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social
    or judicial instability, changes in governmental

18        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

policies or policies of central banks, expropriation,
    nationalization
     and/or 
    confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls,
    exchange controls, other restrictive actions, unfavorable
    political and diplomatic developments and changes in
    legislation. These risks are especially acute in emerging
    markets. As in the United States, many
     non-U.S. jurisdictions 
    in which we do business have been negatively impacted by
    recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions
    are showing signs of recovery, others continue to experience
    increasing levels of stress. In addition, the risk of default on
    sovereign debt in some
     non-U.S. jurisdictions 
    is increasing and could expose us to substantial losses. Any
    such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an
    adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations.

Our
     non-U.S. businesses 
    are also subject to extensive regulation by various
     non-U.S. regulators, 
    including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and
    other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those
    businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations
    applicable to the financial services and securities industries
    are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to
    determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market
    or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various
    jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local
    laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with
    regulators could have a significant and adverse effect not only
    on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation
    generally.

We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and
    governments located in
     non-U.S. jurisdictions, 
    including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of
     non-U.S. securities 
    may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above
    factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be
    magnified, because
     non-U.S. trading 
    markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are
    generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than
    U.S. trading markets.

We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats
    of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other
    governments in response
     and/or 
    military conflicts, that could adversely affect business and
    economic conditions abroad as well as in the United States.

     non-U.S. credit 
    and trading portfolio, see Credit Risk Management   
      Non-U.S. Portfolio 
    in the MD A beginning on page 94.

Risk
    from Accounting Changes  

Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or
    assumptions in the application of accounting policies could
    adversely affect our financial condition and results of
    operations. 

Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we
    record and report our financial condition and results of
    operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and
    assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or
    liabilities and results of operations and are critical because
    they require management to make difficult, subjective and
    complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
    If those assumptions, estimate or judgments were incorrectly
    made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period
    financial statements.

Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the
    accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB), the SEC, banking regulators and our independent
    registered public accounting firm) may also amend or even
    reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how
    various standards should be applied. These changes can be hard
    to predict and can materially impact how we record and report
    our financial condition and results of operations. In some
    cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard
    retroactively, resulting in the Corporation needing to revise
    and republish prior period financial statements. For a further
    discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and
    standards and recent accounting changes, see Complex Accounting
    Estimates in the MD A beginning on page 107 and

    Principles  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    that certain of our premises and facilities are no longer
    necessary for our operations. There is no assurance that we will
    be able to dispose of any such excess premises, and we may incur
    costs in connection with such disposition, including costs that
    could be material to our results of operations in any given
    period.

    U.K.; future risk-weighted assets and any mitigation efforts to
    reduce risk-weighted assets; net interest income; credit trends
    and conditions, including credit losses, credit reserves,

    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (GAAP) and with the requirements of
    various regulatory agencies, including our ability to comply

    U.S. regulators without raising additional capital; the
    revenue impact of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility
    and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act); the revenue impact
    resulting from, and any mitigation actions taken in response to,

    long-term debt levels; run-off of loan portfolios; the impact of
    various legal proceedings discussed in  Litigation and

    number of delayed foreclosure sales and the resulting financial
    impact and other similar matters; and other matters relating to
    the Corporation and the securities that we may offer from time
    to time. The foregoing is not an exclusive list of all
    forward-looking statements the Corporation makes. These
    statements are not guarantees of future results or performance
    and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that
    are difficult to predict and often are beyond the
    Corporation s control. Actual outcomes and results may
    differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the
    Corporation s forward-looking statements.

2010 Economic and
    Business Environment  

The banking environment and markets in which we conduct our
    businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by
    developments in the U.S. and global economies, as well as
    the continued implementation and rulemaking from recent
    financial reforms. The global economy continued to recover in
    2010, but growth was very uneven across countries and regions.
    Emerging nations, led by China, India and Brazil, expanded
    rapidly, while the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan continued to
    grow modestly.

United
    States  

In the U.S., the economy began to recover early in 2010, fueled
    by moderate growth in consumption and inventory rebuilding, but
    slowed in late spring, coincident with the intensification of
    Europe s financial crisis. A slowdown in consumption and
    domestic demand growth contributed to weak employment gains and
    an unemployment rate that drifted close to 10 percent.
     Year-over-year 
    inflation measures receded below one percent and stock market
    indices declined. Concerns about high unemployment and fears
    that the U.S. might incur deflation led the Federal Reserve
    to adopt a second round of quantitative easing that involved
    purchases of $600 billion of U.S. Treasury securities
    scheduled to occur through June 2011. The announcement of this
    policy led to lower interest rates. Bond yields rebounded in the
    second half of 2010 as the U.S. economy reaccelerated,
    driven by stronger consumer spending, rapid growth of exports
    and business investment in equipment and software. The strong
    holiday retail season provided healthy economic momentum toward
    year end. Despite only moderate economic growth in 2010,
    corporate profits rose sharply, benefiting from strong
    productivity gains and constraints on hiring and operating
    costs. Cautious business financial practices resulted in a
    record-breaking $1.5 trillion in free cash flows at
    non-financial businesses.

The housing market remained weak throughout 2010. Home sales
    were soft, despite lower home prices and low interest rates.
    There were delays in the foreclosure process on the large number
    of distressed mortgages and the supply of unsold homes remained
    high. Based on available Home Price Index (HPI) information, the
    mild improvement in home prices that occurred in the second half
    of 2009 continued into early 2010. However, housing prices
    renewed a downward trend in the second half of 2010, due in part
    to the expiration of tax incentives for home buyers.

Credit quality of bank loans to businesses and households
    improved significantly in 2010 and the continued economic
    recovery improved the environment for bank lending. Bank
    commercial and industrial loans to businesses increased in the
    last few months of 2010, following their steep recession-related
    declines, reflecting increasing loan demand relating to stronger
    production, inventory building and capital spending. Rising
    disposable personal income, household deleveraging and improving
    household finances contributed to improving consumer credit
    quality.

Europe  

In Europe, a financial crisis emerged in mid-2010, triggered by
    high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign
    debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain that created
    concerns about the ability of these European Union (EU)
     peripheral nations  to continue to service their debt
    obligations. These conditions impacted financial markets and
    resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt
    of many EU nations. The financial crisis and efforts by the
    European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and
    International Monetary Fund (IMF) to negotiate a financial
    support package to financially challenged EU nations unsettled
    global financial markets and contributed to Euro exchange rate
    and interest rate volatility. Economic performance of certain EU
     core nations,  led by Germany, remained healthy
    throughout 2010, while the economies of Greece, Ireland, Italy,
    Portugal and Spain experienced recessionary conditions and
    slowing

growth in response to the financial crisis and the
    implementation of fiscal austerity programs. Additionally, Spain
    and Ireland s economies declined as a result of material
    deterioration in their housing sectors. Uncertainty over the
    outcome of the EU governments  financial support programs
    and worries about sovereign finances continued through year end.
    For information on our exposure in Europe, see
     Non-U.S. Portfolio 
    beginning on page 94 and  Note 28  
    Performance by Geographical Area  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Asia  

Asia, excluding Japan, continued to outperform all other regions
    in 2010 with strong growth across most countries. China and
    India continued to lead the region in terms of growth and China
    became the second largest economy in the world after the U.S.,
    eclipsing Japan. Growth across the region became broader based
    with consumer demand, investment activity and exports all
    performing well. Asia remained well positioned to withstand
    global shocks because of record international reserves, current
    account surpluses and reduced external leverage. Many Asian
    nations, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and
    Malaysia, are net external creditors, with China and Japan among
    the largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds. Bank balance
    sheets have improved across most of the region and asset quality
    issues have remained manageable. Among the key challenges faced
    by the region were large capital inflows that placed
    appreciation pressures on most currencies against the
    U.S. Dollar (USD), complicating monetary policy and adding
    to excess liquidity pressures. Most countries in the region,
    including China, India, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia,
    began to withdraw fiscal stimulus and tighten monetary policy
    with hikes in interest rates as growth gathered momentum and as
    food and broader price inflation pressures began to increase.
    Japan performed well early in the year, but the economy weakened
    at the end of the year due to weakening consumer demand, and
    appreciation of the yen that hurt export competitiveness. For
    information on our exposure in Asia, see
     Non-U.S. Portfolio 
    beginning on page 94 and  Note 28  
    Performance by Geographical Area  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Emerging
    Nations  

In the emerging nations, inflation pressures began to mount and
    their central banks raised interest rates or took steps to
    tighten monetary policy and slow bank lending. Strong growth in
    emerging nations and their favorable economic outlooks attracted
    capital from the industrialized nations. The excess global
    liquidity generated by the accommodative monetary policies of
    the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and other central banks also
    flowed into emerging nations. These capital inflows put upward
    pressure on many emerging nation currencies. As a result, some
    emerging nations, such as Brazil, experienced strong currency
    appreciation. However, in other nations, that peg their
    currencies to the U.S. dollar, currency appreciation was
    muted causing inflationary pressures and rapid real estate price
    appreciation. Global economic momentum, along with the generally
    weak U.S. dollar and easing monetary policies in several
    industrialized nations, contributed to rising prices for
    industrial commodities in these emerging nations. Through year
    end, inflation pressures in key emerging nations continued to
    mount. For more information on our emerging nations exposure,
    see Table 48 on page 95.

Performance
    Overview  

In 2010, we reported a net loss of $2.2 billion compared to
    net income of $6.3 billion in 2009. After preferred stock
    dividends and accretion of $1.4 billion in 2010 compared
    with $8.5 billion in 2009, net loss applicable to common
    shareholders was $3.6 billion, or $0.37 per diluted common
    share, compared to $2.2 billion, or $0.29 per diluted
    common share in 2009. Our 2010 results reflected, among other
    things, $12.4 billion in goodwill impairment charges,
    including non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment
    charges of

Bank of America
    2010        25  

Table of Contents   

$10.4 billion in  Global Card Services  and
    $2.0 billion in  Home Loans   Insurance .
    For more information about the goodwill impairment charges in
    2010, see Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on
    page 107 and  Note 10   Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Excluding the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges,
    net income was $10.2 billion for 2010. After preferred
    stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common
    shareholders, excluding the goodwill impairment charges was
    $8.8 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share, for 2010.
    Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis decreased
    $9.6 billion or eight percent to $111.4 billion in
    2010.

Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion
    to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase
    was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new
    consolidation guidance. The increase was partially offset by
    lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the
    core assets and trading assets and liabilities.

Noninterest income decreased $13.8 billion to
    $58.7 billion in 2010 compared to $72.5 billion in
    2009. Contributing to the decline was lower mortgage banking
    income, down $6.1 billion, largely due to $6.8 billion
    in representations and warranties provision, and decreases in
    equity investment income of $4.8 billion, gains on sales of
    debt securities of $2.2 billion, trading account profits of
    $2.2 billion, service charges of $1.6 billion and
    insurance income of $694 million, compared to 2009. These
    declines were partially offset by an increase in other income of
    $2.4 billion and a decrease in impairment losses of
    $1.9 billion.

Representations and warranties expense increased
    $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion in 2010 compared to
    $1.9 billion in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by
    a $4.1 billion provision for representations and warranties
    in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter provision
    includes $3.0 billion related to the impact of the
    agreements reached with the GSEs on December 31, 2010,
    pursuant to which we paid $2.8 billion to resolve
    repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgage loans
    sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy
    Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) as well as
    adjustments made to the representations and warranties liability
    for other loans sold

directly to the GSEs and not covered by these agreements. For
    more information about the GSE agreements, see Recent Events
    beginning on page 33 and  Note 9  
    Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate
    Guarantees  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to
    $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for
    credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs
    in 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves, compared with the
    2009 provision for credit losses that was $14.9 billion
    higher than net charge-offs, reflecting reserve additions
    throughout the year. The reserve reduction in 2010 was due to
    improving portfolio trends across most of the consumer and
    commercial businesses, particularly the U.S. credit card,
    consumer lending and small business products, as well as core
    commercial loan portfolios.

Noninterest expense increased $16.4 billion to
    $83.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was
    driven by the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges
    recognized in 2010. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges,
    noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion in 2010 compared
    to 2009, driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel
    costs reflecting the build-out of several businesses and a
    $1.6 billion increase in litigation expense, partially
    offset by lower merger and restructuring charges.

FTE basis, net income excluding the goodwill impairment
    charges, noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment
    charges and net income applicable to common shareholders
    excluding the goodwill impairment charges are non-GAAP measures.
    For corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures,

Deposits  net income decreased from the prior year due to
    a decline in revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net
    interest income increased as a result of a customer shift to
    more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially
    offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to
    asset and liability management (ALM) activities. The noninterest
    income decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E,
    which was effective in the third quarter of 2010 and our
    overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Noninterest
    expense increased as a higher proportion of banking center sales
    and service

costs was aligned to  Deposits  from the other segments,
    and increased litigation expenses. The increase was partially
    offset by the absence of a special Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC) assessment in 2009.

Global Card Services  net loss increased compared to the
    prior year due primarily to a $10.4 billion goodwill
    impairment charge. Revenue decreased compared to the prior year
    driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income
    primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and
    the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment
    protection

insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been asserted.
    Provision for credit losses improved due to lower delinquencies
    and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic
    environment, which resulted in reserve reductions in 2010
    compared to reserve increases in the prior year. Noninterest
    expense increased primarily due to the goodwill impairment
    charge.

Home Loans   Insurance  net loss increased in
    2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in
    representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion
    goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in
    provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio
    trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by increased
    representations and warranties provision and lower production
    volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage
    market. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to the
    goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an
    increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset
    by lower production expense and insurance losses.

Global Commercial Banking  net income increased due to
    lower credit costs. Revenue was negatively impacted by
    additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain
    retail automotive loans. Net interest income increased due to a
    growth in average deposits, partially offset by a lower net
    interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Credit
    pricing discipline offset the impact of the decline in average
    loan balances. The provision for credit losses decreased driven
    by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real
    estate portfolio.

GBAM  net income decreased driven by the absence of the
    gain in the prior year related to the contribution of our
    merchant processing business to a joint venture. Additionally,
    the decrease was driven by lower sales and trading revenue due
    to more favorable market conditions in the prior year, partially

offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and
    gains on legacy assets compared to losses in the prior year.
    Provision for credit losses declined driven by lower net
    charge-offs and reserve levels, as well as a reduction in
    reservable criticized balances. Noninterest expense increased
    driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the
    recognition of expense on a proportionately larger amount of
    prior year incentive deferrals and investments in infrastructure
    and personnel associated with further development of the
    business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge
    related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying
    value of deferred tax assets.

GWIM  net income decreased driven by higher noninterest
    expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia
    Management long-term asset management business partially offset
    by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Revenue
    increased driven by higher asset management fees and
    transactional revenue. Provision for credit losses decreased
    driven by stabilization of the portfolios and the recognition of
    a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest
    expense increased due primarily to higher revenue-related
    expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with
    further investment in the business.

All Other  net income decreased compared to the prior year
    driven primarily by decreases in net interest income and
    noninterest income, partially offset by a lower provision for
    credit losses. Revenue decreased due primarily to lower equity
    investment gains as the prior year included a gain resulting
    from the sale of a portion of our investment in China
    Construction Bank (CCB) combined with reduced gains on the sale
    of debt securities. The decrease in the provision for credit
    losses was due to improving portfolio trends in the residential
    mortgage portfolio.

Financial
    Highlights  

Net Interest
    Income  

Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion
    to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase
    was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new
    consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to
    net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset
    by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First
    Republic in 2010 and lower rates on the core assets and trading
    assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposure. The net
    interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 basis points
    (bps) to 2.78 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to
    these same factors.

Noninterest
    Income  

Table
    3   Noninterest
    Income  

Noninterest income decreased $13.8 billion to
    $58.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The following
    items highlight the significant changes.

Card income decreased $245 million due to the
    implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of
    the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income.

Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the
    impact of Regulation E, which became effective in the third
    quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes
    implemented in late 2009.

Equity investment income decreased by $4.8 billion, as net
    gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010,
    including Ita  Unibanco, MasterCard, Santander and a
    portion of our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) were
    less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain
    related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB and
    the $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment.

Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more
    favorable market conditions in the prior year and investor
    concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory
    uncertainty. Net credit valuation gains on derivative
    liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of
    $662 million for 2009.

Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an
    increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties
    provision and lower volume and margins.

Insurance income decreased $694 million due to a liability
    recorded for future claims related to payment protection
    insurance (PPI) sold in the U.K.

Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion
    driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The
    decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to
    portfolio restructuring activities.

Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. The prior
    year included a net negative fair value adjustment of
    $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net
    positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and the prior
    year

also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of
    our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Legacy
    asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were
    $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of
    $256 million in 2010.

Impairment losses recognized in earnings on
     available-for-sale 
    (AFS) debt securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting
    lower impairment write-downs on non-agency residential
    mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt
    obligations (CDOs).

Provision for
    Credit Losses  

The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to
    $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for
    credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs
    for 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves primarily due to
    improving portfolio trends throughout the year across the
    consumer and commercial businesses.

The provision for credit losses related to our consumer
    portfolio decreased $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for
    2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses related
    to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded
    lending commitments decreased $8.7 billion to
    $3.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009.

Net charge-offs totaled $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent
    of average loans and leases for 2010 compared with
    $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent for 2009. For more
    information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision
    for Credit Losses on page 96.

Noninterest
    Expense  

Table
    4   Noninterest
    Expense  

Excluding the goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion,
    noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion for 2010
    compared to 2009. The increase was driven by a $3.6 billion
    increase in personnel costs reflecting the build out of several
    businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger
    prior year incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on
    certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a
    $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases
    were partially offset by a $901 million decline in pre-tax
    merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The
    prior year included a special FDIC assessment of
    $724 million.

Income Tax
    Expense  

Income tax expense was $915 million for 2010 compared to a
    benefit of $1.9 billion for 2009. The effective tax rate
    for 2010 was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible
    goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion.

The effective tax rate for 2010 excluding goodwill impairment
    charges from pre-tax income was 8.3 percent compared to
    (44.0) percent for 2009, primarily driven by an increase in
    pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment
    charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a

28        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

$392 million charge from a U.K. law change referred to
    below and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a
    portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to
    acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to
    $650 million in 2009. For more information, see
     Note 21   Income Taxes  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

During 2010, the U.K. government enacted a tax law change
    reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective
    for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1,
    2011. This reduction favorably affects

income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us
    to re-measure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower
    tax rate. The U.K. corporate tax rate reduction resulted in an
    income tax charge of $392 million in 2010. If future rate
    reductions were to be enacted as suggested in U.K. Treasury
    announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset
    balance, a similar charge to income tax expense for each one
    percent reduction in the rate would result during each period of
    enactment. For more information, see Regulatory Matters
    beginning on page 56.

Balance
    Sheet Overview  

Table
    5   Selected
    Balance Sheet Data  

At December 31, 2010, total assets were $2.3 trillion, an
    increase of $34.7 billion, or two percent, from
    December 31, 2009. Average total assets in 2010 decreased
    $3.5 billion from 2009. At December 31, 2010, total
    liabilities were $2.0 trillion, an increase of
    $37.9 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2009.
    Average total liabilities for 2010 increased $7.9 billion
    from 2009.

Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance
    sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management
    functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid
    assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital
    while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for
    the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the
    balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation s risk
    appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of
    balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average
    and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading
    businesses. One of our key metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio,
    is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets.

Impact of
    Adopting New Consolidation Guidance  

On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new
    consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain
    former qualifying special purpose entities and VIEs that were
    not recorded on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation
    guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of
    $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from
    consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from
    consolidation of other special purpose entities including
    multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion
    in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term
    debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in
    securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the
    allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which
    relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a
    $6.2 billion charge,
     net-of-tax, 
    to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative
    effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due
    primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease
    losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other
    comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these
    assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses and
    liabilities on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet
    had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of
    operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this
    new consolidation guidance, refer to  Note 8  
    Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets  

Federal Funds
    Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to
    Resell  

Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a
    short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased
    under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer
    transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities
    for settlement. Year-end federal funds sold and securities
    borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased
    $19.7 billion and average amounts increased
    $21.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, attributable
    primarily to a favorable rate environment and increased customer
    activity.

Trading Account
    Assets  

Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income
    securities (including government and corporate debt), and equity
    and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets
    increased $12.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily
    due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance as well as the
    consolidation of a VIE late in 2010. Average trading account
    assets decreased slightly in 2010 as compared to 2009.

Debt
    Securities  

Debt securities include U.S. Treasury and agency
    securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency
    MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use
    the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate
    and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions
    that create more economically attractive returns on these
    investments. Year-end and average balances of debt securities
    increased $26.6 billion and $52.9 billion in 2010
    compared to 2009 due to agency MBS purchases. For additional
    information on AFS debt securities, see Market Risk
    Management   Securities beginning on page 103 and
     Note 5   Securities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Loans and
    Leases  

Year-end and average loans and leases increased
    $40.3 billion to $940.4 billion and $9.5 billion
    to $958.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase
    was primarily due to the impact of adopting new consolidation
    guidance partially offset by continued deleveraging by
    consumers, tighter underwriting and the elevated levels of
    liquidity of commercial clients. For a more detailed discussion
    of the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management beginning on
    page 71 and  Note 6   Outstanding Loans
    and Leases  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for
    Loan and Lease Losses  

Year-end and average allowance for loan lease losses increased
    $4.7 billion and $12.3 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009 primarily due to the $10.8 billion of reserves
    recorded on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption
    of new consolidation guidance and reserve additions in the PCI
    portfolio throughout 2010. These were partially offset by
    reserve reductions during 2010 due to the impacts of the
    improving economy. For a more detailed discussion of the
    Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, see Allowance for Loan and
    Lease Losses beginning on page 97.

All Other
    Assets  

Year-end and average other assets decreased $59.7 billion
    and $71.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily
    by the sale of strategic investments and goodwill impairment
    charges.

Liabilities  

Deposits  

Year-end and average deposits increased $18.8 billion to
    $1.0 trillion and $7.6 billion to $988.6 billion in
    2010 compared to 2009. The increase was attributable to growth
    in our noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW and money market
    accounts primarily driven by affluent, and commercial and
    corporate clients, partially offset by a decrease in time
    deposits as a result of customer shift to more liquid products.

Federal Funds
    Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to
    Repurchase  

Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on
    a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing
    transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn
    interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet.
    Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities
    loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase decreased
    $9.8 billion and $16.2 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009 primarily due to lower funding requirements.

Trading Account
    Liabilities  

Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions
    in fixed-income securities (including government and corporate
    debt), equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average
    trading account liabilities increased $6.5 billion and
    $19.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to trading
    activity in fixed-income securities.

Commercial Paper
    and Other Short-term Borrowings  

Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide a
    funding source to supplement deposits in our ALM strategy.
    Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term
    borrowings decreased $9.6 billion to $60.0 billion and
    decreased $42.1 billion to $76.7 billion in 2010
    compared to 2009 as a result of our strengthened liquidity
    position.

Long-term
    Debt  

Year-end and average long-term debt increased by
    $9.9 billion to $448.4 billion and $43.9 billion
    to $490.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increases
    were attributable to the $84.4 billion impact of new
    consolidation guidance as discussed on page 29 offset by
    maturities outpacing new issuances and the Corporation s
    strategy to reduce our long-term debt. For additional
    information on long-term debt, see  Note 13  
    Long-term Debt  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

All Other
    Liabilities  

Year-end all other liabilities increased $22.0 billion in
    2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily by adoption of new
    consolidation guidance.

Shareholders 
    Equity  

Year-end and average shareholders  equity decreased
    $3.2 billion and $11.4 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009. The decrease was driven primarily by the goodwill
    impairment charges of $12.4 billion and the impact of
    adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a
    $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings for newly
    consolidated loans partially offset by changes in accumulated
    OCI.

Cash Flows
    Overview  

The Corporation s operating assets and liabilities support
    our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash
    flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability
    to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are
    sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing
    activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and
    other short-term investments. In addition, our financing
    activities reflect cash flows related to raising customer
    deposits and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and
    common stock.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased $12.9 billion during
    2010 due to repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt
    and net purchases of AFS securities partially offset by deposit
    growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased $88.5 billion
    during 2009 which reflected our strengthened liquidity. The
    following discussion outlines the significant activities that
    impacted our cash flows during 2010 and 2009.

During 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was
    $82.6 billion compared to $129.7 billion in 2009. The
    more significant adjustments to net

income (loss) to arrive at cash provided by operating activities
    included the decreases in the provision for credit losses,
    decreases in trading and derivative assets, and in 2010, the
    goodwill impairment charges.

During 2010, net cash of $30.3 billion was used in
    investing activities primarily for net purchases of AFS debt
    securities. During 2009, net cash provided by investing
    activities was $157.9 billion, in part, from net sales, pay
    downs and maturities of AFS securities associated with our
    management of interest rate risk, and net cash received from the
    acquisition of Merrill Lynch.

During 2010, the net cash used in financing activities of
    $65.4 billion primarily reflected the net decreases in
    long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances. During
    2009, net cash used in financing activities was
    $199.6 billion reflecting the declines in commercial paper
    and other short-term borrowings due, in part to lower Federal
    Home Loan Bank (FHLB) balances as a result of our strong
    liquidity position and a decrease in long-term debt as
    maturities outpaced new issuances.

Representations
    and Warranties Liability  

On December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with Freddie
    Mac (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), collectively the GSEs, where
    the Corporation paid $2.8 billion to resolve repurchase
    claims involving first-lien residential mortgage loans sold
    directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide
    (Countrywide). The agreement with FHLMC extinguishes all
    outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole
    claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling
    representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by
    legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain
    exceptions we do not believe will be material. The agreement
    with FNMA substantially resolves the existing pipeline of
    repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of
    September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of
    selling representations and warranties related to loans sold
    directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with
    the GSEs do not cover outstanding and potential mortgage
    repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged
    breaches of selling representations and warranties to legacy
    Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold
    directly to the GSEs or other loans sold directly to the GSEs
    other than described above, loan servicing obligations, other
    contractual obligations or loans contained in private-label
    securitizations.

As a result of these agreements and associated adjustments made
    to the representations and warranties liability for other loans
    sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by the agreements, the
    Corporation recorded a provision of $3.0 billion during the
    fourth quarter of 2010. We believe that our remaining exposure
    to representations and warranties for first-lien residential
    mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for
    as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments
    to our recorded liability for representations and warranties for
    first-lien residential mortgage for loans sold directly to the
    GSEs and not covered by the agreements as discussed above. We
    believe our predictive repurchase models, utilizing our
    historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering
    current developments, including the recent agreements,
    projections of future defaults as well as certain assumptions
    regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters,
    allows us to reasonably estimate the liability for obligations
    under representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.
    However, future provisions for representations and warranties
    liability to the GSEs may be affected if actual experience is
    different from our historical experience with the GSEs or our
    projections of future defaults, and assumptions regarding
    economic conditions, home prices and other matters, that are
    incorporated in the provision calculation.

Although our experience with non-GSE claims remains limited, we
    expect additional activity in this area going forward and that
    the volume of repurchase claims from monolines, whole-loan
    investors and investors in private-label securitizations could
    increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that future
    losses may occur, and our estimate is that the upper range of
    possible loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7 billion
    to $10 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does
    not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available
    information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions
    that are subject to change. A significant portion of this
    estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide,
    and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the
    original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss
    or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different
    from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices
    and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The resolution
    of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE counterparties
    will likely be a protracted process, and we will vigorously
    contest any request for repurchase if we conclude that a valid
    basis for the repurchase claim does not exist. For additional
    information about representations and warranties, see
     Note 9   Representations and Warranties
    Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties
    beginning on page 52.

Goodwill  

In 2010, we recorded a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment
    charge in  Global Card Services  and a $2.0 billion
    goodwill impairment charge in  Home Loans  
    Insurance . These goodwill impairment charges are non-cash,
    non-tax deductible and have no impact on our reported
    Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. Our consumer and small
    business card products, including the debit card business, are
    part of an integrated platform within  Global Card
    Services . Based on the provisions of the Financial Reform
    Act which limit the interchange fees that may be charged with
    respect to electronic debit interchange, we estimate a revenue
    loss, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, of approximately
    $2.0 billion annually based on current volumes and assuming
    limited mitigation within this segment. Accordingly, we
    performed a goodwill impairment analysis during the three months
    ended September 30, 2010. This analysis indicated that the
    implied fair value of the goodwill in  Global Card Services
     was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we
    recorded a $10.4 billion charge to reduce the carrying
    value to fair value.

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we
    performed a goodwill impairment analysis for  Home
    Loans   Insurance  as it was likely that there had
    been a decline in its fair value as a result of increased
    uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation
    exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs
    including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues
    and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address
    servicing needs. This analysis indicated that the implied fair
    value of the goodwill in  Home Loans   Insurance
     was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we
    recorded a $2 billion charge to reduce the carrying value
    of goodwill in  Home Loans   Insurance .

For additional information on the goodwill impairment charges,
    see Complex Accounting Estimates   Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets beginning on page 110 and
     Note 10   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of
    Foreclosure Processes  

On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking
    residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in
    states where foreclosure requires a court order following a
    legal proceeding (judicial states). On October 8, 2010, we
    stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an
    assessment of the related business processes. These actions
    generally did not affect the initiation and processing of
    foreclosures prior to judgment, or sale of vacant real estate
    owned properties. We took these precautionary steps in order to
    ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the
    appropriate controls and quality assurance. Our review has
    involved an assessment of the foreclosure process, including a
    review of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending
    proceedings.

As a result of that review, we identified and implemented
    process and control enhancements, and we intend to monitor
    ongoing quality results of each process. The process and control
    enhancements implemented as a result of our review are intended
    to strengthen the controls related to preparation, execution and
    notarization of affidavits in judicial states and strengthen our
    oversight of lawyers in the attorney network who conduct
    foreclosure proceedings on our behalf, both in judicial states
    and in states where foreclosures are handled without judicial
    supervision (non-judicial states). This oversight includes a
    periodic review of a sample of foreclosure files maintained by
    these attorneys, and
     on-site 
    reviews of law firms in the attorney network. In addition, our
    process and control enhancements for both judicial and
    non-judicial states include strengthening the controls related
    to the preparation and execution of other foreclosure loan
    documentation, including notices of default and pre-foreclosure
    loss mitigation affidavits, as well as enhanced associate
    training. After these enhancements were put in place, we resumed
    foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the fourth
    quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining
    non-judicial states in the

Bank of America
    2010        33  

Table of Contents   

first quarter of 2011. We also commenced a rolling process of
    preparing, as necessary, affidavits of indebtedness in pending
    foreclosure proceedings in order to resume the process of taking
    these foreclosure proceedings to judgment in judicial states,
    beginning with properties believed to be vacant, and with
    properties for which the mortgage was originated on a
    non-owner-occupied basis. The process of preparing affidavits in
    pending proceedings is expected to continue in the first quarter
    of 2011, and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings
    that delay certain foreclosure sales.

Law enforcement authorities in all 50 states and the
    U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal
    agencies, including certain bank supervisory authorities,
    continue to investigate alleged irregularities in the
    foreclosure practices of residential mortgage servicers.
    Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the
    investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation
    practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss
    mitigation practices. The Corporation is cooperating with these
    investigations and is dedicating significant resources to
    address these issues. The current environment of heightened
    regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject the Corporation
    to inquiries or investigations that could significantly
    adversely affect its reputation. Such investigations by state
    and federal authorities, as well as any other governmental or
    regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes, could result
    in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including
    requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other
    enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in
    responding to governmental investigations and additional
    litigation.

While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the temporary
    delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a
    result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously
    completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to
    additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental
    and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current
    foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our
    pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged
    irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure
    activities. Our costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2010
    and we expect that additional costs incurred in connection with
    our foreclosure process assessment will continue into 2011 due
    to the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure
    process assessment, to revise affidavit filings and to implement
    other operational changes. This will likely result in higher
    noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal
    expenses, in  Home Loans   Insurance . It is also
    possible that the temporary suspension in foreclosure sales may
    result in additional costs and expenses, including costs
    associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home
    price declines while foreclosures are delayed. In addition,
    required process changes could increase our default servicing
    costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete
    foreclosure sales may increase temporarily, which may result in
    an increase in nonperforming loans and servicing advances and
    may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of
    our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, MBS and real estate
    owned properties. An increase in the time to complete
    foreclosure sales also may inflate the amount of highly
    delinquent loans in the Corporation s mortgage statistics,
    result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans, and
    could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as
    nonperforming assets increase. Accordingly, delays in
    foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently
    anticipated, our continued process enhancements and any issues
    that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure
    process could increase the costs associated with our mortgage
    operations.

Loan sales have not been materially impacted by the temporary
    delay in foreclosure sales or the review of our foreclosure
    process. However, delays in foreclosure sales could negatively
    impact the valuation of our real estate owned properties and MBS
    that are serviced by us. With respect to agency MBS, while there
    would be no credit impairment to security holders due to the
    guarantee provided by the agencies, the valuation of certain MBS
    could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to
    changes in the timing of cash flows. The impact on agency MBS
    depends on, among other factors, how

long the underlying loans are affected by foreclosure delays and
    would vary among securities. With respect to non-agency MBS,
    under certain scenarios the timing and amount of cash flows
    could be negatively affected. The ultimate impact on the
    non-agency MBS depends on the same factors that impact agency
    MBS, as well as the level of credit enhancement, including
    subordination. In addition, as a result of our foreclosure
    process assessment and related control enhancements that we have
    implemented, there may continue to be delays in foreclosure
    sales, including a continued backlog of foreclosure proceedings,
    and evictions from real estate owned properties.

Certain
    Servicing-related Issues  

The Corporation and its legacy companies have securitized, and
    continue to securitize, a significant portion of the residential
    mortgage loans that we have originated or acquired. The
    Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its
    subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf
    of third-party securitization vehicles. In addition to
    identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing
    arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or
    whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the
    servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the
    obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of
    prudent mortgage lenders
     and/or  to
    exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs
    when servicing loans for its own account. Many non-agency
    residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole loan
    servicing agreements also require the servicer to indemnify the
    trustee or other investor for or against failures by the
    servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or
    omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross
    negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the
    servicer s duties.

Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs
    with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in
    servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each
    GSE typically has the right to demand that the servicer
    repurchase loans that breach the seller s representations
    and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the
    loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs also
    reserve the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan
    repurchase for certain servicing breaches although we believe
    that repurchase or indemnification demands solely for servicing
    breaches are rare. In addition, our agreements with the GSEs and
    their first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for
    timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or
    liquidation, if necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we
    recorded an expense of $230 million for compensatory fees
    that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of
    foreclosure delays.

With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure
    process-related activities, a servicer may incur costs or losses
    if the servicer elects or is required to re-execute or re-file
    documents or take other action in its capacity as a servicer in
    connection with pending or completed foreclosures. The servicer
    also may incur costs or losses if the validity of a foreclosure
    action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn
    a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the
    foreclosure process, the servicer may have liability to a title
    insurer of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and
    liabilities may not be reimbursable to the servicer. A servicer
    may also incur costs or losses associated with private-label
    securitizations or other loan investors relating to delays or
    alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply
    with state law governing foreclosures.

The servicer may be subject to deductions by insurers for
    mortgage insurance or guarantee benefits relating to delays or
    alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if the servicer commits a
    material breach of its servicing obligations that is not cured
    within specified timeframes, including those related to default
    servicing and foreclosure, it could be terminated as servicer
    under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of
    these actions may harm the servicer s reputation, increase
    its servicing costs or otherwise adversely affect its financial
    condition and results of operations.

Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often
    required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce
    mortgage loans. We have processes in place to satisfy document
    delivery and maintenance requirements in accordance with
    securitization transaction standards. Additionally, there has
    been significant public commentary regarding the common industry
    practice of recording mortgages in the name of Mortgage
    Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee on
    behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own
    the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens
    securing those loans. We believe that the process for mortgage
    loan transfers into securitization trusts is based on a
    well-established body of law that establishes ownership of
    mortgage loans by the securitization trusts and we believe that
    we have substantially executed this process. We currently use
    the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential
    mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been
    sold to investors or securitization trusts. Although the GSEs do
    not require the use of MERS, the GSEs permit standard forms of
    mortgages and deeds of trust that use MERS and we believe that
    loans that employ these forms are considered to be properly
    documented for the GSEs  purposes. We believe that the use
    of MERS is a widespread practice in the industry. Certain legal
    challenges have been made to the process for transferring
    mortgage loans to securitization trusts asserting that having a
    mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the
    mortgage note could  break the chain of title  and
    cloud the ownership of the loan. Under the Uniform Commercial
    Code, a securitization trust or other investor should have good
    title to a mortgage loan if, among other means, either the note
    is endorsed in blank or to the named transferee and delivered to
    the holder or its designee, which may be a document custodian.
    In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it
    may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to
    be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a
    mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be
    completed by MERS. As such, our practice is to obtain
    assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting
    foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or
    defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be effective,
    we could be obligated to cure

certain defects or in some circumstances otherwise be subject to
    additional costs and expenses, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition.

Private-label
    Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters  

On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP
    (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,
    in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing
    agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations
    (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations) from investors
    purportedly owning interests in RMBS issued in the
    securitizations. The letter asserted breaches of certain loan
    servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide
    notice to the trustee and other parties to the pooling and
    servicing agreements of breaches of representations and
    warranties with respect to mortgage loans included in the
    securitization transactions. On November 4, 2010, the
    servicer responded in writing to the letter, stating among other
    things that the letter had identified no facts indicating that
    the servicer had breached any of its obligations, and asking
    that the signatories of the letter provide evidence that they
    met the minimum voting interest requirements for investor action
    contained in the relevant contracts. BAC Home Loans Servicing,
    LP and Gibbs   Bruns LLP on behalf of certain
    investors including those who signed the letter, as well as The
    Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, have agreed to a short
    extension of any time periods commenced by the letter to permit
    the parties to explore dialogue around the issues raised. There
    are a number of questions about the validity of the assertions
    set forth in the letter, including whether these purported
    investors have standing to bring these claims. The servicer
    intends to challenge the assertions in the letter and to fully
    enforce its rights under the relevant contracts.

Supplemental
    Financial Data  

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses
    (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis.
    Although these are non-GAAP measures, we believe managing the
    business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more
    accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative
    purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is
    adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent
    before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax
    expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal
    statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures
    comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and
    tax-exempt sources.

As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the
    efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest
    income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency
    ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of
    revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points
    we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual
    planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation
    and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP
    measures provides additional clarity in assessing our results.
    Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety
    of factors including maturity of the business, competitive
    environment, market factors and other items including our risk
    appetite.

We also evaluate our business based on the following ratios that
    utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average
    tangible common shareholders  equity measures our earnings
    contribution as a percentage of common shareholders  equity
    plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES) less goodwill and
    intangible assets, (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax
    liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a
    percentage of

average shareholders  equity less goodwill and intangible
    assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax
    liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common
    shareholders  equity plus any CES less goodwill and
    intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax
    liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible
    assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax
    liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total
    shareholders  equity less goodwill and intangible assets
    (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities
    divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets
    (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.
    Tangible book value per common share represents ending common
    shareholders  equity less goodwill and intangible assets
    (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities
    divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of
    common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent
    shares. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity
    (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and
    investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our
    overall growth goals.

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures
    are presented in Tables 6 and 7 and Statistical Tables XII and
    XIV. In addition, in Table 7 and Statistical Table XIV, we have
    excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of
    $12.4 billion recorded in 2010 when presenting earnings and
    diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return
    on average assets, return on average common shareholders 
    equity, return on average tangible common shareholders 
    equity and ROTE. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures.
    Statistical Tables XIII and XV provide reconciliations of these
    non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP. We
    believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional
    clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other
    companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios
    differently.

Core Net Interest

We manage core net interest income which is reported net
    interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of
    market-based activities. As discussed in the  GBAM
     business segment section beginning on page 45, we
    evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total
    market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income
    and noninterest income for  GBAM.  In addition, 2009 is
    presented on a managed basis which is adjusted for loans that we
    originated and subsequently sold into credit card
    securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest
    income and provision for credit

losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are
    compensated for servicing the securitized assets and we recorded
    servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where
    appropriate. 2010 is presented in accordance with new
    consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income,
    core average earning assets and core net interest yield on
    earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of these two
    non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis,
    is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation
    provides additional clarity in assessing our results.

Core net interest income decreased $4.6 billion to
    $48.3 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was
    driven by lower loan levels compared to managed loan levels in
    2009, and lower yields for the discretionary and credit card
    portfolios. These impacts were partially offset by lower rates
    on deposits.

Core average earning assets decreased $39.2 billion to $1.4
    trillion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily
    due to lower

commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared
    to managed consumer loan levels in 2009. The impact was
    partially offset by increased securities levels in 2010.

Core net interest yield decreased 23 bps to
    3.46 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to the factors
    noted above.

Business
    Segment Operations  

Segment
    Description and Basis of Presentation  

We report the results of our operations through six business
    segments:  Deposits, Global Card Services, Home
    Loans   Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM
     and  GWIM , with the remaining operations recorded in
     All Other . Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned
    the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the
    former  Global Banking  segment with the former  Global
    Markets  business segment to form  GBAM  and to
    reflect  Global Commercial Banking  as a standalone
    segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to current period presentation.

We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP
    methodologies and performance measures, many of which are
    discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on
    page 36. In addition, return on average tangible
    shareholders  equity for the segments is calculated as net
    income, excluding goodwill impairment charges, divided by
    average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of
    intangible assets (excluding MSRs). We begin by evaluating the
    operating results of the segments which by definition exclude
    merger and restructuring charges.

The management accounting and reporting process derives segment
    and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for
    revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses
    is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an
    activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other
    methodologies and assumptions management believes are
    appropriate to reflect the results of the business.

Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest
    income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of
    net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding
    increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect
    certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to
    determine net income. For presentation purposes, in segments
    where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which
    are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to
    match liabilities. The net interest income of the businesses
    includes the results of a funds transfer pricing

process that matches assets and liabilities with similar
    interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Net
    interest income of the business segments also includes an
    allocation of net interest income generated by our ALM
    activities.

Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk
    management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate
    contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by
    interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate
    sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not
    significantly adversely affect net interest income. Our ALM
    activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate
    based on performance. ALM activities include external product
    pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the
    effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the
    net effects of other ALM activities.

Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific
    business segment are allocated to the segments. The most
    significant of these expenses include data and item processing
    costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data
    processing costs are allocated to the segments based on
    equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the
    segments based on the volume of items processed for each
    segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions
    are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.

Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses
    using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each
    segment s credit, market, interest rate, strategic and
    operational risk components. The nature of these risks is
    discussed further beginning on page 59. We benefit from the
    diversification of risk across these components which is
    reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment.
    The total amount of average equity reflects both risk-based
    capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically
    assigned to the business segments.

For more information on selected financial information for the
    business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total
    revenue, net income (loss) and year-end total assets, see

Deposits  

n/m = not meaningful

Deposits  includes the results of consumer deposit
    activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products
    provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition,
     Deposits  includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the
    U.S., we serve approximately 57 million consumer and small
    business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast
    to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia
    utilizing our network of approximately 5,900 banking centers,
    18,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and
    mobile banking platforms.

At December 31, 2010, our active online banking customer
    base was 29.3 million subscribers compared to
    29.6 million at December 31, 2009, and our active bill
    pay users paid $304.3 billion of bills online during 2010
    compared to $302.4 billion in 2009.

Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money
    market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest-and
    interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a
    relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net
    interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning
    assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The
    revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds
    transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest
    rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits.  Deposits
     also generates fees such as account service fees,
    non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees.

Deposits  includes the net impact of migrating customers
    and their related deposit balances between  GWIM  and
     Deposits . For more information on the migration of
    customer balances, see  GWIM  beginning on page 48.

Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010 for new
    customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These
    rules partially impacted the third quarter of 2010 and fully
    impacted the fourth quarter of 2010. In late 2009, we
    implemented changes in our overdraft policies which negatively

impacted revenue. These changes were intended to help customers
    limit overdraft fees. For more information on Regulation E,
    see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56.

Net income fell $1.2 billion, or 48 percent, to
    $1.4 billion due to lower revenue and higher noninterest
    expense. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion, or
    15 percent, to $8.1 billion as a result of a customer
    shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline,
    partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation
    related to ALM activities. Average deposits increased
    $4.2 billion from a year ago due to the transfer of certain
    deposits from other client managed businesses and organic
    growth, partially offset by the expected run-off of higher-cost
    legacy Countrywide deposits.

Noninterest income fell $1.7 billion, or 26 percent,
    to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by the decline in service
    charges due to the implementation of Regulation E and the
    impact of our overdraft policy changes. The impact of
    Regulation E, which was in effect beginning in the third
    quarter and fully in effect in the fourth quarter of 2010, and
    overdraft policy changes, which were in effect for the full year
    of 2010, was a reduction in service charges during 2010 of
    approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011, the incremental
    reduction to service charges related to Regulation E and
    overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1.1
    billion, or a full-year impact of approximately
    $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation actions.

Noninterest expense increased $1.3 billion, or
    14 percent, to $10.8 billion as a result of a higher
    proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and
    service efforts being aligned to  Deposits  from the other
    consumer segments and increased litigation expenses in 2010.
    Noninterest expense includes FDIC charges of $896 million
    compared to $1.2 billion during 2009 which included a
    special FDIC assessment.

Global Card Services  provides a broad offering of
    products including U.S. consumer and business card,
    consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers
    and small businesses. We provide credit card products to
    customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. We
    offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card
    products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards
    through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe.

On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions of the
    CARD Act became effective and negatively impacted net interest
    income during 2010 due to restrictions on our ability to reprice
    credit cards based on risk and on card income due to
    restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year impact
    on revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. For more
    information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Matters beginning on
    page 56.

The Corporation reports its  Global Card Services  results
    in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new
    consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts
    on January 1, 2010. Accordingly, current year results are
    comparable to prior year results that are presented on a managed
    basis. For more information on managed basis, refer to
     Note 26   Business Segment Information  to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information
    on the new consolidation guidance, refer to Balance Sheet
    Overview   Impact of Adopting New Consolidation
    Guidance beginning on page 29 and
     Note 8   Securitizations and Other Variable
    Interest Entities  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of the Financial Reform Act, which was signed into
    law on July 21, 2010, we believe that our debit card
    revenue in  Global Card Services  will be adversely
    impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Based on 2010
    volumes, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit card
    interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial
    Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually. This
    estimate resulted in a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment
    charge for  Global Card Services . Depending on the final
    rulemaking under the Durbin Amendment, additional goodwill
    impairment may occur in  Global Card Services . For
    additional information, refer to Regulatory

Matters   Debit Interchange Fees on page 57 and
    Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107.

Global Card Services  recorded a net loss of
    $6.6 billion primarily due to the $10.4 billion
    goodwill impairment charge in 2010. Excluding this charge,
     Global Card Services  would have reported net income of
    $3.8 billion compared to a net loss of $5.3 billion in
    the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in provision for
    credit losses. Revenue decreased $3.4 billion, or
    12 percent, to $25.6 billion, driven by lower average
    loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from
    the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording
    an incremental reserve of $592 million for future payment
    protection insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been
    asserted. For more information on payment protection insurance,
    refer to  Note 14   Commitments and
    Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net interest income decreased $2.2 billion, or
    11 percent, to $17.8 billion as average loans
    decreased $35.7 billion partially offset by lower funding
    costs. The decline in average loans was due to the elevated
    level of net charge-offs and risk mitigation strategies that
    were implemented throughout the recent economic cycle.

Noninterest income decreased $1.3 billion, or
    14 percent, to $7.8 billion driven by lower card
    income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act and
    the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment
    protection insurance claims. The decrease was partially offset
    by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the
    sale of our MasterCard equity holdings.

Provision for credit losses improved $16.9 billion due to
    lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved
    economic environment. This resulted in reserve reductions of
    $7.0 billion in 2010 compared to reserve increases of
    $3.4 billion in 2009. The prior year included a reserve
    addition due to maturing securitizations which had an
    unfavorable impact on the 2009 provision expense. In addition,
    net charge-offs declined $6.5 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009.

Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion,
    noninterest expense decreased $773 million primarily driven
    by a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center
    sales and service efforts being aligned to  Deposits  from
     Global Card Services .

Home Loans   Insurance  generates revenue by
    providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and
    services to customers nationwide.  Home Loans  
    Insurance  products are available to our customers through a
    retail network of 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers
    in approximately 750 locations and a sales force offering our
    customers direct telephone and online access to our products.
    These products are also offered through our correspondent loan
    acquisition channels. On February 4, 2011, we announced
    that we are exiting the reverse mortgage origination business.
    In October 2010, we exited the first mortgage wholesale
    acquisition channel. These strategic changes were made to allow
    greater focus on our retail and correspondent channels.

Home Loans   Insurance  products include fixed
    and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase
    and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of
    credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either
    sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while
    retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships,
    or are held on our balance sheet in  All Other  for ALM
    purposes.  Home Loans   Insurance  is not
    impacted by the Corporation s first mortgage production
    retention decisions as  Home Loans   Insurance
     is compensated for the decision on a management accounting
    basis with a corresponding offset recorded in  All Other .
    Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are
    held on the  Home Loans   Insurance  balance
    sheet. In addition,  Home Loans   Insurance
     offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit
    insurance.

On February 3, 2011, we announced that we had entered into
    an agreement to sell the lender-placed and voluntary property
    and casualty insurance assets and liabilities of Balboa
    Insurance Company (Balboa) and affiliated 

entities for an upfront cash payment of approximately
    $700 million, subject to certain closing and other
    adjustments, as well as additional future payments. Balboa is a
    wholly-owned subsidiary and part of  Home Loans  
    Insurance .

Home Loans   Insurance  includes the impact of
    transferring customers and their related loan balances between
     GWIM  and  Home Loans   Insurance  based on
    client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the
    migration of customer balances, see  GWIM  beginning on
    page 48.

Home Loans   Insurance  recorded a net loss of
    $8.9 billion compared to a net loss of $3.9 billion in
    2009 primarily due to an increase of $4.9 billion in
    representations and warranties provision and the
    $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2010,
    partially offset by a decline in provision for credit losses of
    $2.8 billion. For additional information on representations
    and warranties, see  Note 9   Representations
    and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and
    Warranties on page 52.

Provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to
    $8.5 billion driven by improving portfolio trends which led
    to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the
    Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio.

Noninterest expense increased $3.5 billion primarily due to
    the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and
    default-related and other loss mitigation expenses, partially
    offset by lower production expense and insurance losses.

Mortgage Banking
    Income  

Home Loans   Insurance  mortgage banking income
    is categorized into production and servicing income. Production
    income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and
    losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)
    and loans
     held-for-sale 
    (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs
    related to representations and warranties in the sales
    transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales
    of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes
    revenue, which is eliminated in  All Other,  for transfers
    of mortgage loans from  Home Loans   Insurance
     to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation s
    mortgage production retention decisions.

Servicing income includes income earned in connection with
    servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of
    economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our
    servicing activities are included in noninterest expense.

Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal,
    interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer
    draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting
    principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments
    to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of
    our servicing activities, along with responding to customer
    inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property
    dispositions. In an effort to avoid foreclosure, Bank of America
    evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sale
    which has resulted in elongated default timelines. Our servicing
    agreements with certain loan investors require us to comply with
    usual and customary standards in the liquidation of delinquent
    mortgage loans. Our agreements with the GSEs provide timelines
    to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances
    where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide
    the GSEs with the option to assess compensatory fees. In 2010,
    the Corporation recorded an expense of approximately
    $230 million for estimated compensatory fees that it
    expects to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure
    delays. Additionally, we may face demands and claims from
    private-label securitization investors concerning alleged
    breaches of customary servicing standards. For additional
    information on our servicing activities, see Recent
    Events   Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on
    page 34.

On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP
    (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,
    in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing
    agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations
    (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations). The letter
    asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations. For
    additional information, see Recent Events  
    Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters on

The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking
    income.

Includes sale of MSRs.

(3)   

Includes the effect of transfers of

The production loss of $688 million represented a decrease
    of $6.2 billion as representations and warranties provision
    increased $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion which includes
    provision of $3.0 billion related to the GSE agreements as
    well as adjustments to the representations and warranties
    liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not
    covered by those agreements. Also contributing to the
    representations and warranties provision for the year was our
    continued evaluation of non-GSE exposure to repurchases and
    similar claims, which led to the determination that we have
    developed sufficient repurchase experience with certain non-GSE
    counterparties to record a liability related to existing and
    future projected claims from such counterparties. For additional
    information on representations and warranties, see
     Note 9   Representations and Warranties
    Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, Recent Events   Representations
    and Warranties Liability on page 33 and Representations and
    Warranties beginning on page 52. In addition, core
    production revenue, which excludes representations and
    warranties provision, declined $1.3 billion due to a
    decline in volume driven by a drop in the overall size of the
    mortgage market and a decline in market share.

Net servicing income remained relatively flat as lower MSR
    results, net of hedges, were offset by a lower impact of
    customer payments and higher fee income. For additional
    information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see
    Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 106.

    mortgage and home equity loan production is primarily in
     GWIM. 

(2)   

Servicing of residential mortgage
    loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and
    discontinued real estate mortgage loans.

First mortgage production in  Home Loans   Insurance
     was $287.2 billion in 2010 compared to
    $354.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $67.3 billion
    was primarily due to a drop in the overall size of the mortgage
    market driven by weaker market demand for both refinance and
    purchase transactions combined with a decrease in market share.
    Home equity production was $7.6 billion in 2010 compared to
    $10.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $2.9 billion
    was primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for
    home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer
    demand.

At December 31, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was
    $14.9 billion, which represented 92 bps of the related
    unpaid principal balance compared to $19.5 billion, or
    113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at
    December 31, 2009. The decrease in the consumer MSR balance
    was driven by the impact of declining mortgage rates partially
    offset by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with
    sales of loans. In addition, elevated servicing costs, due to
    higher personnel expenses associated with default-related
    servicing activities, reduced expected cash flows. These factors
    together resulted in the 21 bps decrease in capitalized
    MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced.

Global Commercial Banking  provides a wide range of
    lending-related products and services, integrated working
    capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our
    network of offices and client relationship teams along with
    various product partners. Our clients include business banking
    and middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and
    governments, and are generally defined as companies with annual
    sales up to $2 billion. Our lending products and services
    include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate
    lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Our
    capital management and treasury solutions include treasury
    management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.

Global Commercial Banking  recorded 2010 net income
    of $3.2 billion compared to a 2009 net loss of
    $290 million, with the improvement driven by lower credit
    costs.

Net interest income remained relatively flat as growth in
    average deposits from our existing clients of
    $18.7 billion, or 14 percent, was offset by a lower
    net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. In
    addition, net interest income benefited from credit pricing
    discipline, which negated the impact of the $25.8 billion,
    or 11 percent, decline in average loan balances.

Noninterest income decreased $270 million, or nine percent,
    largely due to additional costs related to our agreement to
    purchase certain retail automotive loans. For further
    information, see  Note 14   Commitments
    and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to
    $2.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was
    driven by improvements primarily in the commercial real estate
    portfolios reflecting stabilizing values and in the

U.S. commercial portfolio resulting from improved borrower
    credit profiles. Additionally, all other portfolios experienced
    lower net charge-offs attributable to more stable economic
    conditions.

Global Commercial
    Banking Revenue  

Global Commercial Banking  revenues can also be
    categorized as treasury services revenue primarily from capital
    and treasury management, and business lending revenue derived
    from credit related products and services. Treasury services
    revenue for 2010 was $4.3 billion, an increase of
    $62 million compared to 2009. Revenue growth was driven by
    net interest income from increased deposits, partially offset by
    lower treasury service charges. As clients manage through
    current economic conditions, we have seen usage of certain
    treasury services decline and increased conversion of paper to
    electronic services. These actions combined with our clients
    leveraging compensating balances to offset fees have decreased
    treasury service charges. Business lending revenue for 2010 was
    $6.6 billion, a decrease of $299 million compared to
    2009, largely due to additional costs related to our agreement
    to purchase certain retail automotive loans. Despite client
    deleveraging in the first half of 2010 and continued low loan
    demand, commercial and industrial loan balances began to
    stabilize and show moderate growth during the latter part of
    2010. Commercial real estate loan balances declined due to
    continued client deleveraging and our management of
    nonperforming loans. Credit pricing discipline negated the
    impact of the decline in average loan balances on net interest
    income.

Global
    Banking   Markets  

GBAM  provides financial products, advisory services,
    financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services
    globally to our institutional investor clients in support of
    their investing and trading activities. We also work with our
    commercial and corporate clients to provide debt and equity
    underwriting and distribution capabilities, merger-related and
    other advisory services, and risk management products using
    interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity
    derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related
    products. As a result of our market-making activities in these
    products, we may be required to manage positions in government
    securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and
    high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS and
    asset-backed securities (ABS). Underwriting debt and equity
    issuances, securities research and certain market-based
    activities are executed through our global broker/dealer
    affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries.
     GBAM  is a leader in the global distribution of
    fixed-income, currency and energy commodity products and
    derivatives.  GBAM  also has one of the largest equity
    trading operations in the world and is a leader in the
    origination and distribution of equity and equity-related
    products. Our corporate banking services provide a wide range of
    lending-related products and services, integrated working
    capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our
    network of offices and client relationship teams along with
    various product partners. Our corporate clients are generally
    defined as companies with annual sales greater than
    $2 billion.

GBAM  also includes the results of our merchant processing
    joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.

In 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First
    Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America
    Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment
    solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check
    and
     e-commerce 
    payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate
    and commercial clients worldwide. In addition to Bank of America
    and First Data, the remaining stake was initially held by a
    third party. During 2010, the third party sold its interest to
    the joint venture, thus increasing the Corporation s
    ownership interest in the joint venture to 49 percent. For
    additional information on the joint venture agreement, see
     Note 5   Securities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net income decreased $3.7 billion to $6.3 billion due
    to a $4.1 billion decline in revenues and an increase in
    noninterest expenses of $2.1 billion. This was partially
    offset by lower provision expense reflecting improvement in
    borrower credit profiles. Additionally, income tax expense was
    negatively affected from a change in the U.K. corporate income
    tax rate that impacted the carrying value of the deferred tax
    asset by approximately $390 million.

Net interest income decreased $1.6 billion to
    $8.0 billion due to tighter spreads on trading related
    assets and lower average loan and lease balances, partially
    offset by higher earned spreads on deposits. The
    $12.2 billion, or 11 percent, decline in average loans
    and leases was driven by reduced client demand. Net interest
    income is comprised of both markets-based revenue

Bank of America

from our trading activities and banking-based revenue which is
    related to our credit and treasury service products.

Noninterest income decreased $2.6 billion due in part to
    the prior year gain of $3.8 billion related to the
    contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint
    venture. While overall sales and trading revenue were flat
     year-over-year, 
    the market in 2009 was more favorable but results were muted by
    losses on legacy positions. Noninterest expense increased
    $2.1 billion driven mainly by higher compensation costs
    from investments in infrastructure, professional fees and
    litigations expense.

    Global Banking   Markets  

Sales and Trading
    Revenue  

Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income
    including investment and non-investment grade corporate debt
    obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), RMBS
    and CDOs; currencies including interest rate and foreign
    exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures,
    forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from
    equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

Sales and trading revenue decreased $322 million, or two
    percent, to $17.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to
    increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market
    conditions in the prior year. We recorded net credit spread
    gains on derivative liabilities during 2010 of $242 million
    compared to losses of $801 million in 2009.

FICC revenue increased $435 million to $13.2 billion
    due to significantly lower market disruption charges, partially
    offset by lower revenue in our rates and currencies, commodities
    and credit products due to diminished client activity and
    European debt deterioration. Gains on legacy assets, primarily
    in trading account profits (losses) and other income (loss),
    were $321 million for 2010 compared to write-downs of
    $3.8 billion in 2009. Legacy losses in the prior year were
    primarily driven by our CMBS, CDO and leveraged finance exposure.

Equity income was $4.1 billion in 2010 compared to
    $4.9 billion in 2009 driven by a decline in client flows
    and market conditions in the derivatives business.

Investment
    Banking Income  

Product specialists within  GBAM  underwrite and distribute
    debt and equity issuances and certain other loan products, and
    provide advisory services. To provide a complete discussion of
    our consolidated investment banking income, the table below
    presents total investment banking income for the Corporation of
    which, 93 percent in 2010 and 94 percent in 2009 is
    recorded in  GBAM  with the remainder reported in  GWIM
     and  Global Commercial Banking. 

(1)   

Advisory includes fees on debt and
    equity advisory services and mergers and acquisitions.

(2)   

Represents the offset to fees paid
    on the Corporation s transactions.

Equity issuance fees decreased $465 million in 2010
    primarily reflecting lower levels of industry-wide activity and
    a decline in market-based revenue pools. Debt issuance fees
    increased $143 million consistent with a five percent
    increase in global fee pools in 2010. Strong performance within
    debt issuance was mainly driven by higher revenues within
    leveraged finance. Advisory fees decreased $148 million
    during 2010.

Global Corporate
    Banking  

Client relationship teams along with product partners work with
    our customers to provide them with a wide range of
    lending-related products and services, integrated working
    capital management and treasury solutions through the
    Corporation s global network of offices. Global Corporate
    Banking lending revenues of $3.4 billion for 2010 increased
    $567 million compared to 2009. The increase in 2010 is
    primarily due to higher fees and the negative impact of hedge
    results in 2009. Treasury services revenue of $2.8 billion
    for 2010 decreased $3.9 billion primarily due to a
    $3.8 billion pre-tax gain in the prior year related to the
    contribution of the merchant processing business to a joint
    venture. Equity investment income from the joint venture was
    $133 million for 2010. During 2010, we sold our trust
    administration business and in connection with the sale provided
    certain commitments to the acquirer. See
     Note 14     Commitments and Contingencies
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information.

Collateralized
    Debt Obligation Exposure  

CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities
    and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including
    commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our
    CDO-related exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded
    super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior
    exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts),
    warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information
    on our CDO positions, see  Note 8  
    Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure
    represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes
    that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments
    benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by
    the CDO vehicles.

In 2010, we incurred $573 million of losses resulting from
    our CDO-related exposure compared to $2.2 billion in
    CDO-related losses in 2009. This included $357 million in
    2010 related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure
    compared to $910 million in 2009. Also included in these
    losses were
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment (OTTI) write-downs of $251 million in 2010
    compared to losses of $1.2 billion in 2009 related to CDOs
    and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities.

As presented in the table below, at December 31, 2010, our
    hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before
    consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was
    $2.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion at
    December 31, 2009.

Super Senior
    Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure   

(1)   

Classified as subprime when
    subprime consumer real estate loans make up at least
    35 percent of the original net exposure value of the
    underlying collateral.

(2)   

Includes highly-rated
    collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure.

(3)   

Hedged amounts are presented at
    carrying value before consideration of the insurance.

We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to
    model the specific collateral composition and cash flow
    structure of each deal. Key inputs to the models are prepayment
    rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type,
    and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses
    recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and
    retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate decreased
    $382 million during 2010 to $466 million at
    December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, total super senior exposure of
    $2.0 billion was marked at 18 percent, including
    $156 million of retained positions from

liquidated CDOs marked at 42 percent, $527 million of
    non-subprime exposure marked at 39 percent and the
    remaining $1.3 billion of subprime exposure marked at
    14 percent of the original exposure amounts.

The table below presents our original total notional,
     mark-to-market 
    receivable and credit valuation adjustment for credit default
    swaps and other positions with monolines. The receivable for
    super senior CDOs reflects hedge gains recorded from inception
    of the contracts in connection with write-downs on the super
    senior CDOs in the table above.

Credit Default
    Swaps with Monoline Financial Guarantors   

Total monoline exposure, net of credit valuation adjustments,
    decreased $1.2 billion during 2010. This decrease was
    driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and
    terminated monoline contracts.

Other CDO
    Exposure  

With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a
    carrying value of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2010
    that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs.
    Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower

for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair
    value of the collateral. The loan, which is recorded in  All
    Other , has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled
    payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under
    the loan are customary events of default, including failure to
    pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity.
    Collateral for the loan is excluded from our CDO exposure
    discussions and the applicable tables.

GWIM  consists of three primary businesses:  Merrill
    Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM), U.S. Trust, Bank of
    America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust)  and
     Retirement Services .

MLGWM s  advisory business provides a high-touch
    client experience through a network of approximately 15,500
    financial advisors focused on clients with more than $250,000 in
    total investable assets.  MLGWM  also includes Merrill
    Edge, a new integrated investing and banking service which is
    targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in total assets.
    Merrill Edge provides team-based investment advice and guidance,
    brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform
    and key banking capabilities including access to the
    Corporation s branch network and ATMs. In addition,
     MLGWM  includes the Private Banking  
    Investments Group.

U.S. Trust , together with  MLGWM s
     Private Banking   Investments Group, provides
    comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted at wealthy
    and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than
    $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet
    clients  wealth structuring, investment management, trust
    and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.

Retirement Services  partners with financial advisors to
    provide institutional and personal retirement solutions
    including investment management,

administration, recordkeeping and custodial services for 401(k),
    pension, profit-sharing, equity award and non-qualified deferred
    compensation plans . Retirement Services  also provides
    comprehensive investment advisory services to individuals, small
    to large corporations and pension plans. Included in
     Retirement Services   results is the consolidation of
    a collective investment fund that did not have a significant
    impact on our consolidated results. For additional information,
    see  Note 8   Securitizations and Other
    Variable Interest Entities  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

GWIM  results also include the BofA Global Capital
    Management (BACM) business, which is comprised primarily of the
    cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of
    America retained following the sale of the Columbia Management
    long-term asset management business on May 1, 2010. The
    historical results of Columbia Management s long-term asset
    management business were transferred to  All Other  along
    with the Corporation s economic ownership interest in
    BlackRock.

Revenue from  MLGWM  was $13.1 billion, up four
    percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from
     U.S. Trust  was $2.7 billion, up five percent in
    2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from  Retirement Services
     was $950 million, up four percent compared to 2009.

GWIM  results include the impact of migrating clients and
    their related deposit and loan balances to or from
     Deposits ,  Home Loans   Insurance  and the
    ALM portfolio as presented in the table below. The directional
    shift of total deposits migrated was mainly due to client
    segmentation threshold changes. Subsequent to the date of
    migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest
    income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to
    which the clients migrated.

Migration
    Summary   

Net income decreased $369 million, or 22 percent, to
    $1.3 billion driven in part by higher noninterest expense,
    the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management
    long-term asset management business and lower net interest
    income, partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower
    credit costs. Net interest income decreased $157 million,
    or three percent, to $5.8 billion as the positive impact of
    higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from
    corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased
    $691 million, or seven percent, to $10.8 billion
    primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger
    markets, continued long-term assets under management flows and
    higher transactional activity. Provision for credit losses
    decreased $415 million, or 39 percent, to
    $646 million driven by stabilization of the portfolios and
    the recognition of a single large

commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased
    $1.2 billion, or 10 percent, to $13.6 billion driven
    by increases in revenue-related expenses, higher support costs
    and personnel costs associated with further investment in the
    business.

Client
    Balances  

The table below presents client balances which consist of assets
    under management, client brokerage assets, assets in custody,
    client deposits, and loans and leases.

Client
    Balances by Type   

(1)   

Client brokerage assets include
    non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets.

2009 balance includes the Columbia
    Management long-term asset management business representing
    $114.6 billion, net of eliminations, which was sold on
    May 1, 2010.

The decrease in client balances was due to the sale of the
    Columbia Management long-term asset management business,
    outflows in  MLGWM s  non-fee based brokerage assets
    and outflows in BACM s money market assets due to the
    continued low rate environment, partially offset by higher
    market levels and inflows in client deposits, long-term assets
    under management (AUM) and fee-based brokerage assets.

In 2010, the $2.7 billion Corporate Investments equity
    securities portfolio, which consisted of highly liquid
    publicly-traded equity securities, was sold as a result of a
    change in our investment portfolio objectives shifting more to
    interest earnings and reducing our exposure to equity market
    risk, which contributed to the $293 million loss in 2010.

Global Principal Investments (GPI) is comprised of a diversified
    portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and
    other alternative investments. These investments are made either
    directly in a company or held through a fund with related income
    recorded in equity investment income. GPI had unfunded equity
    commitments of $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, related to certain of these
    investments. During 2010, we sold our exposure of
    $2.9 billion in certain private equity funds, comprised of
    $1.5 billion in funded exposure and $1.4 billion in
    unfunded commitments in these funds as we continue to reduce our
    equity exposure.

Affiliates of the Corporation may, from time to time, act as
    general partner, fund manager
     and/or 
    investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate
    private equity funds. In this capacity, these affiliates manage
     and/or 
    provide investment advisory services to such real estate private
    equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party
    institutional and private clients. These activities, which are
    recorded in GPI, inherently involve risk to us and to the fund
    investors, and in certain situations may result in losses. In
    2010, we recorded a loss of $163 million related to a
    consolidated real estate private equity fund for which we were
    the general partner and investment advisor. In late 2010, the
    general partner and investment advisor responsibilities were
    transferred to an independent third-party asset manager.

Strategic Investments includes primarily our investment in CCB
    of $19.7 billion as well as our $2.6 billion remaining
    investment in BlackRock. At December 31, 2010, we owned
    approximately 10 percent, or 25.6 billion common
    shares of CCB. During 2010, we sold certain rights related to
    our investment in CCB resulting in a gain of $432 million.
    Also during 2010, we sold our Ita  Unibanco and Santander
    equity investments resulting in a net gain of approximately
    $800 million and a portion of our interest in BlackRock
    resulting in a gain of $91 million.

All Other  reported net income of $1.1 billion in
    2010 compared to $1.3 billion in 2009 with the decline due
    to decreases in net interest income and noninterest income
    compared to the prior year. The decrease in net interest income
    was driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on
    certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises
    occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the
    businesses. Noninterest income decreased $4.9 billion, as
    the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from
    sales of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on
    net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net
    negative fair value adjustments of $4.9 billion on
    structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive
    adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation
    adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI.
    Also in 2010, we sold our investments in Ita  Unibanco and
    Santander resulting in a net gain of

approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and
    BlackRock. For more information on the sales of these
    investments, see  Note 5   Securities  to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Provision for credit losses decreased $3.4 billion to
    $4.6 billion due to improving portfolio trends in the
    residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further
    deterioration in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired
    discontinued real estate portfolio.

The income tax benefit in 2010 was $4.1 billion compared to
    $2.4 billion in 2009, driven by an increase in the pre-tax
    loss as well as the release of a higher portion of a deferred
    tax asset valuation allowance.

During 2010, we completed the sale of First Republic at book
    value and as a result, we removed $17.4 billion of loans
    and $17.8 billion of deposits from the Corporation s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt
    and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of
    business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we
    commit to future purchases of products or services from
    unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding
    agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services
    with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or
    variable price over a specified period of time are defined as
    purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are
    commitments to purchase loans of $2.6 billion and vendor
    contracts of $7.1 billion. The most significant vendor
    contracts include communication services, processing services
    and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our
    contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension
    Plans,
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and
    Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on
    the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance
    of the Plans  assets and any participant contributions, if

Representations
    and Warranties  

We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in
    the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs or the Government National
    Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of the Federal Housing
    Administration (FHA) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, in prior
    years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools
    of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans
    as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans.
    In connection with these transactions, we or our subsidiaries or
    legacy companies make or have made various representations and
    warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may
    result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to
    otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a
     whole-loan 
    buyer or securitization trust (collectively, repurchase claims).
    Our operations are currently structured to attempt to limit the
    risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking
    to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with
    our underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages
    consistent with our contractual obligations.

The fair value of probable losses to be absorbed under the
    representations and warranties obligations and the guarantees is
    recorded as an accrued liability when the loans are sold. The
    liability for probable losses is updated by accruing a
    representations and warranties provision in mortgage banking
    income. This is done throughout the life of the loan as
    necessary when additional relevant information becomes
    available. The methodology used to estimate the liability for
    representations and warranties is a function of the
    representations and warranties given and considers a variety of
    factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual
    defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience,
    estimated home prices, estimated probability that a repurchase
    request will be received, number of payments made by the
    borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan
    will be required to be repurchased. Historical experience also
    considers recent events such as the agreements with the GSEs on
    December 31, 2010 as discussed in the following section. Changes
    to any one of these factors could significantly impact the
    estimate of our liability. Given that these factors vary by
    counterparty, we analyze our representations and warranties
    obligations based on the specific counterparty with whom the
    sale was made. Although the timing and volume has varied, we
    have experienced in recent periods increasing repurchase and
    similar requests from buyers and insurers, including monolines.
    Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the
    FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not
    significant because the requests are limited in number and are
    typically resolved quickly. We expect that efforts to attempt to
    assert repurchase requests by monolines,
     whole-loan 
    investors and private-label securitization investors may
    increase in the future. See Recent Events  
    Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters, on
    page 35 for additional information. We perform a
     loan-by-loan 
    review of all properly presented repurchase claims and have and
    will continue to contest such demands that we do not believe are
    valid. In addition, we may reach a bulk settlement with a
    counterparty (in lieu of the
     loan-by-loan 
    review process), on terms determined to be advantageous to the
    Corporation. Overall, disputes with respect to repurchase claims
    have increased with monoline insurers,
     whole-loan 
    buyers and
     private-label 
    securitization investors. For additional information, see
     Note 9   Representations and Warranties
    Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2010, our total unresolved repurchase
    claims totaled approximately $10.7 billion compared to
    $7.6 billion at the end of 2009. The liability for
    representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, is
    included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the
    related provision is included in mortgage banking income. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the liability was
    $5.4 billion and $3.5 billion. For 2010 and 2009, the
    provision for representations and warranties and corporate
    guarantees was $6.8 billion and $1.9 billion. The
    representations and warranties provision of $6.8 billion,
    includes a provision of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter
    of 2010 related to the GSE agreements as well as adjustments to
    the representations and warranties liability for other loans
    sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements.
    Also contributing to the increase in representations and
    warranties provision for the year was our continued evaluation
    of exposure to non-GSE repurchases and similar claims, which led
    to the determination that we have developed sufficient
    repurchase experience with certain non-GSE counterparties to
    record a liability related to existing and future projected
    claims from such counterparties. Representations and warranties
    provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology
    used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on
    the level and type of repurchase claims presented, defects
    identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase claims
    and other relevant facts and circumstances, which could have a
    material adverse impact on our earnings for any particular
    period.

Government-sponsored
    Enterprises  

During the last ten years, Bank of America and our subsidiaries
    have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to the GSEs and we have an
    established history of working with them on repurchase claims.
    Our experience with them continues to evolve and any disputes
    are generally related to areas such as the reasonableness of
    stated income, occupancy and undisclosed liabilities, and are
    typically focused on the 2004 through 2008 vintages. On
    December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with the GSEs and
    paid $2.8 billion to the GSEs pursuant to such agreements,
    resolving repurchase claims involving certain residential
    mortgage loans sold directly to them by entities related to
    legacy Countrywide. As a result of these agreements, as well as
    adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for
    other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those
    agreements, we adjusted our liability for representations and
    warranties. For additional information regarding these
    agreements, see  Note 9   Representations and
    Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our current repurchase claims experience with the GSEs is
    predominantly concentrated in the 2004 through 2008 origination
    vintages where we believe that our exposure to representations
    and warranties liability is most significant. Our repurchase
    claims experience related to loans originated prior to 2004 has
    not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our
    operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure
    after 2008. The cumulative repurchase claims for 2007 exceed all
    other vintages. The volume of loans originated in 2007 was
    significantly higher than any other vintage which, together with
    the high delinquency level in this vintage, helps to explain the
    high level of repurchase claims compared to the other vintages.

Exposure at default (EAD)
    represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of default
    or the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2010.

Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately $1.1
    trillion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 to the GSEs.
    As of December 31, 2010, slightly less than 10 percent
    of the loans in these vintages have defaulted or are
    180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). At least
    25 payments have been made on approximately 55 percent of
    severely delinquent or defaulted loans. Through
    December 31, 2010, we have received approximately
    $21.6 billion in repurchase claims associated with these
    vintages, representing approximately two percent of the loans
    sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Including the agreement
    reached with FNMA on December 31, 2010, we have resolved
    $18.2 billion of these claims with a net loss experience of
    approximately 27 percent. The claims resolved and the loss
    rate do not include $839 million in claims extinguished as
    a result of the

agreement with FHLMC due to the global nature of the agreement
    and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the
    agreement amount between current and future claims. Our
    collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases has
    averaged approximately 45 to 55 percent. Although the level
    of repurchase claims from the GSEs has been elevated for the
    last few quarters, the agreements with the GSEs have resulted in
    a decrease in the total number of outstanding repurchase claims
    at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.
    Based on the information derived from the historical GSE
    experience, including the GSE agreements discussed on the
    previous  page, we believe we are 70 percent to
    75 percent through the receipt of the GSE repurchase claims
    that we ultimately expect to receive.

The table below highlights our experience with the GSEs related
    to loans originated from 2004 through 2008.

Our liability for obligations under representations and
    warranties given to the GSEs considers the recent agreements and
    their impact on the repurchase rates on future repurchase claims
    we might receive on loans that have defaulted or that we
    estimate will default. We believe that our remaining exposure to
    representations and warranties for loans sold directly to the
    GSEs has been accounted for as a result of these agreements and
    the associated adjustments to our recorded liability for
    representations and warranties for other loans sold directly to
    the GSEs and not covered by the agreements. We believe our
    predictive repurchase models, utilizing our historical
    repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering current
    developments, including the recent agreements, projections of
    future defaults as well as certain assumptions regarding
    economic conditions, home prices and other matters, allows us to
    reasonably estimate the liability for obligations under
    representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.
    However, future provisions and possible loss or range of loss
    associated with representations and warranties made to the GSEs
    may be impacted if actual results are different from our
    assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other
    matters.

Transactions with
    Investors Other than Government-sponsored Entities  

In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have
    sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as
    private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. The
    loans sold include prime loans, including loans with a loan
    balance in excess of the conforming loan limit, Alt-A,
    pay-option, home equity and subprime loans. Many of the loans
    sold in the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with
    other mortgages into private-label securitizations issued or
    sponsored by the third-party buyer of the whole loans. In some
    of the private-label securitizations, monolines have insured all
    or some of the issued bonds or certificates. In connection with
    these securitizations and whole loan sales, we or our
    subsidiaries or our legacy companies made various
    representations and warranties. Breaches of these
    representations and warranties may result in the requirement to
    repurchase mortgage loans from or to otherwise make whole or
    provide other remedy to a whole-loan buyer or securitization
    trust.

As detailed in Table 11, legacy companies and certain
    subsidiaries sold loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with a
    principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than
    GSEs, of which approximately $478 billion in

principal has been paid and $216 billion have defaulted, or
    are severely delinquent (i.e., 180 days or more past due)
    and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010.
    As of December 31, 2010, we had received $13.7 billion
    of repurchase claims on these
     2004-2008 
    loan vintages, of which $6.0 billion have been resolved and
    $7.7 billion remain outstanding. Of the $7.7 billion
    of repurchase claims that remain outstanding, we have reviewed
    $4.1 billion that we have declined to repurchase. We have
    recognized losses of $1.7 billion on the resolved
    repurchase claims, $631 million of which relates to
    monolines and $1.1 billion of which relates to whole loan
    and private-label investors, as described in more detail below.

As it relates to private investors, including those who have
    invested in private-label securitizations, a contractual
    liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if
    counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations
    and warranties that materially and adversely affects the
    interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization
    trust, or that there is a breach of other standards established
    by the terms of the related sale agreement. We believe that the
    longer a loan performs, the less likely an underwriting
    representations and warranties breach would have had a material
    impact on the loan s performance or that a breach even
    exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population
    would have made a significant amount of payments if they are not
    yet 180 days or more delinquent, we believe that the
    principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase requests
    in this population of private-label investors is a combination
    of loans that have already defaulted and those that are
    currently 180 days or more past due. Additionally, the
    obligation to repurchase mortgage loans also requires that
    counterparties have the contractual right to demand repurchase
    of the loans. Based on a recent court ruling that dismissed a
    case against legacy Countrywide, we believe private-label
    securitization investors must generally aggregate
    25 percent of the voting interests in each of the tranches
    of a particular securitization to instruct the securitization
    trustee to investigate potential repurchase claims. While a
    securitization trustee may elect to investigate or demand
    repurchase of loans on its own, individual investors typically
    have limited rights under the contracts to present repurchase
    claims directly. Also, the motivation of some private-label
    securitization investors to assert repurchase claims may be
    diminished by the fact that their investment is not materially
    impacted by the losses due to the credit enhancement coverage
    provided by cash flows from the tranches rated below AAA, for
    example.

Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline
    are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in
    accordance with the terms of the

54        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

governing securitization documents, which may include use by the
    securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances
    or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that
    a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it
    will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust,
    the likelihood of receiving a repurchase request from a monoline
    may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no
    benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some
    monolines are not

currently performing their obligations under the financial
    guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain
    circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims.

Table 11 details the population of loans sold as whole-loans or
    in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together
    with the principal at-risk stratified by the number of payments
    the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely
    delinquent.

Excludes transactions sponsored by
    Bank of America and Merrill Lynch where no representations or
    warranties were assumed.

(3)   

Includes exposures on third-party
    sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 22 percent of
    the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated from 2004 to
    2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. As shown in
    Table 11, at least 25 payments have been made on approximately
    58 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. We
    believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations
    have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like
    the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high
    unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the
    likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was
    the cause of the loan s default.

We believe the agreements for private-label securitizations
    generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties
    and generally impose higher burdens on investors seeking loan
    repurchases than the comparable agreements with the GSEs. For
    example, borrower fraud representations and warranties were
    generally not given in private-label securitizations. The
    following represent some of the typical private-label
    securitization transaction terms (which differ substantially
    from those provided in GSE transactions):

Representation of material compliance with underwriting
    guidelines (which often explicitly permit exceptions).

Few transactions contain a representation that there has been no
    fraud or material misrepresentation by a borrower or third party.

Many representations include materiality qualifiers.

Breach of representation must materially and adversely affect
    certificate holders  interest in the loan.

No representation that the mortgage is of investment quality.

Offering documents included extensive disclosures, including
    detailed risk factors, description of underwriting practices and
    guidelines, and loan attributes.

Only parties to a pooling and servicing agreement (e.g., the
    trustee) can bring repurchase claims. Certificate holders cannot
    bring claims directly and do not have access to loan files. At
    least 25 percent of each tranche of certificate holders is
    generally required in order to direct a trustee to review

loan files for potential claims. In addition, certificate
    holders must bear costs of a trustee s loan file review.

Repurchase liability is generally limited to the seller.

These factors lead us to believe that only a portion of the
    principal at-risk with respect to loans included in
    private-label securitizations will be the subject of a
    repurchase request and only a portion of those requests would
    ultimately result in a repurchase. Although our experience with
    non-GSE claims remains limited, we expect additional activity in
    this area going forward and that the volume of repurchase claims
    from monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in
    private-label securitizations could increase in the future. It
    is reasonably possible that future losses may occur, and our
    estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to
    non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over
    existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable
    loss, is based on currently available information, significant
    judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to
    change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans
    originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase
    liability is generally limited to the original seller of the
    loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may
    be impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions
    regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters and
    may vary by counterparty. The resolution of the repurchase
    claims process with the non-GSE counterparties will likely be a
    protracted process, and we will vigorously contest any request
    for repurchase if we conclude that a valid basis for the
    repurchase claim does not exist.

The following discussion provides more detailed information
    related to non-GSE counterparties.

Monoline
    Insurers  

Legacy companies have sold $185.6 billion of loans
    originated from 2004 through 2008 into monoline-insured
    securitizations, which are included in Table 11, including
    $106.2 billion of first-lien mortgages and
    $79.4 billion of

Bank of America
    2010        55  

Table of Contents   

second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, $45.8 billion of
    the first-lien mortgages and $48.5 billion of the
    second-lien mortgages have paid off and $32.9 billion of
    the first-lien mortgages and $14.5 billion of the
    second-lien mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent
    and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010.
    At least 25 payments have been made on approximately
    52 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. Of
    the first-lien mortgages sold, $41.0 billion, or
    39 percent, were sold as whole loans to other institutions
    which subsequently included these loans with those of other
    originators in private-label securitization transactions in
    which the monolines typically insured one or more securities.
    Through December 31, 2010, we have received
    $5.6 billion of representations and warranties claims
    related to the monoline-insured transactions. Of these
    repurchase claims, $799 million have been resolved, with
    losses of $631 million. The majority of these resolved
    claims related to second-lien mortgages and $678 million of
    these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification
    while $121 million were rescinded by the investor or paid
    in full. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance
    of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase requests was
    $4.8 billion, including $3.0 billion that have been
    reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been
    identified which would constitute an actionable breach of
    representations and warranties and $1.8 billion that are in
    the process of review. We have had limited experience with most
    of the monoline insurers in the repurchase process, which has
    constrained our ability to resolve the open claims with such
    counterparties. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted
    litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which
    limits our relationship with such monoline insurers and ability
    to enter into constructive dialogue to resolve the open claims.
    It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate future
    repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom
    we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no
    liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines,
    other than a liability for repurchase requests that are in the
    process of review and repurchase requests where we have
    determined that there are valid loan defects. However, certain
    other monoline insurers have engaged with us in a consistent
    repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a
    liability related to existing and projected future claims from
    such counterparties.

Whole Loan Sales
    and Private-label Securitizations  

Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold
    loans in whole loan sales or via private-label securitizations
    with a total principal balance of $777.1 billion originated
    from 2004 through 2008, which are included in Table 11, of which
    $384.0 billion have been paid off and $169.0 billion
    have defaulted or are severely delinquent and are considered
    principal at-risk at December 31, 2010. At least 25
    payments have been made on approximately 60 percent of the
    loans included in principal at-risk. We have received
    approximately $8.1 billion of representations and
    warranties claims from whole loan investors and private-label
    securitization investors related to these vintages, including
    $5.6 billion from whole loan investors, $800 million
    from one private-label securitization counterparty which were
    submitted prior to 2008 and $1.7 billion in recent demands
    from private-label securitization investors. Private-label
    securitization investors generally do not have the contractual
    right to demand repurchase of loans directly. The inclusion of
    the $1.7 billion in recent demands from private-label
    securitization investors does not mean that we believe these
    claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for
    these investors to direct the securitization trustee to take
    action or are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.
    Additionally, certain private-label securitizations are insured
    by the monolines, which are not reflected in these figures
    regarding whole loan sales and private-label securitizations.

We have resolved $5.2 billion of the claims received from
    whole loan investors and private-label securitization investors
    with losses of $1.1 billion. Approximately
    $2.1 billion of these claims were resolved through
    repurchase

or indemnification and $3.1 billion were rescinded by the
    investor. Claims outstanding related to these vintages totaled
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion
    of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an
    assessment of whether a material breach exists, $91 million
    of which are in the process of review and $1.7 billion of
    which are demands from private-label securitization investors
    received in the fourth quarter of 2010. The majority of the
    claims that we have received so far are from whole loan
    investors and until we have meaningful repurchase experiences
    with counterparties other than whole loan investors, it is not
    possible to determine whether a loss related to our
    private-label securitizations has occurred or is probable.
    However, certain whole loan investors have engaged with us in a
    consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience
    to record a liability related to existing and future claims from
    such counterparties.

On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP
    (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter,
    in its capacity as servicer on 115 private-label securitizations
    which was subsequently extended to 225 securitizations. The
    letter asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations,
    including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of
    representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans
    included in the transactions. See Recent Events

    crisis.

Financial Reform
    Act  

On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into
    law. The Financial Reform Act enacts sweeping financial
    regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct
    certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues.

Background   

The Financial Reform Act mandates that the Federal Reserve limit
    debit card interchange fees. Provisions in the legislation also
    ban banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading
    and restrict their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds
    and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions. The
    Financial Reform Act increases regulation of the derivative
    markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments
    subject to regulation and requires clearing and exchange trading
    as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements
    for derivative market participants. The Financial Reform Act
    also changes the methodology for calculating deposit insurance
    assessments from the amount of an insured depository
    institution s domestic deposits to its total assets minus
    tangible capital; provides for resolution authority to establish
    a process to unwind large systemically important financial
    companies; creates a new regulatory body to set requirements
    regarding the terms and conditions of consumer financial
    products and expands the role of state regulators in enforcing
    consumer protection requirements over banks; includes new
    minimum leverage and risk-based

56        Bank
    of America 2010

capital requirements for large financial institutions;
    disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital
    securities from Tier 1 capital; and requires securitizers
    to retain a portion of the risk that would otherwise be
    transferred into certain securitization transactions. Many of
    these provisions have begun to be phased-in or will be phased-in
    over the next several months or years and will be subject both
    to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable
    regulatory bodies.

The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and
    negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher
    costs and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital.
    The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material
    adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities
    held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial
    Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will
    depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as
    the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative
    earnings impact of certain provisions. For information on the
    impact of the Financial Reform Act on our credit ratings, see
    Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.

The Financial Reform Act and other proposed regulatory
    initiatives may also have an adverse impact on capital. During
    2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized rules
    on certain capital and liquidity measurements. For additional
    information on these rules, see Regulatory Capital  
    Regulatory Capital Changes beginning on page 64.

Debit
    Interchange Fees   

The limits that the Financial Reform Act places on debit
    interchange fees will significantly reduce our debit card
    interchange revenues. Interchange fees, or  swipe 
    fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other credit card
    companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic
    payment transactions. The legislation, which provides the
    Federal Reserve with authority over interchange fees received or
    charged by a card issuer, requires that fees must be
     reasonable and proportional  to the costs of
    processing such transactions. The Federal Reserve considered the
    functional similarity between debit card transactions and
    traditional checking transactions and the incremental costs
    incurred by a card issuer in processing a particular debit card
    transaction. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers
    and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring
    that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or
    only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine
    transaction routing.

On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed
    rule that would establish debit card interchange fee standards
    and prohibit network exclusivity arrangements and routing
    restrictions. The Federal Reserve requested comments on two
    alternative interchange fee standards that would apply to all
    covered issuers: one based on each issuer s costs, with a
    safe harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap
    initially set at $0.12 per transaction; and the other a
    stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. The
    Federal Reserve also requested comment on possible frameworks
    for an adjustment to the interchange fees to reflect certain
    issuer costs associated with fraud prevention. If the Federal
    Reserve adopts either of these proposed standards in the final
    rule, the maximum allowable interchange fee received by covered
    issuers for debit card transactions would be more than
    70 percent lower than the 2009 average once the new rule
    takes effect on July 21, 2011. The proposed rule would also
    prohibit issuers and networks from restricting the number of
    networks over which debit card transactions may be processed.
    The Federal Reserve requested comment on two alternative
    approaches: one alternative would require at least two
    unaffiliated networks per debit card, and the other would
    require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card for
    each type of cardholder authorization method (such as signature
    or PIN). Under both alternatives, the issuers and networks would
    be prohibited from inhibiting a merchant s ability to
    direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network
    that the issuer enabled to process them.

As previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of
    the Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to
    final rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit
    card revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third
    quarter of 2011. Our consumer and small business card products,
    including the debit card business, are part of an integrated
    platform within the  Global Card Services  business
    segment. In 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit
    card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial
    Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually based on
    2010 volumes. As a result, we recorded a non-tax deductible
    goodwill impairment charge for  Global Card Services  of
    $10.4 billion in 2010. We have identified other potential
    mitigation actions within  Global Card Services , but they
    are in the early stages of development and some of them may
    impact other segments. The impairment charge, which is a
    non-cash item, had no impact on our reported Tier 1 and
    tangible equity ratios. If the Federal Reserve sets the final
    interchange fee standards at the lowest proposed fee
    alternative, as described above (i.e., $0.07 per transaction)
    the lower interchange revenue may result in additional
    impairment of goodwill in  Global Card Services.  In view
    of the uncertainty with model inputs including the final ruling,
    changes in the economic outlook and the corresponding impact to
    revenues and asset quality, and the impacts of mitigation
    actions, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of
    amounts of additional goodwill impairment, if any, associated
    with changes to interchange fee standards. For more information
    on goodwill and the impairment charge, refer to
     Note 10   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex
    Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107.

Limitations on
    Certain Activities   

We anticipate that the final regulations associated with the
    Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain
    activities, including limitations on the use of a bank s
    own capital for proprietary trading and sponsorship or
    investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (Volcker
    Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are required to
    be in place by October 21, 2011, and the Volcker Rule
    becomes effective twelve months after such rules are final or on
    July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Volcker Rule then
    gives banking entities two years from the effective date (with
    opportunities for additional extensions) to bring activities and
    investments into conformance. In anticipation of the adoption of
    the final regulations, we have begun winding down our
    proprietary trading line of business. The ultimate impact of the
    Volcker Rule or the winding down of this business, and the time
    it will take to comply or complete, continues to remain
    uncertain. The final regulations issued may impose additional
    operational and compliance costs on us.

Derivatives   

The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope
    of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring
    clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing
    new capital and margin requirements for certain market
    participants and imposing position limits on certain
     over-the-counter 
    (OTC) derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the
    SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings
    by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until
    July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to
    implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these
    derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply,
    continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose
    additional operational and compliance costs on us and may
    require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively
    impact our revenues and results of operations.

FDIC Deposit
    Insurance Assessments   

Since the financial crisis began several years ago, an
    increasing number of bank failures has imposed significant costs
    on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the
    regulator s deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In
    order to

Bank of America
    2010        57  

Table of Contents   

maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of
    the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may
    increase in the future, assessment rates of insured
    institutions, including Bank of America.

Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC,
    subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the
    FDIC s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act,
    FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to
    $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides
    for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing
    demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on
    December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The
    FDIC administers the Deposit Insurance Fund, and all insured
    depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the
    FDIC that fund the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Financial Reform
    Act changed the methodology for calculating deposit insurance
    assessments from the amount of an insured depository
    institution s domestic deposits to its total assets minus
    tangible capital. On February 7, 2011 the FDIC issued a new
    regulation implementing revisions to the assessment system
    mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The new regulation will be
    effective April 1, 2011 and will be reflected in the
    June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the invoices for
    assessments due September 30, 2011. As a result of the new
    regulations, we expect to incur higher annual deposit insurance
    assessments. We have identified potential mitigation actions,
    but they are in the early stages of development and we are not
    able to directly control the basis or the amount of premiums
    that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance or for other fees
    or assessment obligations imposed on financial institutions. Any
    future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other
    bank industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

CARD
    Act  

On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The
    majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February
    2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit
    card reform related to credit card industry practices including
    significantly restricting banks  ability to change interest
    rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk,
    changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to
    consumer credit card disclosures. The provisions of the CARD Act
    negatively impacted net interest income and card income during
    2010, and are expected to negatively impact future net interest
    income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit
    cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed
    on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue was
    approximately $1.5 billion.

Regulation E  

On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments
    to Regulation E which implements the Electronic
    Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on
    July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for
    existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other
    banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card
    transactions that overdraw a consumer s account unless the
    consumer affirmatively consents to the bank s payment of
    overdrafts for those transactions. Under previously announced
    plans, we do not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to
    overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card
    transactions. However, customers are able to opt-in on a
     withdrawal-by-withdrawal 
    basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network
    where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction
    may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to
    proceed. The impact of Regulation E, which was in effect
    beginning in the third quarter and fully in effect in the fourth
    quarter of 2010, and our overdraft policy changes, which were in
    effect for the full year of 2010, was a reduction in service
    charges during 2010 of approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011,
    the incremental reduction to service charges related to
    Regulation E and overdraft policy changes is expected

to be approximately $1.1 billion, or a full-year impact of
    approximately $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation
    action.

U.K. Corporate
    Income Tax Rate  

On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change
    reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective
    for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1,
    2011. While this rate reduction favorably affects income tax
    expense on future U.K. earnings, it also required us to
    remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax
    rate, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of
    $392 million in 2010. A future rate reduction of one
    percent per year is generally expected to be enacted in each of
    2011, 2012 and 2013, which would result in a similar charge to
    income tax expense of nearly $400 million during each of
    the three years. The U.K. Treasury has asked for taxpayer views
    on whether the U.K. government should alternatively enact the
    full remaining three-percent reduction entirely during 2011,
    which would accelerate the possible charges into 2011 for a
    total of approximately $1.1 billion.

Final Regulatory
    Guidance on Consolidation  

On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift
    Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule
    regarding risk-based capital requirements related to the impact
    of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The impact on the
    Corporation on January 1, 2010 due to the new consolidation
    guidance and the final rule was an increase in risk-weighted
    assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of
    $9.7 billion. The overall impact of the new consolidation
    guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1
    capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and
    73 bps. For more information, see Balance Sheet
    Overview   Impact of Adopting New Consolidation
    Guidance on page 29, Capital Management beginning on
    page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.

Payment
    Protection Insurance  

In the U.K., the Corporation sells PPI through its  Global
    Card Services  business to credit card customers and has
    previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. In
    response to an elevated level of customer complaints of
    misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media
    coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K.
    Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and raised
    concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints
    relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In August
    2010, the FSA issued a policy statement on the assessment and
    remediation of PPI claims which is applicable to the
    Corporation s U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to
    address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the
    handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The policy
    statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to
    current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or
    did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the
    insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to
    remedies. Given the new regulatory guidance, in 2010, the
    Corporation had a liability of $630 million based on its current
    claims history and an estimate of future claims that have yet to
    be asserted against the Corporation. For additional information
    on PPI, see  Note 14   Commitments and
    Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements   Payment Protection Insurance Claims
    Matter on page 196.

U.K. Bank
    Levy  

On June 22, 2010, the U.K. government announced that it
    intended to introduce an annual bank levy. Beginning in 2011,
    the bank levy will be payable on the consolidated liabilities,
    subject to certain exclusions and offsets, of U.K. group
    companies and U.K. branches of foreign banking groups as of each
    year-end balance sheet date. As currently proposed, the bank
    levy rate for 2011 and

58        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

future years will be 0.075 percent per annum for certain
    short-term liabilities with a rate of 0.0375 percent per
    annum for longer maturity liabilities and certain deposits. The
    legislation is expected to be enacted in the third quarter of
    2011. We currently estimate that the cost of the U.K. bank levy
    will be approximately $125 million annually beginning in
    2011.

Regulatory
    Guidance on Collateral Dependent Loans  

On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying
    guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified
    consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to
    demonstrate a borrower s capacity to repay the modified
    loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified
    consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of
    these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were
    deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that a
    modified loan deemed to be collateral dependent be written down
    to its estimated collateral value even if that loan is
    performing. The application of this guidance resulted in
    $1.0 billion of net charge-offs in 2010, of which
    $822 million were home equity, $207 million were
    residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real
    estate.

Making Home
    Affordable Program  

On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details
    related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program
    (MHA) which is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures
    and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA
    consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)
    which provides guidelines on first-lien loan modifications, and
    the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides
    guidelines for loan refinancing.

As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the
    U.S. government announced intentions to create the
    second-lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to
    reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and
    lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion
    of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property.
    This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all
    eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program.
    Additional clarification on government guidelines for the
    program was announced early in 2010. On April 8, 2010, we
    began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial
    modification offers to eligible home equity customers. We will
    modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of
    whether the MHA modified  first lien  is serviced by
    the Corporation or another participating servicer.

On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable
    Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another
    addition to the HAMP that assists borrowers with non-retention
    options, such as short sale or
     deed-in-lieu 
    options, instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides
    incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall
    under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work
    with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other
    homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing
    non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an
    important option for homeowners who are facing financial
    difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the
    home. HAFA s short sale guidelines are designed to
    streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible
    with Bank of America s new cooperative short sale program.

During 2010, 285,000 loan modifications were completed with a
    total unpaid principal balance of $65.7 billion, including
    109,000 loans with a total unpaid principal amount of
    $25.5 billion that were converted from trial-period to
    permanent modifications under the MHA, which include HAMP
    first-lien modifications and 2MP second-lien modifications. In
    addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government
    announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that include
    principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a
     sub-segment 
    of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility,
    forgiveness arrangements and the incentive structures are still
    being finalized. However, we

implemented a forgiveness program on a subset of HAMP eligible
    products under the National Home Retention Program (NHRP) in
    2010.

In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented
    several programs designed to help our customers. For information
    on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on
    page 71. We will continue to help our customers address
    financial challenges through these government programs and our
    own home retention programs.

Stress
    Tests  

The Corporation has established management routines to
    periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts
    to the Corporation under hypothetical economic scenarios. These
    stress tests will facilitate our contingency planning and
    management of capital and liquidity. These processes were also
    used to conduct the recent secondary stress testing imposed by
    the Federal Reserve and were incorporated into the Capital Plan
    that was submitted as part of this request, which included a
    proposed modest increase in our common dividend in the second
    half of 2011. The results of these stress tests may influence
    bank regulatory supervisory requirements concerning the
    Corporation and may impact the amount or timing of dividends or
    distributions to the Corporation s stockholders. For
    additional information, see Capital Management beginning on
    page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67.

Other
    Matters  

The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for
    managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the
    Corporation s subsidiaries with regulatory capital
    requirements, including branch operations of banking
    subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory
    capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets
    for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed  well
    capitalized  levels.

The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity
    requirements for local financial institutions, including
    regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies
    and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K.
    banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the
    creation and production of recovery and resolution plans
    (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities. We are
    currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives.

Managing
    Risk  

Overview  

Risk is inherent in every activity that we undertake. Our
    business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity,
    compliance, operational and reputational risk. We must manage
    these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the
    integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings.

Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business
    decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or
    failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment,
    business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence,
    regulatory environment, business strategy execution,
     and/or  other
    inherent risks of the business including reputational risk.
    Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s
    or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations. Market
    risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or
    revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
    conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is
    the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial
    obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due.
    Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to
    adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and
    procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from
    inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or
    external events. Reputational risk is the potential that
    negative publicity regarding an organization s conduct or
    business practices will adversely affect its profitability,
    operations or customer base, or require costly

Bank of America
    2010        59  

Table of Contents   

litigation or other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated
    within all of the risk categories and throughout the risk
    management process, and as such is not discussed separately
    herein. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management
    beginning on page 62, Capital Management beginning on
    page 63, Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67, Credit
    Risk Management beginning on page 71, Market Risk
    Management beginning on page 100, Compliance Risk
    Management on page 106 and Operational Risk Management
    beginning on page 106, address in more detail the specific
    procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of
    risk that we manage.

In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity
    for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our
    financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic
    potential of our Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and
    flexible financial position that will allow us to successfully
    weather challenging economic times and take advantage of
    opportunities to grow. We also intend to focus on maintaining
    our relevance and value to customers, associates and
    shareholders. To achieve these objectives, we have built a
    comprehensive risk management culture and have implemented
    governance and control measures to maintain that culture.

Our risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to
    meet the heightened challenges posed by the increased complexity
    of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased
    size and global footprint, and by the financial crisis. We have
    a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite
    which is approved annually by the Corporation s Board of
    Directors (the Board).

We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk
    management planning is fully integrated with strategic,
    financial and customer/client planning so that goals and
    responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is
    managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as
    a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and
    within individual business units, products, services and
    transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a
    governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for
    risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight
    of those activities, by executive management and the Board.

Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the
    risk-adjusted returns of each business segment through review
    and approval of strategic and financial operating plans. By
    allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite
    for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the
    ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each
    business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating
    each segment s stand-alone credit, market, interest rate
    and operational risk components, and is used to measure
    risk-adjusted returns. Businesses operate within their credit,
    market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in
    order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on
    analyses of risk and reward in each line of business, and
    executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting
    performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines
    or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution
    of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with
    the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through
    its committees.

On December 14, 2010, the Board completed its annual review
    and approval of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite
    Statement for the Corporation. The Risk Framework defines the
    accountability of the Corporation and its associates and the
    Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we
    will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to
    maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our
    assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is
    designed to be used by our associates to understand risk
    management activities, including their individual roles and
    accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is
    integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the
    risk management governance structure, including
    management s involvement. The risk management
    responsibilities of the lines of business, governance and
    control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined,
    and reflects how the

Board-approved risk appetite influences business and risk
    strategy. The risk management process contains four elements:
    identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor
    and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across
    all business activities to enable an integrated and
    comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Board s
    Risk Appetite Statement.

Risk Management
    Processes and Methods  

To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite,
    and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance
    structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk
    management activities, as well as governance and oversight of
    those activities, by management and the Board. All associates
    have accountability for risk management. Each associate s
    risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major
    categories: lines of business, governance and control (Global
    Risk Management and enterprise control functions) and Corporate
    Audit.

Line of business managers and associates are accountable for
    identifying, managing and escalating attention, as appropriate,
    to all risks in their business units, including existing and
    emerging risks. Line of business managers must ensure that their
    business activities are conducted within the risk appetite
    defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and
    controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk
    Appetite Statement. Line of business associates in client and
    customer facing businesses are responsible for
     day-to-day 
    business activities, including developing and delivering
    profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests
    and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These
    associates are accountable for conducting their daily work in
    accordance with policies and procedures. It is the
    responsibility of each associate to protect the Corporation and
    defend the interests of the shareholders.

Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk
    Management and the enterprise control functions. Global Risk
    Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads
    senior management in managing risk, is independent from the
    Corporation s lines of business and enterprise control
    functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and
    implement meaningful risk management measures. This position
    serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO
    reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the
    management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk
    governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that
    appropriate risk management practices are in place, effective
    and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk
    appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of
    risk teams, Enterprise Risk Teams and independent line of
    business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent
    from the lines of business and enterprise control functions.

Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for setting and
    establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards,
    assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk
    oversight, and reporting and monitoring for systemic and
    emerging risk issues. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Teams are
    responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are
    reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk
    teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise
    control functions.

Independent line of business risk teams are responsible for
    establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and
    thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the lines
    of business to which they are aligned. The independent line of
    business risk teams are responsible for ensuring that risk
    limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk
    appetite.

Enterprise control functions are independent of the lines of
    business and have risk governance and control responsibilities
    for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for
    setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk
    reporting; monitoring for systemic risk issues including
    existing, emerging and reputational; and implementing procedures
    and controls at the enterprise and line of business levels for
    their respective control functions. Enterprise control functions
    consist of the Chief Financial Officer group, Global

60        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, Global
    Marketing and Corporate Affairs, and Legal.

The Corporate Audit function and the Corporate General Auditor
    maintain independence from the lines of business and governance
    and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit
    Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent
    assessment and validation through testing of key processes and
    controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit provides an
    independent assessment of the Corporation s management and
    internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are
    designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are
    adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and
    operating information is materially complete, accurate and
    reliable; and employees  actions are in compliance with the
    Corporation s policies, standards, procedures, and
    applicable laws and regulations.

To ensure that the Corporation s goals and objectives, risk
    appetite, and business and risk strategies are achieved, we
    utilize a risk management process that is applied across the
    execution of all business activities. This risk management
    process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework,
    enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and
    comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make
    strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive
    view. Corporate goals and objectives and our risk appetite are
    established by management, approved by the Board, and are key
    drivers to setting business and risk strategy.

One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use
    of Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the
    primary method for facilitating the management of Business
    Environment and Internal Control Factor (BEICF) data. The
     end-to-end 
    RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of
    the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating
    risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration
    with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates
    documentation by either the line of business or enterprise
    control function of the business environment, risks, controls,
    and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive
    risk management view that enables understanding of and action on
    operational risks and controls for all of our processes,
    products, activities and systems.

The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our
    overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the
    actions of our associates

are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code
    of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code
    of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to
    conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of
    our products or services to our customers. We instill a strong
    and comprehensive risk management culture through
    communications, training, policies, procedures, and
    organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we
    continue to strengthen the link between the associate
    performance management process and individual compensation to
    encourage associates to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.

Board Oversight
    of Risk  

We maintain a governance structure that delineates the
    responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as
    governance and oversight of those activities, by management and
    the Board. The majority of our directors, including the Chairman
    of the Board, are considered independent and meet the
    requirements of our Director Independence Categorical Standards
    and the criteria for independence in the listing standards of
    the New York Stock Exchange. Also, all members of the Audit and
    Enterprise Risk Committees are independent and all members of
    the Credit Committee are non-management directors.

The Board is responsible for the oversight of the management of
    the Corporation. As part of its oversight, the Board oversees
    the management of the various types of risk faced by the
    Corporation. Our corporate risk management governance structure
    is designed to align the interests of the Board and management
    with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity
    throughout the Corporation.

The Board, under the leadership of its independent Chairman,
    oversees the management of the Corporation through the
    governance structure, which includes Board committees and
    management committees. The Board maintains standing committees
    to oversee risk. The committees with the majority of risk
    oversight responsibilities include the Credit, Enterprise Risk
    and Audit Committees.

The figure below illustrates the inter-relationship between the
    Board, Board level committees and management level committees
    with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the
    Corporation.

(1)  Compliance

    Risk activities, including Ethics Oversight, are required to be
    reviewed by the Audit Committee and Operational Risk activities
    are required to be reviewed by the Enterprise Risk Committee.

(2)  The

    Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in fulfilling their
    responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of the
    Corporation s disclosures and reports the results of the
    process to the Audit Committee.

The Credit Committee is responsible for oversight of senior
    management s identification and management of the
    Corporation s credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis,
    as well as the Corporation s responses to trends affecting
    those exposures. The Credit Committee is also responsible for
    oversight of senior management s actions relating to the
    adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the
    Corporation s credit-related policies.

The Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for exercising
    oversight of senior management s responsibility to identify
    the material risks facing the Corporation and oversight of
    senior management s planning for and management of the
    Corporation s material risks, including market risk,
    interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and
    reputational risk. The Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees
    senior management s establishment of policies and
    guidelines articulating the Corporation s risk tolerances
    for material categories of risk, the performance and functioning
    of the Corporation s overall risk management function, and
    senior management s establishment of appropriate systems
    that support control of market risk, interest rate risk and
    liquidity risk.

The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in
    overseeing the integrity of the Corporation s Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the
    Corporation s system of internal controls and policies and
    procedures for managing and assessing risk, including compliance
    with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee also
    provides approval and direct oversight of the independent
    registered public accounting firm, including such firm s
    assessment of management s assertion of the effectiveness
    of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures and

the Corporation s internal control over financial
    reporting; and oversight of such accountant s appointment,
    compensation, qualifications and independence. The Audit
    Committee also oversees the corporate audit function.

The Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees provide
    enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporation s management
    and handling of risk. Each of these three committees reports
    regularly to the Board on risk-related matters within its
    responsibilities and together they provide the Board with
    integrated, thorough insight about our management of strategic,
    credit, market, liquidity, compliance, legal, operational and
    reputational risks. At meetings of each Board committee and our
    Board, directors receive updates from management regarding all
    aspects of enterprise risk management, including our performance
    against our identified risk appetite.

Executive management develops for Board approval the
    Corporation s Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement, and
    strategic and financial operating plans. Management and the
    Board, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees,
    monitor financial performance, execution of the strategic and
    financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite,
    and the adequacy of internal controls.

Strategic
    Risk Management  

Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is one
    of the major risk categories along with credit, market,
    liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is
    the risk that results from adverse business decisions,

ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to
    respond to changes in the competitive environment, business
    cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory
    environment, business strategy execution
     and/or  other
    inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. In
    the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to
    changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our
    appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of
    the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and
    carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace.
    Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall
    financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the
    Chief Executive Officer and executive management team.
    Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or
    capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board.

Executive management and the Board approve a strategic plan
    every two to three years. Annually, executive management
    develops a financial operating plan and the Board reviews and
    approves the plan. With oversight by the Board, executive
    management ensures that the plans are consistent with the
    Corporation s strategic plan, core operating tenets and
    risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews:
    forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk
    profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing
    levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing
    results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth
    rates and peer analysis. With oversight by the Board, executive
    management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and
    defines changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital
    or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and
    optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite and
    shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial
    strength.

We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements
    for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks.
    The economic capital assigned to each line of business is based
    on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board,
    executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each
    business in approving strategic and financial operating plans.
    The businesses use economic capital to define business
    strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client
    profitability.

Capital
    Management  

Bank of America manages its capital position to maintain a
    strong and flexible financial position in order to perform
    through economic cycles, take advantage of organic growth
    opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets,
    remain a source of financial strength for its subsidiaries, and
    return capital to its shareholders as appropriate.

To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the
    results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
    (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and
    feedback from investors, ratings agencies and regulators. Based
    upon this analysis we set capital guidelines for Tier 1
    common capital and Tier 1 capital to ensure we can maintain
    an adequate capital position in a severe adverse economic
    scenario. We also target to maintain capital in excess of the
    capital required per our economic capital measurement process
    (see Economic Capital on page 66). Management and the Board
    annually approve a comprehensive Capital Plan which documents
    the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the
    capital guidelines, and planned capital actions and capital
    adequacy assessment.

The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results,
    economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of
    regulatory changes. We generate monthly regulatory capital and
    economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent
    earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly
    stress tests to assess the potential impacts to earnings,
    capital and liquidity for a variety of economic stress
    scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify
    and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts,
    stress tests or economic capital. Given the significant proposed
    regulatory capital changes, we also regularly assess the
    potential capital

impacts and monitor associated mitigation actions. Management
    continuously assesses ICAAP results and provides documented
    quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines
    and capital position to the Board.

Capital management is integrated into the risk and governance
    processes, as capital is a key consideration in development of
    the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic
    capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform
    risk-adjusted return analysis at the business unit, client
    relationship and transaction level.

Regulatory
    Capital  

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the
    risk-based capital guidelines (Basel I) issued by the
    Federal Reserve. At December 31, 2010, we operated banking
    activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, N.A.
    and FIA Card Services, N.A. which are subject to the risk-based
    capital guidelines issued by the Office of the Comptroller of
    the Currency (OCC). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and
    its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based
    on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total
    capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios
    are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted
    assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted
    quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1
    leverage ratio.

Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of  core
    capital elements.  The predominate components of core
    capital elements are qualifying common stockholders 
    equity, any CES and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred
    stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust
    preferred capital debt securities (Trust Securities),
    hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in
    subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing
     restricted core capital elements.  Goodwill, other
    disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and
    the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial
    liabilities accounted for under a fair value option that are
    included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in
    the company s own creditworthiness are deducted from the
    sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is Tier 1
    plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as
    qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance
    for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains
    on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital
    is not an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the
    Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment
    Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1
    capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid
    securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in
    subsidiaries.

Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on-
    and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on
    trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures.
    Credit risk risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a
    prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the
    credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures.
    The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon
    the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable.
    Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees,
    unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives.
    Market risk risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk
    models for the trading account positions, including all foreign
    exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable
    accounting guidance. Under Basel I there are no risk-weighted
    assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a
    direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded
    from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets
    consistent with regulatory guidance.

For additional information on these and other regulatory
    requirements, see  Note 18   Regulatory
    Requirements and Restrictions  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Capital
    Composition and Ratios  

On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule
    regarding the impact of the new consolidation guidance on
    risk-based capital. The incremental impact on January 1,
    2010 was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and
    risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in
    Tier 1 common

Bank of America
    2010        63  

Table of Contents   

capital and Tier 1 capital of $9.7 billion. The
    overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final
    rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1
    common capital ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps on
    January 1, 2010.

We continued to strengthen capital in 2010 as evidenced by the
    $4.7 billion growth in Tier 1 common capital or
    $14.4 billion before the impact of the new consolidation
    guidance. The increase was driven by the $10.2 billion in
    earnings generated in 2010, excluding the goodwill impairment
    charges of $12.4 billion. Tier 1 capital and Total
    capital grew by $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion in 2010
    or by $13.0 billion and $12.9 billion when adjusted
    for the impact of the new consolidation guidance.

Risk-weighted assets declined by $87 billion in 2010
    including the impact of the new consolidation guidance. The
    risk-weighted asset reduction is consistent with our continued
    efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios.

As a result of the increased capital position and reduced
    risk-weighted assets, the Tier 1 common capital ratio
    increased 79 bps to 8.60 percent, the Tier 1
    capital ratio increased 84 bps to 11.24 percent and
    Total capital increased 111 bps to 15.77 percent in
    2010. When adjusted for the impacts of the new consolidation
    guidance, the growth in the ratios was more significant.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 33 bps to
    7.21 percent, reflecting both the strengthening of the
    capital position previously mentioned and a $62 billion
    reduction in adjusted quarterly average total assets including
    the impact of the new consolidation guidance.

The $12.4 billion goodwill impairment charges recognized
    during 2010 did not impact the regulatory capital ratios.

Regulatory
    Capital Changes  

In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published by the
    Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee)
    with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital
    requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital.
    While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses,
    we also manage regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory
    standards of capital adequacy.

The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) which was published
    in December 2007 established requirements for
    U.S. implementation of the Basel Committee s
    Basel II Accord and provides detailed requirements for a
    new regulatory capital framework. This regulatory capital
    framework includes requirements related to credit and
    operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements

(Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We
    began the Basel II parallel qualification period on
    April 1, 2010.

Designated U.S. financial institutions are required to
    complete a minimum parallel qualification period under
    Basel II of four consecutive successful quarters before
    receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using
    the Basel II methodology and exiting the parallel period.
    During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations
    under both the current risk-based capital rules (Basel
    I) and Basel II will be reported to the financial
    institutions  regulatory supervisors. Once the parallel
    period is successfully completed and we have received approval
    to exit parallel, we will transition to Basel II as the
    methodology for calculating regulatory capital. Basel II
    provides for a three-year transitional floor subsequent to
    exiting parallel, after which Basel I may be discontinued. The
    Collins Amendment within the Financial

Reform Act and the U.S. banking regulators  subsequent
    Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published by the Federal Reserve
    on December 14, 2010 propose however that the current
    three-year transitional floors under Basel II be replaced
    with a permanent risk based capital floor as defined under Basel
    I.

On December 16, 2010, U.S. regulators issued a Notice
    of Proposed Rulemaking on the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines for
    Market Risk (Market Risk Rules), reflecting partial adoption of
    the Basel Committee s July 2009 consultative document on
    the topic. We anticipate U.S. regulators will adopt the
    Market Risk Rules in mid-2011. This change is expected to
    significantly increase the capital requirements for our trading
    assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposures which
    meet the definition established by the regulatory agencies. We
    continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules
    and currently anticipate being fully compliant with any final
    rules by the projected implementation date of year-end 2011.

On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued
     Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more
    resilient banks and banking systems  (Basel III), proposing
    a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented
    by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III could
    significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III
    and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of
    trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the
    Financial Reform Act proposing the disqualification be phased in
    from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of
    certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs,
    investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others,
    within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of other
    comprehensive income in capital, increased capital for
    counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer
    requirements. The phase-in period for the capital deductions is
    proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014
    through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018.

    risk is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in
    period for the new minimum capital requirements and related
    buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019.
    U.S. regulators are expected to begin the final rulemaking
    processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a
    goal to adopt final rules by year-end 2011 or early 2012. For
    additional information on our MSRs, refer to
     Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on
    deferred tax assets, refer to  Note 21   Income
    Taxes  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

If Basel III is implemented in the U.S. consistent
    with Basel Committee rules, beginning in January 2013, we would
    be required to maintain minimum capital ratio requirements of
    6.0 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8.0 percent
    for Total capital. Basel III also includes a proposed
    minimum requirement for common equity Tier 1 capital of
    3.5 percent beginning in 2013 which would

increase to 4.5 percent in 2015. Basel III also
    includes three capital buffers which would be phased in over
    time and impact all three capital ratios. These buffers include
    a capital conservation buffer that would start at
    0.63 percent in 2016 and increase to 2.5 percent in
    2019. Thus, the minimum capital ratio requirements including the
    capital conservation buffer in 2019 would be 7.0 percent
    for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5 percent for
    Tier 1 capital and 10.5 percent for Total capital. If
    ratios fall below the minimum requirement plus the capital
    conservation buffer, such as 10.5 percent for Total
    capital, an institution would be required to restrict dividends,
    share repurchases and discretionary bonuses. Additionally,
    Basel III also includes a countercyclical buffer of up to
    2.5 percent that regulators could require in periods of
    excess credit growth. The countercyclical buffer is to be
    comprised of loss-absorbing capital, such as common equity, and
    is meant to retain additional capital during periods of excess
    credit growth providing incremental protection in the event of a
    material market downturn. The ratios presented above do not
    include the third buffer requirement for systemically important
    financial institutions, which the Basel Committee continues to
    assess and has not yet quantified. The countercyclical and
    systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased in from 2013 through
    2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the rulemaking
    processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a
    goal to adopt final rules by the end of 2011 or early 2012.

These regulatory changes also require approval by the agencies
    of analytical models used as part of our capital measurement and
    assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If
    these more complex models are not approved, it could require
    financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some
    cases could be significant.

We expect to maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio in
    excess of eight percent as the regulatory rule changes are
    implemented without needing to raise new equity capital. We have
    made the implementation and mitigation of these regulatory
    changes a strategic priority. We also note there remains
    significant uncertainty on the final impacts as the
    U.S. has issued final rules only for Basel II and a
    Notice of Proposal Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at this
    time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules and
    the regulatory agencies interpret the final rules for Basel III
    during the implementation process.

The table below presents regulatory capital information for Bank
    of America N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. at December 31,
    2010 and 2009. The goodwill impairment charges recognized in
    2010 did not impact the regulatory capital ratios.

The Bank of America, N.A. Tier 1 and Total capital ratio
    increased 48 bps to 10.78 percent and 50 bps to
    14.26 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to
    December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratios was driven by
    $11.1 billion

in earnings generated in 2010 combined with a $26.4 billion
    decline in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio
    increased 45 bps to 7.83 percent benefiting from the
    improvement in Tier 1 capital combined with a
    $56.0 billion

decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets. The
    reduction in risk-weighted assets and adjusted quarterly average
    total assets is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce
    non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios.

The FIA Card Services, N.A. Tier 1 capital ratio increased
    9 bps to 15.30 percent and Total capital ratio
    decreased 7 bps to 16.94 percent compared to
    December 31, 2009. The increase in Tier 1 capital
    ratio was due to a decrease in risk-weighted assets of
    $22.3 billion. The decrease in the Total capital ratio was
    due to a reduction in Tier 2 capital resulting from a
    $390 million decrease in qualifying term subordinated debt
    combined with a net increase in the allowance for credit losses
    limitation of $269 million. The Tier 1 leverage ratio
    decreased to 13.21 percent at December 31, 2010 from
    23.09 percent at December 31, 2009 due to a
    $68.9 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total
    assets. The increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets
    was the result of the adoption of new consolidation guidance.

Broker/Dealer
    Regulatory Capital  

Bank of America s principal U.S. broker/dealer
    subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith
    (MLPF S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp
    (MLPCC). MLPCC is a subsidiary of MLPF S and provides
    clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to
    the net capital requirements of SEC
     Rule 15c3-1. 
    Both entities are also registered as futures commission
    merchants and subject to the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17.

MLPF S has elected to compute the minimum capital
    requirement in accordance with the  Alternative Net Capital
    Requirement  as permitted by SEC
     Rule 15c3-1. 
    At December 31, 2010, MLPF S s regulatory net
    capital as defined by
     Rule 15c3-1 
    was $9.8 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of
    $736 million by $9.1 billion. MLPCC s net capital
    of $2.3 billion exceeded the minimum requirement by
    $2.1 billion.

In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements,
    MLPF S is required to maintain tentative net capital in
    excess of $1 billion and notify the SEC in the event its
    tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At
    December 31, 2010, MLPF S had tentative net capital in
    excess of the minimum and notification requirements.

Economic
    Capital  

Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based
    measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit,
    market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a
    99.97 percent confidence level, consistent with a
     AA  credit rating. Economic capital is allocated to
    each business unit based upon its risk positions and
    contribution to enterprise risk, and is used for capital
    adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes.
    The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with
    the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns
    consistently across all businesses and activities.

Credit Risk
    Capital  

Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks:
    default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to
    outright default or the borrower s inability to repay an
    obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents
    potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over
    the one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and
    modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures
    within
     sub-categories 
    for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities.
    The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as
    concentration and country risk and originated securitizations.
    The economic capital methodology is based on the probability

of default, loss given default, exposure at default and maturity
    for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across
    exposures. See page 71 for more information on Credit Risk
    Management.

Market Risk
    Capital  

Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of
    financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in foreign
    exchange and interest rates, credit spreads, and security and
    commodity prices. Bank of America s primary market risk
    exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs
    and the interest rate exposure of its core balance sheet.
    Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models the
    Corporation used to manage these risks including, for example,
    Value-at-Risk, simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis.
    See page 100 for additional information on Market Risk
    Management.

Operational Risk
    Capital  

We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level
    using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We
    supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk
    control assessments. See Operational Risk Management beginning
    on page 106 for more information.

Capital
    Actions  

The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on
    February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval
    of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our
    common stock from 10.0 billion to 11.3 billion. On
    February 24, 2010, approximately 1.3 billion shares of
    common stock were issued through the conversion of CES into
    common stock. For more information regarding this conversion,
    see Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges on page 67.

In January 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 billion shares
    of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Merrill
    Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch
    acquisition, see  Note 2   Merger and
    Restructuring Activity  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In addition, in 2009, we issued warrants to purchase
    approximately 199.1 million shares of common stock in
    connection with preferred stock issuances to the
    U.S. government. For more information, see Preferred Stock
    Issuances and Exchanges on page 67. In 2009, we issued
    1.3 billion shares of common stock at an average price of
    $10.77 per share through an
     at-the-market 
    issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately
    $13.5 billion. In addition, during 2010 and 2009, we issued
    approximately 98.6 million and 7.4 million shares
    under employee stock plans.

Troubled Asset
    Relief Program   Related Asset Sales  

We received notification from the Federal Reserve confirming
    that we fulfilled our commitment to increase equity by
    $3.0 billion through asset sales to be completed by
    December 31, 2010. The commitment was made in connection
    with the approval we received in December 2009 to repurchase the
    preferred stock that we issued as a result of our participation
    in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

There were no common shares repurchased in 2010 except for
    shares acquired under equity incentive plans, as discussed in
    Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of
    this
     Form 10-K. 
    Currently, there is no existing Board authorized share
    repurchase program. For more information regarding our common
    share issuances, see  Note 15  
    Shareholders  Equity  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

We currently intend to modestly increase the common stock
    dividends in the second half of 2011 subject to approval by the
    Federal Reserve.

Preferred Stock
    Issuances and Exchanges  

In 2009, we completed an offer to exchange outstanding
    depositary shares of portions of certain series of preferred
    stock up to approximately 200 million shares of common
    stock at an average price of $12.70 per share. In addition, we
    also entered into agreements with certain holders of other
    non-government perpetual preferred shares to exchange their
    holdings of approximately $10.9 billion aggregate
    liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into
    approximately 800 million shares of common stock. In total,
    the exchange offer and these privately negotiated exchanges
    covered the exchange of $14.8 billion aggregate liquidation
    preference of perpetual preferred stock into 1.0 billion
    shares of common stock. In 2009, we recorded an increase to
    retained earnings and net income applicable to common
    shareholders of $576 million related to these exchanges.
    This represents the net of a $2.6 billion benefit due to
    the excess of the carrying value of our non-convertible
    preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock
    exchanged. This was partially offset by a $2.0 billion
    inducement to convertible preferred shareholders representing
    the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged,
    which was accounted for as an induced conversion of convertible
    preferred stock, over the fair value of the common stock that
    would have been issued under the original conversion terms.

On December 2, 2009, we received approval from the
    U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to repay the
    U.S. government s $45.0 billion preferred stock
    investment provided under TARP. In accordance with the approval,
    on December 9, 2009, we repurchased all outstanding shares
    of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series N,
    Series Q and Series R issued to the U.S. Treasury
    as part of the TARP. While participating in the TARP we recorded
    $7.4 billion in dividends and accretion on the TARP
    Preferred Stock and repayment saved us approximately
    $3.6 billion in annual dividends and accretion. We did not
    repurchase the related common stock warrants issued to the
    U.S. Treasury in connection with its TARP investment. The
    U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010. For
    more detail on the TARP Preferred Stock, refer to
     Note 15   Shareholders  Equity  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We repurchased the TARP Preferred Stock through the use of
    $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in
    proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of CES valued
    at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares
    representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior
    Preferred Stock Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and
    warrants (Contingent Warrants) to purchase an aggregate
    60 million shares of the Corporation s common stock.
    Each depositary share represented a
    1/1,000 th 

    interest in a share of Common Equivalent Stock and each
    Contingent Warrant granted the holder the right to purchase
    0.0467 of a share of a common stock for $0.01 per share. Each
    depositary share entitled the holder, through the depository, to
    a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences
    of the Common Equivalent Stock, including conversion, dividend,
    liquidation and voting rights.

The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on
    February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval
    of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation to increase the number of

authorized shares of our common stock. Following effectiveness
    of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common
    Equivalent Stock converted in full into our common stock and the
    Contingent Warrants automatically expired without becoming
    exercisable, and the CES ceased to exist.

On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares of the
    mandatory convertible Preferred Stock, Series 2 and
    Series 3, of Merrill Lynch automatically converted into an
    aggregate of 50 million shares of the Corporation s
    Common Stock in accordance with the terms of these preferred
    securities.

For more information on cash dividends declared on preferred
    stock, see Table III.

Enterprise-wide
    Stress Testing  

As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct
    enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better
    understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to
    certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and
    market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These
    enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the
    potential impacts from our risk profile to earnings, capital and
    liquidity, and serve as a key component of our capital
    management practices. Scenarios are selected by a group
    comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance
    executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario
    are then determined and analyzed, primarily leveraging the
    models and processes utilized in everyday management routines.
    Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions
    that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is
    compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee
    (ROC), Asset Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and the
    Board s Enterprise Risk Committee, and serves to inform and
    be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into
    decision-making by management and the Board. We have made
    substantial investments to establish stress testing capabilities
    as a core business process.

Liquidity
    Risk  

Funding and
    Liquidity Risk Management  

We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our
    contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or
    off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity
    objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses
    throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress.
    To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity
    risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding
    sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess
    liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and
    high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to
    meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.

Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are
    centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a
    centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management
    enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements,
    maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs
    and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.

The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporation s
    liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including
    establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC, in
    conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our
    liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions
    on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity
    risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established
    tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight
    responsibilities to the ROC, which reports to ALMRC. The ROC
    reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow
    forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements
    our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, refer
    to Board Oversight of Risk beginning on page 61.

Under this governance framework, we have developed certain
    funding and liquidity risk management practices which include:
    maintaining excess

    2010        67  

Table of Contents   

liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries,
    including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining
    what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these
    entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other
    potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience
    during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources,
    considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and
    performing contingency planning.

Global Excess
    Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets  

We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company and
    selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality,
    liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets serve as our
    primary means of liquidity risk mitigation and we call these
    assets our  Global Excess Liquidity Sources.  Our cash
    is primarily on deposit with central banks, such as the Federal
    Reserve. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid,
    unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities,
    U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select
    group of
     non-U.S. government 
    securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these
    securities, even in stressed market conditions, through
    repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global
    Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the
    liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider
    the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other
    restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among
    entities.

Our global excess liquidity sources increased $122 billion
    to $336 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to
    $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained
    as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily
    to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through deposit
    growth, loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and
    other factors.

Table
    16   Global
    Excess Liquidity Sources  

As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent
    company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered
    securities and totaled $121 billion and $99 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Typically, parent company cash
    is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A.

Our bank subsidiaries  excess liquidity sources at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $180 billion and
    $89 billion. These amounts are distinct from the cash
    deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition
    to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold
    significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we
    believe could also be used to generate liquidity, such as
    investment-grade ABS, MBS and municipal bonds. Another way our
    bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by
    pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to
    certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount
    Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against
    this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was
    approximately $170 billion and $187 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have established operational
    procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets,
    including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans
    and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions,
    liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to
    fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and cannot be
    transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries.

Our broker/dealer subsidiaries  excess liquidity sources at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of $35 billion
    and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid,
    unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held

significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe
    could also be used to generate additional liquidity, including
    investment-grade corporate securities and equities. Liquidity
    held in a broker/dealer subsidiary is only available to meet the
    obligations of that entity and cannot be transferred to the
    parent company or to any other subsidiary, often due to
    regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.

Time to Required
    Funding and Stress Modeling  

We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts
    of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our
    bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to
    evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent
    company is  Time to Required Funding.  This debt
    coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent
    company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual
    obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess
    Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any
    additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual
    obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior
    or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America
    Corporation or Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc., including
    certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes,
    which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity.
    The ALMRC has established a target for Time to Required Funding
    of 21 months. Time to Required Funding was 24 months
    at December 31, 2010 compared to 25 months at
    December 31, 2009.

We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining
    the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the
    parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries.
    These risk sensitive models have become increasingly important
    in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash
    outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to
    Required Funding analysis.

We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of
    scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons.
    These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific
    events, including potential credit ratings downgrades for the
    parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize
    scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance,
    and both expected and unexpected future events.

The types of contractual and contingent cash outflows we
    consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to:
    upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions
    in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing
    markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of
    maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan
    commitments and liquidity facilities; additional collateral that
    counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded;
    collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising
    from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain
    businesses and finance customer activities.

We consider all sources of funds that we could access during
    each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching
    available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by
    legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage
    our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines
    on certain funding sources and businesses.

Basel III
    Liquidity Standards  

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision issued
     International framework for liquidity risk measurement,
    standards and monitoring,  which includes two measures of
    liquidity risk. These two minimum liquidity measures were
    initially introduced in guidance in December 2009 and are
    considered part of Basel III.

The first liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio
    (LCR) which identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality
    liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be used to
    offset the net cash outflows the institution would encounter
    under an acute
     30-day 
    stress scenario. The second

68        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) which
    measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding
    employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity
    profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent
    calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet
    commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel
    Committee expects the LCR to be implemented in January 2015 and
    the NSFR in January 2018, following observation periods
    beginning in 2012. We continue to monitor the development and
    the potential impact of these evolving proposals and expect to
    be able to meet the final requirements.

Diversified
    Funding Sources  

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured
    and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding
    strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products,
    programs, markets, currencies and investor bases.

We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through
    our deposit base which was $1.0 trillion and $992 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Deposits are primarily
    generated by our  Deposits, Global Commercial Banking, GWIM
     and  GBAM  segments. These deposits are diversified by
    clients, product type and geography. Certain of our
    U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a
    substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and
    consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is
    generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market
    volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale
    funding sources.

Certain consumer lending activities, primarily in our banking
    subsidiaries, may be funded through securitizations. Included in
    these consumer lending activities are the extension of mortgage,
    credit card, auto loans, home equity loans and lines of credit.
    If securitization markets are not available to us on favorable
    terms, we typically finance these loans with deposits or with
    wholesale borrowings. For additional information on
    securitizations, see  Note 8   Securitizations
    and Other Variable Interest Entities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Our trading activities are primarily funded on a secured basis
    through securities lending and repurchase agreements; these
    amounts will vary based on customer activity and market
    conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured
    financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to
    changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing.
    Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often
    overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for
    financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles
    which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant
    reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the
    liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding
    globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a
    range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,
    when appropriate.

Unsecured debt, both short- and long-term, is also an important
    source of funding. We may issue unsecured debt through
    syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered
    and unregistered medium-term note programs,
     non-U.S. medium-term 
    note programs,
     non-U.S. private 
    placements, U.S. and
     non-U.S. commercial 
    paper and through other methods. We distribute a significant
    portion of our debt offerings through our retail and
    institutional sales forces to a large, diversified global
    investor base. Maintaining relationships with our investors is
    an important aspect of our funding strategy. We may, from time
    to time, purchase outstanding Bank of America Corporation debt
    securities in various transactions, depending upon prevailing
    market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, we
    may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide
    liquidity for investors.

In addition, our parent company, bank and broker-dealer
    subsidiaries regularly access short-term secured and unsecured
    markets through federal funds purchased, commercial paper and
    other short-term borrowings to

support customer activities, short-term financing requirements
    and cash management.

At December 31, 2010, commercial paper and other short-term
    borrowings included $6.7 billion of VIEs that were
    consolidated in accordance with new consolidation guidance
    effective January 1, 2010. For average and year-end balance
    discussions, see Balance Sheet Overview beginning on
    page 29. For more information, see
     Note 12     Federal Funds Sold,
    Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and
    Short-term Borrowings  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the
    parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During 2010, the parent
    company and Bank of America, N.A. issued $28.8 billion and
    $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt.

We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and
    currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an
    appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of
    unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market
    conditions or by matters specific to the financial services
    industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing
    risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we
    anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.

The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include
    greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition
    by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable
    funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time
    zone differences or other business considerations make parent
    company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may
    issue their own debt.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our long-term debt was in
    the currencies presented in the table below.

Table
    17   Long-term
    Debt By Major Currency  

At December 31, 2010, the above table includes
    $71.0 billion of primarily U.S. Dollar long-term debt
    of VIEs that were consolidated in accordance with new
    consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010.

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest
    rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the
    characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further
    details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk
    Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 103.

We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types
    of debt instruments including structured notes, which are debt
    obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt
    or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We
    typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these
    notes with derivative positions
     and/or  in
    the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective,
    the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We
    could be required to immediately settle certain structured note
    obligations for cash or other securities under certain
    circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning
    purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings
    will remain outstanding beyond the

Bank of America
    2010        69  

Table of Contents   

earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured
    notes of $61.1 billion and $57.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt
    obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a
    requirement for an early repayment, require additional
    collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate
    maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an
    adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios,
    earnings, cash flows or stock price.

We participated in the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program (TLGP) which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt
    that the FDIC guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount
    and maturity of the debt. At December 31, 2010, we had
    $27.5 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer
    issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under
    TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. Under this program, our
    debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major
    credit ratings agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of
    issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term
    debt. The associated FDIC fee for the 2009 issuances was
    $554 million and is being amortized into expense over the
    stated term of the debt.

For additional information on debt funding, see
     Note 13   Long-term Debt  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingency
    Planning  

We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential
    responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of
    severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios
    and include potential funding strategies, and communication and
    notification procedures that we would implement in the event we
    experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically
    review and test the contingency funding plans to validate
    efficacy and assess readiness.

Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding
    through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain
     non-U.S. subsidiaries 
    have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in
    which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our
    liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and
    governance processes that would enable us to access these
    sources if necessary.

Credit
    Ratings  

Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly
    impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may
    be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in
    certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain
    transactions including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our
    objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings.

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness
    and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term
    debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other
    securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings
    are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus
    may change from time to time based on a number of factors,
    including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and
    operations as well as factors not under our control, such as
    ratings agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry
    or certain security types, which are subject to revision from
    time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services
    industry generally. In light of the recent difficulties in the
    financial services industry and financial markets, there can be
    no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings.

During 2009 and 2010, the ratings agencies took numerous
    actions, many of which were negative, to adjust our credit
    ratings and the outlooks for those ratings. Currently, Bank of
    America Corporation s long-term senior debt

and outlook expressed by the ratings agencies are as follows: A2
    (negative) by Moody s Investors Services, Inc.
    (Moody s), A (negative) by Standard and Poor s Ratings
    Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
    (S P), and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by Fitch, Inc.
    (Fitch). Bank of America, N.A. s long-term debt and outlook
    currently are as follows: A+ (negative), Aa3 (negative) and A+
    (Rating Watch Negative) by those same three credit ratings
    agencies, respectively. The ratings agencies have indicated
    that, as a systemically important financial institution, our
    credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if
    necessary, we would receive significant support from the
    U.S. government. All three ratings agencies, however, have
    indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they
    include in our ratings for government support for reasons
    arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or
    legislation. In February 2010, S P affirmed our current
    credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable
    based on its belief that it is less certain whether the
    U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary
    support. On July 27, 2010, Moody s affirmed our
    current ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable
    due to its expectation for lower levels of government support
    over time as a result of the passage of the Financial Reform
    Act. Also, on October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit
    ratings on Rating Watch Negative from stable outlook due to
    proposed rulemaking that could negatively impact its assessment
    of future systemic government support. Other factors that
    influence our credit ratings include changes to the ratings
    agencies  methodologies, the ratings agencies 
    assessment of the general operating environment, our relative
    positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation,
    liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, the level and
    volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management
    policies, capital position, capital management practices and
    current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.

A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of
    certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have a
    material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit
    markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on
    certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where
    counterparty creditworthiness is critical. Under the terms of
    certain OTC derivatives contracts and other trading agreements,
    in the event of a credit ratings downgrade, the counterparties
    to those agreements may require us to provide additional
    collateral or to terminate these contracts or agreements. Such
    collateral calls or terminations could cause us to sustain
    losses, impair our liquidity, or both, by requiring us to
    provide the counterparties with additional collateral in the
    form of cash or highly liquid securities. If Bank of America
    Corporation s or Bank of America, N.A. s commercial
    paper or short-term credit ratings (which currently have the
    following ratings:
     P-1  by
    Moody s,
     A-1  by
    S P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more
    levels, the potential loss of short-term funding sources such as
    commercial paper or repo financing and effect on our incremental
    cost of funds would be material. For information regarding the
    additional collateral and termination payments that would be
    required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and
    other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings
    downgrade, see  Note 4   Derivatives  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. from
    the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of
    Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies
    have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch s
    credit ratings are Bank of America Corporation s credit
    ratings.

Credit
    Risk Management  

Credit quality continued to show improvement during 2010;
    although, net charge-offs, and nonperforming loans, leases and
    foreclosed properties remained elevated. Signs of economic
    stability and our proactive credit risk management initiatives
    positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and
    delinquencies continued to improve across almost all portfolios
    along with risk rating improvements in the commercial portfolio.
    Global and national economic uncertainty, regulatory initiatives
    and reform, however, continued to weigh on the credit portfolios
    through December 31, 2010. For more information, see 2010
    Economic and Business Environment on page 25. Credit
    metrics were also impacted by loans added to the balance sheet
    on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption of new
    consolidation guidance.

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a
    borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk
    can also arise from operational failures that result in an
    erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define
    the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss
    potential arising from all product classifications including
    loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets
     held-for-sale 
    and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments,
    letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions
    are recorded at fair value and assets
     held-for-sale 
    are recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.
    Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under
    the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of
    assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit
    losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in
    earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured
    as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with
    contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform
    under the terms of those contracts. We use the current
     mark-to-market 
    value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration
    to future
     mark-to-market 
    changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the
    effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and
    cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension
    and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded
    credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and
    credit extension commitments, see  Note 4  
    Derivatives  and  Note 14   Commitments and
    Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower
    or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying
    collateral, and other support given current events, conditions
    and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer
    or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.

We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management
    practices, as well as credit standards, to meet the changing
    economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance
    customer support in our consumer businesses, we have expanded
    collections, loan modification and customer assistance
    infrastructures. We also have implemented a number of actions to
    mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including
    increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,
    hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of
    deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset
    officers as credits approach criticized levels.

Since January 2008, and through 2010, Bank of America and
    Countrywide have completed nearly 775,000 loan modifications
    with customers. During 2010, we completed nearly 285,000
    customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal
    balance of approximately $65.7 billion, which included
    109,000 customers who converted from trial period to permanent
    modifications under the government s MHA program. Of the
    loan modifications

completed in 2010, in terms of both the volume of modifications
    and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying
    loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and
    were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of
    modifications during the year include a combination of rate
    reduction and capitalization of past due amounts which represent
    68 percent of the volume of modifications completed in
    2010, while principal forbearance represented 15 percent
    and capitalization of past due amounts represented nine percent.
    We also provide rate reductions, rate and payment extensions,
    principal forgiveness and other actions. These modification
    types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings
    (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see
    Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity
    beginning on page 81 and  Note 6  
    Outstanding Loans and Leases  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking
    residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in
    judicial states. On October 8, 2010, we stopped foreclosure
    sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of the
    related business processes. As a result of that assessment, we
    identified and began implementing process and control
    enhancements and we intend to monitor ongoing quality results of
    each process. After these enhancements were put in place, we
    resumed foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the
    fourth quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the
    remaining non-judicial states in the first quarter of 2011. The
    process of preparing affidavits in pending proceedings in
    judicial states is expected to continue into the first quarter
    of 2011 and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings that
    delay certain foreclosure sales. We took these precautionary
    steps in order to ensure our processes for handling foreclosures
    include the appropriate controls and quality assurance. These
    initiatives further support our credit risk management and
    mitigation efforts. For more information, see Recent Events
    beginning on page 33.

Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,
    Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of
    financial stress. Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt
    crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the financial
    markets which could have a detrimental impact on the global
    economic recovery, including the impact of non-sovereign debt in
    these countries. For more information on our direct sovereign
    and non-sovereign exposures in these countries, see
     Non-U.S. Portfolio 
    beginning on page 94.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new
    disclosure guidance, effective on a prospective basis for the
    Corporation s 2010 year-end reporting, that addresses
    disclosure of loans and other financing receivables and the
    related allowance. The new disclosure guidance defines a
    portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and
    documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance
    for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables as the
    level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the
    initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods
    for assessing risk. The Corporation s portfolio segments
    are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial.
    The classes within the home loans portfolio segment are
    residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate.
    The classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio
    segment are U.S. credit card,
     non-U.S. credit 
    card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes
    within the commercial portfolio segment are
    U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease
    financing,
     non-U.S. commercial 
    and U.S. small business commercial. Under this new
    disclosure guidance, the allowance is presented by portfolio
    segment.

Consumer
    Portfolio Credit Risk Management  

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with
    initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower s
    credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with
    experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio
    management including underwriting, product pricing, risk
    appetite, setting credit limits and establishing operating
    processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns.
    Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral
    information from external sources such as credit bureaus
     and/or 
    internal historical experience. These models are a component of
    our consumer credit risk management process and are used, in
    part, to help determine both new and existing credit decisions,
    portfolio management strategies including authorizations and
    line management, collection practices and strategies,
    determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and
    economic capital allocations for credit risk.

For information on our accounting policies regarding
    delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for
    the consumer portfolio, see  Note 1   Summary
    of Significant Accounting Principles  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Consumer Credit
    Portfolio  

Although unemployment rates remained at elevated levels,
    improvement in the U.S. economy and stabilization in the
    labor markets during 2010 resulted in lower losses and lower
    delinquencies in almost all consumer portfolios during 2010 when
    compared to 2009 on a managed basis. However, economic
    deterioration throughout 2009 and weakness in the economic
    recovery in 2010 drove continued stress in the housing markets
    and tighter availability of credit in the market place resulting
    in elevated net charge-offs in most portfolios. In addition,
    during 2010, our consumer real estate portfolios were impacted
    by net charge-offs on certain modified loans deemed to be
    collateral dependent pursuant to clarification of regulatory
    guidance. For more

information on regulatory guidance on collateral dependent
    modified loans, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56.

Under the new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all
    previously off-balance sheet securitized credit card receivables
    along with certain home equity and auto loan securitization
    trusts. The 2010 consumer credit card credit quality statistics
    include the impact of consolidation of VIEs. The following
    tables include the December 31, 2009 balances as well as
    the January 1, 2010 balances to show the impact of the
    adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, the
    December 31, 2010 credit quality statistics under the new
    consolidation guidance should be compared to the amounts
    presented in the January 1, 2010 column.

The table below presents our outstanding consumer loans and the
    Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from
    Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were written down to
    fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in
    the  Outstandings  columns in the table below, these
    loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting
    adjustments, in the  Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired
    Loan Portfolio  column. Loans that were acquired from
    Merrill Lynch were recorded at fair value including those that
    were considered credit-impaired upon acquisition. The Merrill
    Lynch consumer PCI loan portfolio did not materially alter the
    reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios
    and is, therefore, excluded from the  Countrywide Purchased
    Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio  column and the following
    discussion. For additional information, see
     Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases  to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the
    Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is
    reported where appropriate. See Countrywide Purchased
    Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on page 78 for
    more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were
    originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon
    acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or
    subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are
    now included in the residential mortgage portfolio shown below.

The table below presents our accruing consumer loans past due
    90 days or more and our consumer nonperforming loans.
    Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card
    loans, consumer non-real estate-secured loans or unsecured
    consumer loans as these loans are generally charged off no later
    than the end of the month in which the loan becomes
    180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer
    loans insured by the FHA are reported as accruing as opposed to
    nonperforming since the

principal repayment is insured by the FHA. FHA insured loans
    accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to
    our purchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing
    agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and
    accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include
    the Countrywide PCI loans even though the customer may be
    contractually past due.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009,

    or interest has been curtailed by the FHA although principal is
    still insured and $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion of
    loans that were still accruing interest. Our policy is to
    classify delinquent consumer loans secured by real estate and
    insured by the FHA as accruing past due 90 days or more.

Accruing consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more

Residential
    Mortgage  

The residential mortgage portfolio, which excludes the
    discontinued real estate portfolio acquired with Countrywide,
    makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio
    at 40 percent of consumer loans at December 31, 2010.
    Approximately 14 percent of the residential mortgage
    portfolio is in  GWIM  and represents residential mortgages
    that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs
    of our affluent clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio
    is mostly in  All Other  and is comprised of both
    residential loans originated for our customers and used in our
    overall ALM activities as well as purchased loans.

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio
    increased $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared
    to December 31, 2009 as new FHA insured origination volume
    was partially offset by paydowns, the sale

of First Republic, transfers to foreclosed properties and
    charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans
    pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased
    the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the residential mortgage
    portfolio included $53.9 billion and $12.9 billion of
    outstanding loans that were insured by the FHA. On this portion
    of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against
    principal loss as a result of FHA insurance. The table below
    presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on
    both a reported basis and excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA
    insured loan portfolios. We believe the presentation of
    information adjusted to exclude the impacts of the Countrywide
    PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios is more representative of
    the credit risk in this portfolio. For more information on the
    Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see the discussion beginning on
    page 78.

    Mortgage   Key Credit Statistics

The following discussion presents the residential mortgage
    portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan
    portfolios.

We have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the
    residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic
    securitization vehicles and long-term standby agreements with
    FNMA and FHLMC as described in  Note 6  
    Outstanding Loans and Leases  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the synthetic
    securitization vehicles referenced $53.9 billion and
    $70.7 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided
    loss protection up to $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had a
    receivable of $722 million and $1.0 billion from these
    vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an
    allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic
    securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the
    residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of
    amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the
    benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic
    securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio
    for 2010 would have been reduced by seven bps compared to
    27 bps for 2009. Synthetic securitizations and the
    protection provided by FNMA and FHLMC together mitigated risk on
    35 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These credit protection
    agreements reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the
    transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated
    parties. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, these transactions
    had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets
    by $8.6 billion and $16.8 billion, and increased our
    Tier 1 capital ratio by seven bps and 11 bps and our
    Tier 1 common capital ratio by five bps and eight bps. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, $14.3 billion and
    $6.6 billion in loans were protected by long-term standby
    agreements. The Corporation does not record an allowance for
    credit losses on loans protected by these long-term standby
    agreements.

Nonperforming residential mortgage loans increased
    $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 as new
    inflows, which continued to slow in 2010 due to favorable
    delinquency trends, continued to outpace nonperforming loans
    returning to performing status, charge-offs, and paydowns and
    payoffs. At December 31, 2010, $12.7 billion, or
    72 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans
    were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to
    the fair value of the underlying collateral. Net charge-offs
    decreased $680 million to $3.7 billion in 2010, or
    1.79 percent of total average residential mortgage loans
    compared to 1.83 percent for 2009 driven primarily by
    favorable delinquency trends which were due in part to
    improvement in the U.S. economy. Net charge-off ratios were
    further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to
    paydowns, the sale of First Republic and charge-offs.

Certain risk characteristics of the residential mortgage
    portfolio continued to contribute to higher losses. These
    characteristics include loans with a high refreshed
     loan-to-value 
    (LTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and
    2007, loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where
    we have concentrations and where significant declines in home
    prices have been experienced, as well as interest-only loans.
    Although the following disclosures address each of these risk
    characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in
    loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a
    disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The
    residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk
    characteristics comprised five percent and seven percent of the
    residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, but accounted for 26 percent of the residential
    mortgage net charge-offs in 2010 compared to 31 percent in
    2009.

Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent
    but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented
    10 percent and 11 percent of the residential mortgage
    portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with a
    refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented
    23 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at
    both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the loans with a
    refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 88 percent
    were performing at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans
    with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans
    where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than
    the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The
    majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than
    100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration from
    the weakened economy. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO
    scores below 620 represented 14 percent and 12 percent
    of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010
    and 2009.

The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represented
    38 percent and 42 percent of our residential mortgage
    portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher
    refreshed LTVs and accounted for 67 percent and
    69 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These vintages of loans
    accounted for 77 percent of residential mortgage net
    charge-offs during 2010 and 75 percent during 2009.

The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and
    net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the
    residential mortgage portfolio. California and Florida combined
    represented 42 percent of outstandings and 48 percent
    of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. These states
    accounted for 54 percent of the net charge-offs for 2010
    compared to 58 percent for 2009. The Los Angeles-Long
    Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within
    California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, but comprised only seven
    percent of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009.

Of the residential mortgage loans, $62.5 billion, or
    32 percent, at December 31, 2010 are interest-only
    loans of which 87 percent were performing. Nonperforming
    balances on interest-only residential mortgage loans were
    $8.0 billion, or 45 percent of total nonperforming
    residential mortgages. Additionally, net charge-offs on the
    interest-only portion of the portfolio represented
    53 percent of the total residential mortgage net
    charge-offs during 2010.

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet
    the credit needs of their communities for housing and other
    purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate
    incomes. At December 31, 2010, our CRA portfolio was eight
    percent of the residential mortgage loan balances but comprised
    17 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans.
    This portfolio also represented 23 percent of residential
    mortgage net charge-offs during 2010.

Home
    Equity  

The home equity portfolio makes up 21 percent of the
    consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of
    credit, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At
    December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent of the
    home equity portfolio was included in  Home Loans  
    Insurance , while the remainder of the portfolio was
    primarily in  GWIM.  Outstanding balances in the home
    equity portfolio decreased $11.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due to
    charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic, partially
    offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, which
    resulted in the consolidation of $5.1 billion of home
    equity loans on January 1, 2010. Of the loans in the home
    equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    $24.8 billion and $26.0 billion, or 18 percent
    for both periods, were in first-lien positions (20 percent
    and 19 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity
    loan portfolio). For more information on the Countrywide PCI
    home equity loan portfolio, see the discussion beginning on
    page 78.

Home equity unused lines of credit totaled $80.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010 compared to $92.7 billion at
    December 31, 2009. This decrease was due primarily to
    account attrition as well as line management initiatives on
    deteriorating accounts and the sale of First Republic, which
    more than offset new production. The home equity line of credit
    utilization rate was 59 percent at December 31, 2010
    compared to 57 percent at December 31, 2009.

The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio
    excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio.

Nonperforming home equity loans decreased $1.1 billion to
    $2.7 billion compared to December 31, 2009 driven
    primarily by charge-offs, including those recorded in connection
    with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on
    collateral dependent modified loans, and nonperforming loans
    returning to performing status which together outpaced
    delinquency inflows and the impact of the adoption of new
    consolidation guidance. At December 31, 2010,
    $916 million, or 34 percent, of the nonperforming home
    equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been
    written down to their fair values. Net charge-offs decreased
    $269 million to $6.8 billion, or 5.10 percent, of
    total average home equity loans for 2010 compared to
    $7.1 billion, or 5.00 percent, for 2009. The decrease
    was primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part
    to improvement in the U.S. economy. This was partially
    offset by $822 million of net charge-offs related to the
    implementation of regulatory guidance on collateral dependent
    modified loans and $463 million of net charge-offs related
    to home equity loans that were consolidated on January 1,
    2010 under new consolidation guidance. Net charge-off ratios
    were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily as a
    result of charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic.

There are certain risk characteristics of the home equity
    portfolio which have contributed to higher losses including
    loans with a high refreshed combined
     loan-to-value 
    (CLTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and
    2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the
    most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines
    coupled with the fact that most home equity loans are secured by
    second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some
    cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of
    the first-lien position. Although the following disclosures
    address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is
    significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which
    has contributed to a

disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Home equity
    loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised
    10 percent and 11 percent of the total home equity
    portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, but have accounted
    for 29 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2010
    compared to 38 percent in 2009.

Home equity loans with greater than 90 percent but less
    than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 11 percent
    and 12 percent of the home equity portfolio at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with refreshed CLTVs
    greater than 100 percent comprised 30 percent and
    31 percent of the home equity portfolio at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of those loans with a refreshed
    CLTV greater than 100 percent, 97 percent were
    performing at December 31, 2010 while 95 percent were
    performing at December 31, 2009. Home equity loans and
    lines of credit with a refreshed CLTV greater than
    100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and
    available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or
    greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing
    the loan. Depending on the LTV of the first lien, there may be
    collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to
    reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. The majority of
    these high refreshed CLTV ratios are due to home price declines.
    In addition, loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score
    below 620 represented 12 percent and 13 percent of the
    home equity loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the
    total home equity portfolio, 75 percent and 72 percent
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were interest-only loans.

The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represent 47 percent
    and 49 percent of our home equity portfolio at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher refreshed CLTVs and
    accounted for 57 percent of nonperforming home equity loans
    at December 31, 2010 compared to 62 percent at
    December 31, 2009. These vintages of loans accounted for
    66 percent of net charge-offs in 2010 compared to
    72 percent in 2009.

    compared to 60 percent of the home equity net charge-offs

    MSA comprised only six percent

of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009. The Los Angeles-Long

Discontinued Real
    Estate  

The discontinued real estate portfolio, totaling
    $13.1 billion at December 31, 2010, consisted of pay
    option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide
    acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued
    real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written
    down to fair value. At December 31, 2010, the Countrywide
    PCI loan portfolio comprised $11.7 billion, or
    89 percent, of the total discontinued real estate
    portfolio. This portfolio is included in  All Other  and is
    managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See Countrywide
    Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on
    page 78 for more information on the discontinued real
    estate portfolio.

At December 31, 2010, the purchased discontinued real
    estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was
    $1.4 billion. Loans with greater than 90 percent
    refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 29 percent of the
    portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620
    represented 46 percent of the portfolio. California
    represented 37 percent of the portfolio and 34 percent
    of the nonperforming loans while Florida represented
    10 percent of the portfolio and 15 percent of the
    nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. The Los
    Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up
    16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at
    December 31, 2010.

Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included
    in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates
    that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust
    annually, subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments
    are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual
    payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum
    change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to
    repay a loan, the fully amortizing loan payment amount is
    re-established after the initial five or
     10-year 
    period and again every five years thereafter. These payment
    adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and
    may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the
    addition of unpaid interest to the loan

balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are
    fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject
    to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest
    limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan s
    principal balance to reach a certain level within the first
    10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to
    the interest-only payment; then at the
     10-year 
    point, the fully amortizing payment is required.

The difference between the frequency of changes in the
    loans  interest rates and payments along with a limitation
    on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent
    per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay
    all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative
    amortization). Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan
    balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit,
    which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan
    amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to
    repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is
    established.

At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of pay
    option loans was $14.6 billion, with a carrying amount of
    $11.8 billion, including $11.0 billion of loans that
    were credit-impaired upon acquisition. The total unpaid
    principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative
    amortization was $12.5 billion including $858 million
    of negative amortization. The percentage of borrowers electing
    to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was
    69 percent at December 31, 2010. We continue to
    evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired
    negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay
    option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several
    assumptions regarding this evaluation (e.g., prepayment rates).
    Based on our expectations, 11 percent and three percent of
    the pay option loan portfolio are expected to reset in 2011 and
    2012. Approximately four percent are expected to reset
    thereafter and approximately 82 percent are expected to
    default or repay prior to being reset.

Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration
    since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that
    we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments
    are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans,
    which addresses accounting for differences between contractual
    and expected cash flows to be collected from the
    purchaser s initial investment in loans if those
    differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit
    quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the
    acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status,
    refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded
    at fair value upon acquisition and

the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or
    recording valuation allowances in the initial accounting. The
    Merrill Lynch PCI consumer loan portfolio did not materially
    alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer
    portfolios. As such, the Merrill Lynch consumer PCI loans are
    excluded from the following discussion and credit statistics.

Acquired loans from Countrywide that were considered
    credit-impaired were written down to fair value at the
    acquisition date. The following table presents the unpaid
    principal balance, carrying value, allowance for loan and lease
    losses and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid

Of the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2010,
    $15.5 billion was 180 days or more past due, including
    $10.9 billion of first-lien and $4.6 billion of home
    equity. Of the $25.9 billion that is less than
    180 days past due, $21.5 billion, or 83 percent
    of the total unpaid principal balance, was current based on the
    contractual terms while $2.2 billion, or eight percent, was
    in early stage delinquency. During 2010, we recorded
    $2.3 billion of provision for credit losses on PCI loans
    which was comprised mainly of $1.4 billion for home equity
    and $689 million for discontinued real estate loans
    compared to a total provision for PCI loans of $3.3 billion
    in 2009. Provision expense in 2010 was driven primarily by a
    slower pace of expected recovery in home prices, the result of a
    deteriorating view on defaults on more seasoned loans in the
    portfolio and a reassessment of modification and short sale
    benefits as we gain more experience with troubled borrowers. The
    Countrywide PCI allowance for loan losses increased
    $2.5 billion from December 31, 2009 to
    $6.3 billion at December 31, 2010 as a result of the
    increase in the provision for credit losses and the
    reclassification of a portion of nonaccretable difference to the
    allowance. For further information on the PCI loan portfolio,
    see  Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S. Credit
    Card  

Prior to the adoption of new consolidation guidance, the
    U.S. credit card portfolio was reported on both a held and
    managed basis. Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were
    not sold into credit card securitizations and presented credit
    quality information as if the loans had not been sold. Under the
    new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, we
    consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and the new
    held basis is comparable to the previously reported managed
    basis. For more information on the adoption of the new
    consolidation guidance, see
     Note 8   Securitizations and Other
    Variable Interest Entities  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The consumer U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in
     Global Card Services . Outstandings in the
    U.S. credit card loan portfolio increased
    $64.3 billion compared to December 31, 2009 due to the
    adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Compared to 2009,
    net charge-offs increased $6.5 billion to
    $13.0 billion also due to the adoption of the new
    consolidation guidance. U.S. credit card loans 30 days
    or more past due and still accruing interest increased
    $2.0 billion while loans 90 days or more past due and
    still accruing interest increased $1.2 billion compared to
    December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of new consolidation
    guidance.

Compared to December 31, 2009 on a managed basis,
    outstandings decreased $15.9 billion primarily as a result
    of charge-offs and lower origination volume. Net losses
    decreased $3.9 billion due to lower levels of delinquencies
    and bankruptcies as a result of improvement in the
    U.S. economy compared to 2009 on a managed basis. The net
    charge-off ratio was 11.04 percent of total average
    U.S. credit card loans in 2010 compared to
    12.07 percent in 2009 on a managed basis. U.S. credit
    card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing
    interest decreased $4.0 billion and loans 90 days or
    more past due and still accruing interest decreased
    $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 on a
    managed basis. These declines were due to improvement in the
    U.S. economy including stabilization in the levels of
    unemployment.

    $438.5 billion at December 31, 2009 on a managed
    basis. The $38.8 billion decrease was driven by a
    combination of account management initiatives on higher risk or
    inactive accounts and tighter underwriting standards for new
    originations.

Non-U.S.

Prior to the adoption of new consolidation guidance, the

    card portfolio was reported on both a held and managed basis.
    Under the new consolidation guidance effective January 1,
    2010, we consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and

The consumer
     non-U.S. credit 
    card portfolio is managed in  Global Card Services .
    Outstandings in the
     non-U.S. credit 
    card portfolio increased $5.8 billion compared to
    December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of the new
    consolidation guidance. Additionally, net charge-off levels and
    ratios for 2010, when compared to 2009, were impacted by the
    adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Net charge-offs
    increased $1.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2010.

Outstandings declined $3.7 billion compared to
    December 31, 2009 on a managed basis primarily due to
    charge-offs, lower origination volume and the strengthening of
    the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Net
    losses

were substantially flat for 2010, decreasing $16 million
    from managed losses in 2009. The net loss ratio increased to
    7.88 percent of total average
     non-U.S. credit 
    card compared to 7.43 percent in 2009, due to the decrease
    in outstandings.

Unused lines of credit for
     non-U.S. credit 
    card totaled $60.3 billion at December 31, 2010
    compared to $69.6 billion at December 31, 2009 on a
    managed basis. The $9.3 billion decrease was driven by the
    combination of account management initiatives on inactive
    accounts, tighter underwriting standards for new originations
    and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain
    foreign currencies, particularly the British Pound and the Euro.

Direct/Indirect
    Consumer  

At December 31, 2010, approximately 48 percent of the
    direct/indirect portfolio was included in  Global Commercial
    Banking  (dealer financial services   automotive,
    marine and recreational vehicle loans), 29 percent was
    included in  GWIM  (principally other non-real
    estate-secured, unsecured personal loans and securities-based
    lending margin loans), 15 percent was included in  Global
    Card Services  (consumer personal loans and other non-real
    estate-secured loans) and the remainder was in  All Other
     (student loans).

Outstanding loans and leases decreased $6.9 billion to
    $90.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to
    December 31, 2009 as lower outstandings in the  Global
    Card Services  unsecured consumer lending portfolio and the
    sale of a portion of the student loan portfolio were partially
    offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, growth in
    securities-based lending and the purchase of auto receivables
    within the dealer financial services portfolio. Direct/indirect
    loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing
    interest declined $1.1 billion compared to
    December 31, 2009, to $2.6 billion due to a
    combination of reduced outstandings and improvement in the
    unsecured consumer lending portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased
    $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion in 2010, or
    3.45 percent of total average direct/indirect loans
    compared to 5.46 percent in 2009. This decrease was
    primarily driven by reduced outstandings from changes in
    underwriting criteria and lower levels of delinquencies and
    bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a
    result of improvement in the U.S. economy including
    stabilization in the levels of unemployment. An additional
    driver was lower net charge-offs in the dealer financial
    services portfolio due to the impact of higher credit quality
    originations and higher resale values. Net charge-offs for the
    unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $1.6 billion
    to $2.7 billion and the net charge-off ratio decreased to
    16.74 percent in 2010 compared to 17.75 percent in
    2009. Net charge-offs for the dealer financial services
    portfolio decreased $404 million to $487 million and
    the loss rate decreased to 1.08 percent in 2010 compared to
    2.16 percent in 2009.

Other
    Consumer  

At December 31, 2010, approximately 69 percent of the
    $2.8 billion other consumer portfolio was associated with
    portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we
    previously exited and is included in  All Other . The
    remainder consisted of the
     non-U.S. consumer 
    loan portfolio, of which the vast majority we previously exited
    and is largely in  Global Card Services  and deposit
    overdrafts which are recorded in  Deposits. 

Nonperforming
    Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity  

Table 33 presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed
    properties activity during 2010 and 2009. Nonperforming LHFS are
    excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either
    fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming
    loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans and in
    general, past due consumer loans not secured by real estate as
    these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of
    the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real
    estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are
    not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured
    by the FHA. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the
    Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. For further information
    regarding nonperforming loans, see  Note 1  
    Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonperforming loans remained
    relatively flat at $20.9 billion at December 31, 2010
    compared to $20.8 billion at December 31, 2009 as
    delinquency inflows to nonaccrual loans slowed driven by
    favorable portfolio trends due in part to the improving
    U.S. economy. These inflows were offset by charge-offs,
    nonperforming loans returning to performing status, and paydowns
    and payoffs.

The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in
    excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the
    property value for costs to sell, is charged off no later than
    the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days
    past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA. At
    December 31, 2010, $15.1 billion, or 69 percent,
    of the nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed
    properties had been written down to their fair values. This was
    comprised of $13.9 billion of nonperforming loans
    180 days or more past due and $1.2 billion of
    foreclosed properties.

Foreclosed properties decreased $179 million in 2010. PCI
    loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were
    written down to fair value at the acquisition date. However,
    once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation
    upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in
    foreclosed properties. Net changes to foreclosed properties
    related to PCI loans were an increase of $100 million in
    2010. Not included in foreclosed properties at December 31,
    2010 was $1.4 billion of real estate that was acquired by
    the Corporation upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA insured
    loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we
    convey

these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our
    nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we
    will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for
    principal and up to certain limits, costs incurred during the
    foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding
    period.

Restructured
    Loans   

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been
    modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to
    borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions
    typically result from the Corporation s loss mitigation
    activities and could include reductions in the interest rate,
    payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or
    other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at
    the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing
    status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment
    performance under revised payment terms for a reasonable period,
    generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those
    modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are
    included in Table 33.

Residential mortgage TDRs totaled $11.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010, an increase of $4.6 billion
    compared to December 31, 2009. Of these loans,
    $3.3 billion were nonperforming representing an increase of
    $130 million in 2010, and $8.5 billion were performing
    representing an increase of $4.5 billion in 2010 driven by
    TDRs returning to performing status and new additions. These
    performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table
    33. Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent
    totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and included
    $921 million of loans classified as nonperforming and
    $2.3 billion classified as performing. At December 31,
    2010, performing residential mortgage TDRs included
    $2.5 billion that were FHA insured.

Home equity TDRs totaled $1.7 billion at December 31,
    2010, a decrease of $673 million compared to
    December 31, 2009. Of these loans, $541 million were
    nonperforming representing a decrease of $1.2 billion in
    2010 driven primarily by nonperforming TDRs returning to
    performing status and charge-offs taken to comply with
    regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on
    collateral dependent modified loans. Home equity TDRs that were
    performing in accordance with their modified terms were
    $1.2 billion representing an increase of $514 million
    in 2010. These performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming
    loans in Table 33. Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent
    totaled $796 million at December 31, 2010 and included
    $245 million of loans classified as nonperforming and
    $551 million classified as performing.

Discontinued real estate TDRs totaled $395 million at
    December 31, 2010, an increase of $13 million in 2010.
    Of these loans, $206 million were nonperforming while the
    remaining $189 million were classified as

Bank of America
    2010        81  

Table of Contents   

performing at December 31, 2010. Discontinued real estate
    TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $213 million at
    December 31, 2010 and included $97 million of loans
    classified as nonperforming and $116 million classified as
    performing.

We also work with customers that are experiencing financial
    difficulty by renegotiating credit card, consumer lending and
    small business loans (the renegotiated TDR portfolio), while
    complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination
    Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all renegotiated
    portfolio modifications are considered to be TDRs. The
    renegotiated TDR portfolio may include modifications, both
    short- and long-term, of interest rates or payment amounts or a
    combination of interest rates and payment amounts. We make
    modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs
    utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external
    renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is
    excluded from Table 33 as we do not generally classify consumer
    non-real estate loans as nonperforming. At December 31,
    2010, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $12.1 billion of
    which $9.2 billion was current or less than 30 days
    past due under the modified terms, compared to an
    $8.1 billion portfolio, on a held basis at
    December 31, 2009, of which $5.9 billion was current
    or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. At
    December 31, 2009, our renegotiated

TDR portfolio, on a managed basis, was $15.8 billion of
    which $11.5 billion was current or less than 30 days
    past due under the modified terms. For more information on the
    renegotiated TDR portfolio, see  Note 6  
    Outstanding Loans and Leases  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

As a result of new accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning
    January 1, 2010, modifications of loans in the PCI loan
    portfolio do not result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan
    pool. TDRs in the consumer real estate portfolio that were
    removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of new
    accounting guidance were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, of which $426 million
    and $395 million were nonperforming. These nonperforming
    loans are excluded from the table below.

Nonperforming consumer real estate TDRs, included in the table
    below, as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and
    foreclosed properties, declined to 16 percent at
    December 31, 2010 from 21 percent at December 31,
    2009. This was due to nonperforming TDRs returning to performing
    status and charge-offs, including those charged off to comply
    with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on
    collateral dependent modified loans, both of which outpaced new
    additions of nonperforming TDRs.

    on page 81.

Consumer loans may be returned to
    performing status when all principal and interest is current and
    full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and
    interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes
    well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain TDRs
    are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and
    may only be returned to performing status after considering the
    borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable
    period, generally six months.

(4)   

Our policy is not to classify
    consumer credit card and consumer loans not secured by real
    estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these
    loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly
    are excluded from this table.

(5)   

At December 31, 2010,
    67 percent of nonperforming loans are 180 days or more
    past due and have been written down through charge-offs to
    69 percent of the unpaid principal balance.

(6)   

Our policy is to record any losses
    in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the
    allowance for loan and lease losses during the first
    90 days after transfer of a loan into foreclosed
    properties. Thereafter, all gains and losses in value are
    recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in
    the table above are net of $575 million and
    $818 million of charge-offs during 2010 and 2009, taken
    during the first 90 days after transfer.

Commercial
    Portfolio Credit Risk Management  

Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with
    an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or
    counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As
    part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial
    credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to
    approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent
    to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing
    basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the
    financial condition, cash flow, risk profile, or outlook of a
    borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we
    consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single
    name concentration limits while also balancing the total
    borrower or counterparty relationship. Our lines of business and
    risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously
    monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform
    under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to
    measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In
    addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of
    assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses.

For information on our accounting policies regarding
    delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the
    commercial portfolio, refer to  Note 1  
    Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management of
    Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations  

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal
    that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in
    undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage
    concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,
    geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review,
    measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic
    location and property type. In addition, within our
    international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by
    country. Tables 38, 42, 48 and 49 summarize our concentrations.
    We also utilize syndication of exposure to third parties, loan
    sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage
    the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.

As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt
    to work with clients to modify their loans to terms that better
    align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an
    economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing
    financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs.

We account for certain large corporate loans and loan
    commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit
    which are considered utilized for credit risk management
    purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration
    guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments,

both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored,
    and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships
    may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the
    Corporation s credit view and market perspectives
    determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In
    addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded
    portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit
    exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit
    protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an
    industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.
    These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for
    treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value
    with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss).

Commercial Credit
    Portfolio  

U.S.-based 
    loan balances continued to decline on weak loan demand as
    businesses aggressively managed their working capital and
    production capacity by maintaining lean inventories, staff
    levels, physical locations and capital expenditures.
    Additionally, many borrowers continued to access the capital
    markets for financing while reducing their use of bank credit
    facilities. Risk mitigation strategies and net charge-offs
    further contributed to the decline in loan balances.
    Fourth-quarter balances showed stabilization relative to prior
    quarters.
     Non-U.S. commercial 
    loans showed strong growth from client demand, driven by
    regional economic conditions and the positive impact of our
    initiatives in Asia and other emerging markets.

Reservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and
    nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in
    the commercial credit portfolio declined in 2010. These
    reductions were driven primarily by the U.S. commercial and
    commercial real estate portfolios. U.S. commercial was
    driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients,
    industries and lines of business. Commercial real estate also
    continued to show signs of stabilization during 2010; however,
    levels of stressed commercial real estate loans remained
    elevated. Most other credit indicators across the remaining
    commercial portfolio have also improved.

Table 34 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related
    credit quality information at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch that were considered
    purchased credit-impaired were written down to fair value upon
    acquisition and amounted to $204 million and

    loans are excluded from the nonperforming loans and accruing
    balances 90 days or more past due even though the customer

Table 36 presents commercial credit exposure by type for

    Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial
    guarantees, bankers  acceptances and commercial letters of
    credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance
    funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period.
    Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types
    are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.
    Total commercial committed credit exposure decreased
    $68.1 billion, or eight percent, at December 31, 2010
    compared to December 31, 2009 driven primarily by
    reductions in both funded and unfunded loan and lease exposure.

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased
    $45.1 billion, or nine percent, at December 31, 2010
    compared to December 31, 2009. Utilized

loans and leases declined as businesses continued to
    aggressively manage working capital and production capacity,
    maintain low inventories and defer capital expenditures as the
    economic outlook remained uncertain. Clients also continued to
    access the capital markets for their funding needs to reduce
    reliance on bank credit facilities. The decline in utilized
    loans and leases was also due to the sale of First Republic
    effective July 1, 2010 and the transfer of certain
    exposures into LHFS partially offset by the increase in conduit
    balances related to the adoption of new consolidation guidance.
    The utilization rate for loans and leases, letters of credit and
    financial guarantees, and bankers  acceptances was
    57 percent at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Table 37 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized
    exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the
    Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as
    defined by regulatory authorities. In addition to reservable
    loans and leases, excluding those accounted for under the fair
    value option, exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees,
    bankers  acceptances and commercial letters of credit for
    which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed
    conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have
    not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized
    for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial

utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased
    $16.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to
    December 31, 2009, due to decreases across all portfolios,
    primarily U.S. commercial and commercial real estate driven
    largely by continued paydowns, payoffs and, to a diminishing
    extent, charge-offs. Despite the improvements, utilized
    reservable criticized levels remain elevated in commercial real
    estate. At December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent
    of the loans within commercial utilized reservable criticized
    exposure were secured.

U.S.
    Commercial  

At December 31, 2010, 57 percent and 25 percent
    of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small
    business, were included in  Global Commercial Banking  and
     GBAM . The remaining 18 percent was mostly included
    in  GWIM  (business-purpose loans for wealthy clients).
    Outstanding U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans
    accounted for under the fair value option, decreased
    $5.8 billion primarily due to reduced customer demand and
    continued client utilization of the capital markets, partially
    offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance which
    increased loans by $5.3 billion on January 1, 2010.
    Compared to December 31, 2009, reservable criticized
    balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined
    $11.1 billion and $1.5 billion. The declines were
    broad-based in terms of borrowers and industries and were driven
    by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net
    charge-offs decreased $1.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009.

Commercial Real
    Estate  

The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in
     Global Commercial Banking  and consists of loans made
    primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and
    commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased
    $20.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared

to December 31, 2009 due to portfolio attrition, the sale
    of First Republic, transfer of certain assets to LHFS and net
    charge-offs. The portfolio remains diversified across property
    types and geographic regions. California represents the largest
    state concentration at 18 percent of commercial real estate
    loans and leases at December 31, 2010. For more information
    on geographic and property concentrations, refer to Table 38.

Credit quality for commercial real estate is showing signs of
    stabilization; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and
    ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to
    affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Compared to
    December 31, 2009, nonperforming commercial real estate
    loans and foreclosed properties decreased in the homebuilder,
    retail and land development property types, partially offset by
    an increase in office and multi-use property types. Reservable
    criticized balances declined by $3.3 billion primarily due
    to stabilization in the homebuilder portfolio and retail and
    unsecured segments in the non-homebuilder portfolio, partially
    offset by continued deterioration in the multi-family rental and
    office property types within the non-homebuilder portfolio. Net
    charge-offs decreased $685 million in 2010 compared to 2009
    due to declines in the homebuilder portfolio resulting from a
    slower rate of declining appraisal values.

During 2010, we continued to see stabilization in the

    portfolio remain most at-risk as occupancy rates, rental rates
    and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We have
    adopted a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to
    reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real
    estate portfolios.

At December 31, 2010, we had total committed
    non-homebuilder exposure of $64.2 billion compared to
    $84.4 billion at December 31, 2009, with the decrease
    due to the sale of First Republic, repayments and net
    charge-offs. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed
    properties were $4.6 billion, or 10.08 percent of
    total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties at
    December 31, 2010 compared to $4.8 billion, or
    7.73 percent, at December 31, 2009. Non-homebuilder
    utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to
    $17.1 billion, or 35.55 percent, at December 31,
    2010 compared to $18.1 billion, or 27.27 percent, at
    December 31, 2009. The decrease in criticized exposure was
    primarily in the retail and unsecured segments, with the ratio
    increasing due to declining loan balances. For the
    non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs increased
    $187 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The changes were
    concentrated in land development and retail.

At December 31, 2010, we had committed homebuilder exposure
    of $6.0 billion compared to $10.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009 of which $4.3 billion and
    $7.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in
    homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net
    charge-offs,

reductions in new home construction and continued risk
    mitigation initiatives. At December 31, 2010, homebuilder
    nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties declined
    $1.3 billion due to repayments, net charge-offs, fewer risk
    rating downgrades and a slowdown in the rate of home price
    declines compared to December 31, 2009. Homebuilder
    utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased by
    $2.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to repayments and net
    charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed
    properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the
    homebuilder portfolio were 42.80 percent and
    74.27 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to
    42.16 percent and 74.44 percent at December 31,
    2009. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio decreased
    $872 million in 2010 compared to 2009.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the commercial real estate
    loan portfolio included $19.1 billion and
    $27.4 billion of funded construction and land development
    loans that were originated to fund the construction
     and/or 
    rehabilitation of commercial properties. This portfolio is
    mostly secured and diversified across property types and
    geographies but faces significant challenges in the current
    housing and rental markets. Weak rental

demand and cash flows, along with declining property valuations
    have resulted in elevated levels of reservable criticized
    exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties, and net
    charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land
    development loans totaled $10.5 billion and
    $13.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    Nonperforming construction and land development loans and
    foreclosed properties totaled $4.0 billion and
    $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. During a
    property s construction phase, interest income is typically
    paid from interest reserves that are established at the
    inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the
    property is put into service, these interest reserves are
    depleted and interest begins to be paid from operating cash
    flows. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans
    until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income
    on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an
    interest reserve.

Non-U.S. 
    Commercial  

The
     non-U.S. commercial 
    loan portfolio is managed primarily in  GBAM . Outstanding
    loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value
    option, showed growth from client demand driven by regional
    economic conditions and the positive impact of our initiatives
    in Asia and other emerging markets. Net charge-offs decreased
    $426 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to stabilization
    in the portfolio. For additional information on the
     non-U.S. commercial 
    portfolio, refer to
     Non-U.S. Portfolio 
    beginning on page 94.

U.S. Small
    Business Commercial  

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is
    comprised of business card and small business loans managed in
     Global Card Services  and  Global Commercial
    Banking . U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs
    decreased $968 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Although
    losses remain

elevated, the reduction in net charge-offs was driven by lower
    levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies resulting from
    U.S. economic improvement as well as the reduction of
    higher risk vintages and the impact of higher quality
    originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net
    charge-offs for 2010, 79 percent were credit card-related
    products compared to 81 percent during 2009.

Commercial Loans
    Carried at Fair Value  

The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair
    value option is managed primarily in  GBAM . Outstanding
    commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option
    decreased $1.6 billion to an aggregate fair value of
    $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to
    December 31, 2009 due primarily to reduced corporate
    borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses
    of $89 million resulting from new originations, loans being
    paid off at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan
    portfolio during 2010 compared to net gains of $515 million
    during 2009. These amounts were primarily attributable to
    changes in instrument-specific credit risk and were largely
    offset by gains or losses from hedging activities.

In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit
    had an aggregate fair value of $866 million and
    $950 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and were
    recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The
    associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending
    commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair
    value option were $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Net gains resulting from new
    originations, terminations and changes in the fair value of
    commitments and letters of credit of $172 million were
    recorded during 2010 compared to net gains of $1.4 billion
    for 2009. These gains were primarily attributable to changes in
    instrument-specific credit risk.

Nonperforming
    Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties
    Activity  

The table below presents the nonperforming commercial loans,
    leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2010 and 2009.
    The $2.9 billion decrease at December 31, 2010
    compared to December 31, 2009 was driven by paydowns,
    payoffs and charge-offs in the commercial real estate and
    U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 95 percent
    of commercial

nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are
    secured and approximately 40 percent are contractually
    current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried
    at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal
    balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease
    losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to
    the estimated net realizable value.

    are included in Table 41. Nonperforming TDRs increased
    $466 million while performing TDRs increased
    $147 million during 2010.

U.S. commercial TDRs were $356 million, an increase of
    $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Nonperforming U.S. commercial TDRs decreased
    $52 million during 2010, while performing TDRs excluded
    from nonperforming loans in Table 41 increased $112 million.

At December 31, 2010, the commercial real estate TDR
    balance was $815 million, an increase of $547 million
    during 2010. Nonperforming TDRs increased $524 million
    during the year, while performing TDRs increased
    $23 million.

At December 31, 2010 the
     non-U.S. commercial 
    TDR balance was $19 million, an increase of
    $6 million. Nonperforming TDRs decreased $6 million
    during the year, while performing TDRs increased

Industry
    Concentrations  

Table 42 presents commercial committed and utilized credit
    exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection
    purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain
    credit exposures. Our commercial

credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of
    industries. The decline in commercial committed exposure of
    $68.1 billion from December 31, 2009 to
    December 31, 2010 was broad-based across most industries.

Industry limits are used internally to manage industry
    concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital
    usage that are allocated on an
     industry-by-industry 
    basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and
    approve industry limits, as well as to provide ongoing
    monitoring. Management s Credit Risk Committee (CRC)
    oversees industry limit governance.

Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration,
    experienced a decrease in committed exposure of
    $25.8 billion, or 24 percent, at December 31,
    2010 compared to December 31, 2009. This decrease was
    driven primarily by a reduction in exposure to conduits tied to
    the consumer finance industry.

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration,
    experienced a decrease in committed exposure of
    $21.1 billion, or 23 percent, at December 31,
    2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due primarily to
    portfolio attrition. Real estate construction and land
    development exposure represented 27 percent of the total

The $11.8 billion, or 34 percent, decline in
    individuals and trusts committed exposure was largely due to the
    unwinding of two derivative transactions. Committed exposure in
    the banking industry increased $6.3 billion, or 27 percent,
    at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009
    primarily due to increases in both traded products and loan
    exposure as a result of momentum from growth initiatives. The
    decline of $4.5 billion, or 10 percent, in consumer
    services was concentrated in gaming and restaurants. Committed
    exposure for the commercial services and supplies industry
    declined $4.1 billion, or 12 percent, primarily due to
    reduced loan demand and the sale of First Republic.

The recent economic downturn has had a residual effect on debt
    issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures
    to these municipalities. While historically default rates were
    low, stress on the municipalities  financials due to the
    economic downturn has increased the potential for defaults in
    the near term. As part of our overall and ongoing risk
    management processes, we continually monitor these exposures
    through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal
    communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties
     and/or 
    sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are
    compliant with established concentration guidelines.

Monoline and
    Related Exposure  

Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and
    managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. Direct loan
    exposure to monolines consisted of revolvers in the amount of
    $51 million and $41 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009.

We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of
    guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios,
    securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our
    public finance business and other selected products. Such
    indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection

from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on
    certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite
    our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying
    securities.

We also have indirect exposure to monolines, primarily in the
    form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales.
    Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased
    from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on
    certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when
    we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the
    loan has declined or we are required to indemnify or provide
    recourse for a guarantor s loss. For additional information
    regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see
     Note 9   Representations and Warranties
    Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties
    beginning on page 52. For additional information regarding
    monolines, see  Note 14   Commitments and
    Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Monoline derivative credit exposure at December 31, 2010
    had a notional value of $38.4 billion compared to
    $42.6 billion at December 31, 2009.
     Mark-to-market 
    monoline derivative credit exposure was $9.2 billion at
    December 31, 2010 compared to $11.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009 with the decrease driven by positive
    valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline
    contracts. At December 31, 2010, the counterparty credit
    valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was
    $5.3 billion compared to $6.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009. This reduced our net
     mark-to-market 
    exposure to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 compared
    to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. At
    December 31, 2010, approximately 62 percent of this
    exposure was related to one monoline compared to approximately
    54 percent at December 31, 2009. We do not hold
    collateral against these derivative exposures. For more
    information on our monoline exposure, see  GBAM  beginning
    on page 45.

We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in
    securities where the issuers have purchased wraps (i.e.,
    insurance). For example, municipalities and corporations
    purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing.
    If the ratings agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit
    rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on
    the market value of the security. In the case of default, we
    first look to the underlying

securities and then to recovery on the purchased insurance.
    Investments in securities issued by municipalities and
    corporations with purchased wraps at December 31, 2010 and
    2009 had a notional value of $2.4 billion and
    $5.0 billion.
     Mark-to-market 
    investment exposure was $2.2 billion at December 31,
    2010 compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009.

Risk
    Mitigation  

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as
    well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To
    lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection
    levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry,
    borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, net notional credit default
    protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to
    hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the
    fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,
    was $20.1 billion and $19.0 billion. The
     mark-to-market 
    effects, including the cost of net credit default protection
    hedging our

credit exposure, resulted in net losses of $546 million
    during 2010 compared to net losses of $2.9 billion in 2009.
    The average
     Value-at-Risk 
    (VaR) for these credit derivative hedges was $53 million
    for 2010 compared to $76 million for 2009. The average VaR
    for the related credit exposure was $65 million in 2010
    compared to $130 million in 2009. There is a
    diversification effect between the net credit default protection
    hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such
    that the combined average VaR was $41 million for 2010,
    compared to $89 million for 2009. Refer to Trading Risk
    Management beginning on page 100 for a description of our

    principally investment grade, credit default swaps indices
    include names in and across each of the ratings categories.

In addition to our net notional credit default protection
    purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain
    credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making
    activities for clients and establishing positions intended to
    profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute
    the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market
    with large, multinational financial institutions, including
    broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other
    investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC
    market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also

subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties
    fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most
    cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily
    margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade,
    depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit
    covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of
    collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable,
     and/or  allow
    us to take additional protective measures such as early
    termination of all trades.

The notional amounts presented in Table 45 represent the total
    contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and
    include both purchased and written credit derivatives. The
    credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost, in
    the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position
    to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For
    information on the performance risk of our written credit
    derivatives, see  Note 4   Derivatives  to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The credit risk amounts discussed on page 92 and noted in the
    table below take into consideration the effects of legally
    enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in
     Note 4   Derivatives  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk
    reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to
    non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that
    may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby
    reducing the Corporation s overall exposure.

Counterparty
    Credit Risk Valuation Adjustments  

We record a counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment on
    certain derivative assets, including our credit default
    protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit
    quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are necessary as
    the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit
    risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider
    collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements
    that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in
    determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment.
    All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation
    adjustments are reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods
    due to changes in the value of the derivative contract,
    collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.

During 2010 and 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) of
    $731 million and $3.1 billion ($(8) million and
    $1.7 billion, net of hedges) were recognized in trading
    account profits (losses) for counterparty credit risk related to
    derivative assets. For additional information on gains or losses
    related to the counterparty credit risk on derivative assets,
    refer to  Note 4   Derivatives  to the

Non-U.S. 
    Portfolio  

Our
     non-U.S. credit 
    and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define
    country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and
    political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability
    and changes in government policies. A risk management framework
    is in place to measure, monitor and manage
     non-U.S. risk 
    and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including
    cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a
    subcommittee of the CRC.

The following table sets forth total
     non-U.S. exposure 
    broken out by region at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
     Non-U.S. exposure 
    includes credit

exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other
    investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the
    U.S. Total
     non-U.S. exposure 
    can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and
    certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to
    external guarantees are reported under the country of the
    guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in
    the country where the collateral is held. For securities
    received, other than cross-border resale agreements,
    outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the
    securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on
    the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting
    requirements.

    collateral applied of $44.2 billion and $34.3 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(3)   

Generally, resale agreements are
    presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent
    with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale
    agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury
    securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded
    from this presentation.

Our total
     non-U.S. exposure 
    was $262.1 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase
    of $4.4 billion from December 31, 2009. Our
     non-U.S. exposure 
    remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for
    $148.1 billion, or 57 percent, of total
     non-U.S. exposure. 
    The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was
    distributed across a variety of industries. The decrease of
    $22.7 billion in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts
    to reduce exposure in the peripheral Eurozone countries and sale
    or maturity of securities in the U.K. Select European countries
    are further detailed in Table 49. Asia Pacific was our second
    largest
     non-U.S. exposure 
    at $73.3 billion, or 28 percent. The
    $25.6 billion increase in Asia Pacific was predominantly
    driven by a required change in accounting for our CCB
    investment, increased securities exposure in Japan, and
    increased securities and loan exposure in other Asia Pacific
    emerging markets. For more information on the required change in
    accounting for our CCB investment, refer to
     Note 5   Securities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Latin America accounted for
    $14.8 billion, or six percent, of total
     non-U.S. exposure. 
    The $4.7 billion decrease in Latin America was primarily
    driven by the sale of our equity investments in Ita 
    Unibanco and Santander. Other
     non-U.S. exposure 
    was $22.2 billion at

December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.4 billion from
    the prior year resulting from an increase in Canadian
    cross-border loans. For more information on our Asia Pacific and
    Latin America exposure, see
     non-U.S. exposure 
    to selected countries defined as emerging markets on
    page 95.

As shown in Table 47, the United Kingdom, France and China had
    total cross-border exposure greater than one percent of our
    total assets and were the only countries where total
    cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets
    at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, Canada and
    Japan had total cross-border exposure of $17.9 billion and
    $17.0 billion representing 0.79 percent and
    0.75 percent of total assets. Canada and Japan were the
    only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that
    exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at
    December 31, 2010.

Exposure includes cross-border claims by our
     non-U.S. offices 
    including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading
    account assets, securities, derivative assets, other
    interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts
    also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of
    credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent
    with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country
    Exposure Report.

As presented in Table 48,
     non-U.S. exposure 
    to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased
    $14.5 billion to $65.1 billion at December 31,
    2010 compared to $50.6 billion at December 31, 2009.
    The increase was due to an increase in the Asia Pacific region
    which was partially offset by a

decrease in Latin America.
     Non-U.S. exposure 
    to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented
    25 percent and 20 percent of total

    Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities
    are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the

Cross-border exposure includes
    amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or
    counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in
    which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which
    the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting
    requirements.

(6)   

Local country exposure includes
    amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country
    of residence in which the credit is booked regardless of the
    currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or
    liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with
    FFIEC reporting requirements. Total amount of available local
    liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31,
    2010 was $15.7 billion compared to $17.6 billion at
    December 31, 2009. Local liabilities at December 31,
    2010 in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa
    were $15.1 billion, $451 million and
    $193 million, respectively, of which $7.9 billion was
    in Singapore, $1.8 billion in both China and Hong Kong,
    $1.2 billion in India, $802 million in South Korea and
    $573 million in Taiwan. There were no other countries with
    available local liabilities funding local country exposure
    greater than $500 million.

(7)   

No country included in Other Asia
    Pacific, Other Latin America, Other Middle East and Africa, and
    Other Central and Eastern Europe had total
     non-U.S. 
    exposure of more than $500 million.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 70 percent and
    53 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia
    Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific increased by
    $18.3 billion primarily driven by our equity investment in
    CCB, which accounted for $10.6 billion, or 58 percent,
    of the increase in Asia, and increases in loans in India and
    securities in Singapore. The increase in our equity investment
    in CCB was driven by a required change in accounting. For more
    information on our CCB investment, refer to
     Note 5   Securities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 21 percent and
    35 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin
    America. Latin America emerging markets exposure decreased
    $3.8 billion driven by the sale of our equity investments
    in Ita  Unibanco and Santander, which accounted for
    $5.4 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31,
    2009, partially offset by increased loans across the region. For
    more information on these sales, refer to
     Note 5   Securities  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, six percent and seven
    percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and
    Africa, with a decrease of

$81 million primarily driven by a decrease in securities in
    South Africa, offset by increases in loans in the United Arab
    Emirates and South Africa, and securities in Bahrain. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, three percent and five percent
    of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern
    Europe.

Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,
    Portugal and Spain, are currently experiencing varying degrees
    of financial stress. These countries have had certain credit
    ratings lowered by ratings services during 2010. Risks from the
    debt crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the

financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on the
    global economic recovery and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in
    these countries. The table below shows our direct sovereign and
    non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card
    exposure, in these countries at December 31, 2010. The
    total exposure to these countries was $15.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010 compared to $25.5 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The $9.7 billion decrease since
    December 31, 2009 was driven primarily by the sale or
    maturity of sovereign and non-sovereign securities in all
    countries.

Provision
    for Credit Losses  

The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to
    $28.4 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for
    credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased
    $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for 2010 compared to
    2009 reflecting lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies
    in the consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending
    portfolios resulting from an improving economic outlook. Also
    contributing to the improvement were lower reserve additions in
    consumer real estate due to improving portfolio trends. The
    addition to reserves in the consumer PCI loan portfolios
    reflected further reductions in expected principal cash flows of
    $2.2 billion for 2010 compared to $3.5 billion a year
    earlier. Consumer net charge-offs of $29.4 billion for 2010
    were $4.2 billion higher than the prior year due to the
    impact of the adoption of new

consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain
    securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home
    equity portfolios, offset by benefits from economic improvement
    during the year which impacted all consumer portfolios.

The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio,
    including the provision for unfunded lending commitments,
    decreased $8.7 billion to $3.0 billion for 2010
    compared to 2009 due to improved borrower credit profiles,
    stabilization of appraisal values in the commercial real estate
    portfolio and lower delinquencies and bankruptcies in the small
    business portfolio. These same factors resulted in a decrease in
    commercial net charge-offs of $3.5 billion to
    $5.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009.

Allowance
    for Credit Losses  

Allowance for
    Loan and Lease Losses  

The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on
    two components, described below, based on whether a loan or
    lease is performing or whether it has been individually
    identified as being impaired or has been modified as a TDR. We
    evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses
    based on the total of these two components. The allowance for
    loan and lease losses excludes loans
     held-for-sale 
    and loans accounted for under the fair value option, as fair
    value adjustments related to loans measured at fair value
    include a credit risk component.

The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses
    covers nonperforming commercial loans, consumer real estate
    loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit
    card, unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans
    are subject to impairment measurement primarily at the loan
    level based either on the present value of expected future cash
    flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest
    rate, or discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual
    percentage rate, excluding renegotiated and promotionally priced
    loans for the renegotiated TDR portfolio. Impairment measurement
    may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan s
    observable market price. When the determined or measured values
    are lower than the carrying value of the loan, impairment is
    recognized. For purposes of computing this specific loss
    component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated
    individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool
    using historical loss experience for the respective product
    types and risk ratings of the loans.

The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses
    covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases which
    have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable.
    The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial
    loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio
    evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are
    utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not
    limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or
    foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic
    trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast
    model estimates the portion of our homogeneous loans that will
    default based on individual loan attributes, the most
    significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, borrower credit
    score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further
    broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating
    refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us
    to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our
    allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models
    are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information
    reflecting the current economic environment. Included within
    this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses
    and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are
    reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect
    our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global
    economic uncertainty and large single name defaults. We evaluate
    the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on
    the combined total of these two components. As of
    December 31, 2010, inputs to the loss forecast process
    resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer
    portfolios.

The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is
    established by product type after analyzing historical loss
    experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions,
    industry performance trends, geographic or obligor
    concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other
    pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial
    loans are generally updated annually and utilize the
    Corporation s historical database of actual defaults and
    other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the
    commercial portfolios are updated at least quarterly to
    incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic
    environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the
    probability of default (PD) and the loss given

default (LGD) based on the Corporation s historical
    experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered
    when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the
    underlying collateral, if applicable; the industry in which the
    obligor operates; the obligor s liquidity and other
    financial indicators; and other quantitative and qualitative
    factors relevant to the obligor s credit risk. When
    estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management
    relies not only on models derived from historical experience but
    also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable
    losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current
    macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in
    models, and other qualitative factors. As of December 31,
    2010, updates to the loan risk ratings and composition resulted
    in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios.

We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred
    loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic
    assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios
    and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those
    portfolios.

Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease
    losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the
    provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be
    uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and
    lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are
    credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.

The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer
    portfolio as presented in Table 51 was $34.7 billion at
    December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.9 billion from
    December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily related to
    $10.8 billion of reserves recorded on January 1, 2010
    in connection with the adoption of new consolidation guidance,
    and higher reserve additions in the non-impaired consumer real
    estate portfolios during the first half of 2010 amid continued
    stress in the housing market. These items were partially offset
    by reserve reductions primarily due to improving credit quality
    in the  Global Card Services  consumer portfolios. With
    respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our
    expected principal cash flows resulted in an increase in
    reserves through provision of $2.2 billion for 2010,
    primarily in the home equity and discontinued real estate
    portfolios compared to $3.5 billion in 2009.

The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was
    $7.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a $2.2 billion
    decrease from December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily
    due to improvements in the U.S. small business commercial
    portfolio within  Global Card Services  due to improved
    delinquencies and bankruptcies, as well as in the
    U.S. commercial portfolios primarily in  Global
    Commercial Banking  and  GBAM,  and the commercial real
    estate portfolio primarily within  Global Commercial Banking
     reflecting improved borrower credit profiles as a result of
    improving economic conditions.

The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total
    loans and leases outstanding was 4.47 percent at
    December 31, 2010 compared to 4.16 percent at
    December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratio was mostly due
    to consumer reserve increases for securitized loans consolidated
    under the new consolidation guidance, which were primarily
    credit card loans. The December 31, 2010 and 2009 ratios
    above include the impact of the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding
    the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses
    as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was
    3.94 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to
    3.88 percent at December 31, 2009.

Reserve for
    Unfunded Lending Commitments  

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also
    estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments
    such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding loan
    commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair
    value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the
    same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of PD and
    LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the

Bank of America
    2010        97  

Table of Contents   

estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To
    estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely
    to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default,
    analyses of the Corporation s historical experience are
    applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded
    exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded
    lending commitments is the product of the PD, the LGD and the
    EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic
    uncertainty and inherent uncertainty in models.

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at
    December 31, 2010 was $1.2 billion, $299 million
    lower than December 31, 2009 primarily driven by accretion
    of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch
    unfunded positions and customer utilizations of previously
    unfunded positions.

    losses for 2010 and 2009.

Market
    Risk Management  

Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or
    revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
    conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in
    the financial instruments associated with our operations
     and/or 
    activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term
    borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and
    liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and
    liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated
    with our traditional banking business, customer and other
    trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation
    activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of
    market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements
    and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation.

Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading
    positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for
    assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).
    However, these positions are still subject to changes in
    economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily
    changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse
    changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is
    managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account
    for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.
    For further information on the fair value of certain financial
    assets and liabilities, see  Note 22   Fair
    Value Measurements  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes
    currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to
    various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates
    and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity,
    commodity, issuer and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to
    mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass
    a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and
    derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk
    components along with respective risk mitigation techniques.

Interest Rate
    Risk  

Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose
    values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates.
    These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt
    securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities,
    deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. Hedging
    instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives
    such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.

Foreign Exchange
    Risk  

Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the
    values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in
    other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk
    include investments in
     non-U.S. subsidiaries, 
    foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash
    flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange
    transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various
    foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate
    with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange
    rates or
     non-U.S. interest 
    rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include
    foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards,
    foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.

Mortgage
    Risk  

Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of
    mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments
    are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt
    ratings, default, market liquidity, other interest rates,
    government participation and interest rate volatility. Our
    exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we
    trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of
    mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through
    certificates, commercial mortgages, and collateralized mortgage
    obligations (CMOs) including CDOs using mortgages as

underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS
    which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in
    anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold
    positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans
    as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of
    our mortgage origination activities. See
     Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting
    Principles  and  Note 25   Mortgage
    Servicing Rights  to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to
    mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency
    swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt.

Equity Market
    Risk  

Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that
    represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of
    domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked
    instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure
    include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock,
    exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible
    bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls),
     over-the-counter 
    equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures
    and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used
    to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps,
    convertible bonds and cash positions.

Commodity
    Risk  

Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the
    petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and
    options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include
    options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity
    product, as well as cash positions.

Issuer Credit
    Risk  

Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the
    creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our
    portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an
    asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of
    credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging
    instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, credit
    default swaps and other credit fixed-income instruments.

Market Liquidity
    Risk  

Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of
    expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain
    cases, may even cease to exist. This exposes us to the risk that
    we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in
    an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact
    could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing
    correlations are compromised by the disproportionate demand or
    lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk
    mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail below.

Trading
    Risk Management  

Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from
    trading positions, including market-based net interest income,
    in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading
    account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are
    reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see
     Note 22   Fair Value Measurements  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can
    be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions
    and customer demand. Trading-related revenues are dependent on
    the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed,
    and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time
    within the ever-changing market environment.

The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global
    Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the
    primary governance

100        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

authority for Global Markets Risk Management including trading
    risk management. The GRC s focus is to take a
    forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks
    impacting  GBAM  and prioritize those that need a proactive
    risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact lines of
    business outside of  GBAM  are monitored and governed by
    their respective governance authorities.

The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by
    business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses.
    Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to
    determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant
    for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an
    explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The
    thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective
    risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed
    what is considered to be normal daily income statement
    volatility.

The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility
    and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for
    the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as compared with
    the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. During the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2010, positive
    trading-related revenue was recorded for 90 percent of the
    trading days of which 75 percent were daily trading gains
    of over $25 million, four percent of the trading days had
    losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was
    $102 million. This can be compared to the twelve months
    ended December 31, 2009, where positive trading-related
    revenue was recorded for 88 percent of the trading days of
    which 72 percent were daily trading gains of over
    $25 million, six percent of the trading days had losses
    greater than $25 million and the largest loss was
    $100 million.

Histogram
    of Daily Trading-related Revenue  

To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the
    actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well
    as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market
    risk. In order to manage
     day-to-day 
    risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall
    trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit
    excesses are communicated to management for review.

A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of
    hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of
    potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the
    portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends
    with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility
    of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their
    risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are
    significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from
    company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model
    depends on the availability and quality of historical data for
    each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require
    additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not
    have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions
    for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.

A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of
    potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are
    however many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes
    historical results over a defined time period to estimate future
    performance. Historical results may not always be indicative

of future results and changes in market conditions or in the
    composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material
    impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR
    model to reflect current market conditions, we update the
    historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis
    and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model.

We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so
    that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio.
    Nevertheless, due to the limitations mentioned above, we have
    historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in
    managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as
    stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market
    stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying
    degrees.

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting
    (i.e., comparing actual results against expectations derived
    from historical data) the VaR results against the daily profit
    and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with
    additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to
    the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed
    VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of
    these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members
    communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a
    result of this process, the lines of business may selectively
    reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or
    macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure.

The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for
    the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Actual losses
    did not exceed daily trading VaR in the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our VaR model uses a historical
    simulation approach based on three years of historical data

and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a
    99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that
    losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days,
    or two to three times each year.

The high and low for the total
    portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as
    the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred
    on different trading days.

The decrease in average VaR during 2010 resulted from reduced
    exposures in several businesses. In addition, portfolio
    diversification increased relative to average VaR, as exposure
    changes resulted in reduced correlations across businesses.

Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the
     mark-to-market 
    value of our derivative exposures reflecting the impact of the
    credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since
    counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR
    component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not
    include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included
    in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our
    histogram or used for backtesting.

Trading Portfolio
    Stress Testing  

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can
    exceed our estimates, we also  stress test  our
    portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our
    trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market
    movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical
    or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall
    trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical
    scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred
    during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a
    10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe

point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario.
    Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks
    from predefined market stress events. These stress events
    include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be
    well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to
    calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the
    hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term
    market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as
    necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or
    political information. In addition to the value afforded by the
    results themselves, this information provides senior management
    with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the
    relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing
    for the trading portfolio is also integrated with
    enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits
    framework. A process has been established to promote consistency
    between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those
    used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for
    enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical
    trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time
    horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for
    use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For
    additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see
    page 68.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities  

Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk
    exposure to our nontrading exposures. Our overall goal is to
    manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do
    not adversely affect core net interest income. Interest rate
    risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net
    interest income caused by changes in market interest rates.
    Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking,
    create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
    Interest rate risk from these activities, as well as the impact
    of changing market conditions, is managed through our ALM
    activities.

Simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest
    income of numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends
    and strategies. These simulations evaluate how changes in
    short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans,
    deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments impact core net
    interest income. In addition, these simulations incorporate
    assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and
    deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset
    and liability repricing and

maturity characteristics. These simulations do not include the
    impact of hedge ineffectiveness.

Management analyzes core net interest income forecasts utilizing
    different rate scenarios with the baseline utilizing
    market-based forward interest rates. Management frequently
    updates the core net interest income forecast for changing
    assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and
    market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance
    sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of
    exposure to interest rate changes.

We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest
    income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected
    future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of
    interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward
    curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative
    interest rate scenarios have on the static baseline forecast in
    order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied
    conditions. The spot and
     12-month 
    forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecast
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the table
    below.

Table
    53   Forward
    Rates  

Table 54 shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net
    interest income over the next twelve months from
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, resulting from a 100 bps
    gradual parallel increase, a 100 bps gradual parallel
    decrease, a 100 bps gradual curve flattening (increase in
    short-term rates or

decrease in long-term rates) and a 100 bps gradual curve
    steepening (decrease in short-term rates or increase in
    long-term rates) from the forward market curve. For further
    discussion of core net interest income, see page 37.

Prior periods are reported on a
    managed basis.

The sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in
    response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. At
    December 31, 2010, the exposure as reported reflects
    impacts that may be realized in net interest income. At
    December 31, 2009, the estimated exposure as reported
    reflects impacts that would have been realized primarily in net
    interest income and card income.

Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel
    move in interest rates at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    The change in the interest rate risk position relative to
    December 31, 2009 is primarily due to lower short-term
    interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use
    securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign
    exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.

Securities  

The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position
    and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and
    to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and
    other debt securities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, AFS
    debt securities were $337.6 billion and
    $301.6 billion. During 2010 and 2009, we purchased AFS debt
    securities of $199.2 billion and $185.1 billion, sold
    $97.5 billion and $159.4 billion, and had maturities
    and received paydowns of $70.9 billion and
    $59.9 billion. We realized $2.5 billion and
    $4.7 billion in net gains on sales of debt securities
    during 2010 and 2009. In addition, we securitized
    $2.4 billion and $14.0 billion of residential mortgage
    loans into MBS during 2010 and 2009, which we retained.

Bank of America
    2010        103  

Table of Contents   

During 2010, we entered into a series of transactions in our AFS
    debt securities portfolio that involved securitizations as well
    as sales of non-agency RMBS. These transactions were initiated
    following a review of corporate risk objectives in light of
    proposed Basel regulatory capital changes and liquidity targets.
    For more information on the proposed regulatory capital changes,
    see Capital Management   Regulatory Capital Changes
    beginning on page 64. During 2010, the carrying value of
    the non-agency RMBS portfolio was reduced $14.5 billion
    primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales and
    securitizations as well as paydowns. We recognized net losses of
    $922 million on the series of transactions in the AFS debt
    securities portfolio, and improved the overall credit quality of
    the remaining portfolio such that the percentage of the
    non-agency RMBS portfolio that is below investment-grade was
    reduced significantly.

Accumulated OCI includes after-tax net unrealized gains of
    $7.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized
    gains of $714 million and after-tax net unrealized losses
    of $628 million related to AFS debt securities and
    after-tax net unrealized gains of $6.7 billion and
    $2.1 billion related to AFS equity securities. The 2010
    unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to
    our investment in CCB. See  Note 5   Securities
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    discussion on marketable equity securities. Total market value
    of the AFS debt securities was $337.6 billion and
    $301.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009 with a
    weighted-average duration of 4.9 and 4.5 years, and
    primarily relates to our MBS and U.S. Treasury portfolio.
    The amount of pre-tax accumulated OCI related to AFS debt
    securities increased by $2.2 billion during 2010 to
    $1.1 billion, primarily due to sales of non-agency CMO
    positions.

We recognized $967 million of OTTI losses through earnings
    on AFS debt securities in 2010 compared to $2.8 billion in
    2009. We also recognized $3 million of OTTI losses on AFS
    marketable equity securities during 2010 compared to
    $326 million in 2009.

The recognition of impairment losses on AFS debt and marketable
    equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including
    the length of time and extent to which the market value has been
    less than cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the
    security including credit ratings and the specific events
    affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that
    collateralize the debt security, other industry and
    macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the
    security to recovery. We do not intend to sell securities with
    unrealized losses and it is not more-likely-than-not that we
    will be required to sell those securities before recovery of
    amortized cost. Based on our evaluation of these and other
    relevant factors, and after consideration of the losses
    described in the paragraph above, we do not believe that the AFS
    debt and marketable equity securities that are in an unrealized
    loss position at December 31, 2010 are
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired.

Residential
    Mortgage Portfolio  

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgages were
    $258.0 billion and $242.1 billion. During 2010 and
    2009, we retained $63.8 billion and $26.6 billion in
    first mortgages originated by  Home Loans  
    Insurance . Outstanding residential mortgage loans increased
    $15.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 as new FHA insured
    origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, the sale of
    $10.8 billion of residential mortgages related to First
    Republic Bank, transfers to foreclosed properties and
    charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans
    pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased
    the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010.

During 2010 and 2009, we securitized $2.4 billion and
    $14.0 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS which
    we retained. We recognized gains of $68 million on
    securitizations completed during 2010. For more information on
    these securitizations, see  Note 8  
    Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010 and 2009, we had
    no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities.
    We sold $443 million of residential mortgages during 2010,
    of which $432 million were originated residential mortgages
    and $11 million were previously purchased from third
    parties. Net gains on these transactions were $21 million.
    This compares to sales of $5.9 billion of residential
    mortgages during 2009 of which $5.1 billion were originated
    residential mortgages and $771 million were previously
    purchased from third parties. These sales resulted in gains of
    $47 million. We received paydowns of $38.2 billion and
    $42.3 billion in 2010 and 2009.

Interest Rate and
    Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts  

Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are
    utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to
    manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use
    derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in
    fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign
    exchange components. For additional information on our hedging
    activities, see  Note 4   Derivatives  to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic
    interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures
    and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts,
    including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency
    forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange
    risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and
    liabilities. Table 55 shows the notional amounts, fair value,
    weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected
    maturity and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These amounts do not include
    derivative hedges on our MSRs.

Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during
    2010 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign
    exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our
    derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of
    economic and financial conditions including the interest rate
    and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and
    trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative
    positions. The notional amount of our option positions increased
    to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010 from
    $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Our interest rate
    swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net
    receive-fixed position of $6.4 billion and
    $52.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    decrease in the net notional levels of our interest rate swap
    position was driven by the net addition of $51.6 billion in
    pay-fixed swaps and $11.5 billion in foreign
    currency-denominated receive-fixed swaps, offset by a reduction
    of $5.6 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated
    receive-fixed swaps. The notional amount of our foreign exchange
    basis swaps was $235.2 billion and $122.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The $112.4 billion
    notional change was primarily due to new trade activity during
    2010 to mitigate cross-currency basis risk on our economic hedge
    portfolio. The increase in pay-fixed swaps resulted from hedging
    newly purchased U.S. Treasury Bonds with swaps and entering
    into additional pay-fixed swaps to hedge variable rate
    short-term liabilities. Our futures and forwards net notional
    position, which reflects the net of long and short positions,
    was a short position of $280 million at December 31,
    2010 compared to a long position of $10.6 billion at
    December 31, 2009.

The table below includes derivatives utilized in our ALM
    activities including those designated as accounting and economic
    hedging instruments. The fair value of net ALM contracts
    increased $329 million to a gain of $12.6 billion at
    December 31, 2010 compared to $12.3 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable
    to changes in the value of U.S. dollar-

denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of
    $3.3 billion, foreign exchange contracts of
    $2.1 billion and foreign exchange basis swaps of
    $197 million. The increase was partially offset by a loss
    from the changes in the value of pay-fixed interest rate swaps
    of $5.0 billion and option products of $294 million.

    foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31,
    2009.

Reflects the net of long and short
    positions.

We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the
    variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities,
    including certain compensation costs and other forecasted
    transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The
    net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments
    recorded in accumulated OCI,
     net-of-tax, 
    were $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. These net losses are expected
    to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the
    hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or
    increase expense on the respective

hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow
    derivative hedge positions and no changes to prices or interest
    rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at
    December 31, 2010 the pre-tax net losses are expected to be
    reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.8 billion, or
    35 percent within the next year, 80 percent within
    five years, and 92 percent within 10 years, with the
    remaining eight percent thereafter. For more information on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see  Note 4
      Derivatives  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We hedge our net investment in
     non-U.S. operations 
    determined to have functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that
    typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency
    basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign
    currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax losses on
    derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated
    OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by
    gains on our net investments in consolidated
     non-U.S. entities 
    at December 31, 2010.

Mortgage
    Banking Risk Management  

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us
    to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We
    determine whether loans will be held for investment or
     held-for-sale 
    at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks
    by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.

Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the
    mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer
    demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity,
    which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income.
    Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an
    increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the
    value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations.
    Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage
    banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and
    ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first
    mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date
    of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary
    market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan
    sale commitments and other derivative instruments including
    purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges
    of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount of
    derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first
    mortgage LHFS was $129.0 billion and $161.4 billion.

MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying
    mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to
    service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest
    rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts,
    Eurodollar futures, as well as mortgage-backed and
    U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The
    notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other
    securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs at
    December 31, 2010 were $1.6 trillion and
    $60.3 billion. At December 31, 2009, the notional
    amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities
    designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $1.3 trillion and
    $67.6 billion. In 2010, we recorded gains in mortgage
    banking income of $5.0 billion related to the change in
    fair value of these economic hedges compared to losses of
    $3.8 billion for 2009. For additional information on MSRs,
    see  Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on
    mortgage banking income, see  Home Loans   Insurance
     beginning on page 41.

Compliance
    Risk Management  

Compliance risk is the risk posed by the failure to manage
    regulatory, legal and ethical issues that could result in
    monetary damages, losses or harm to our reputation or image. The
    Seven Elements of a Compliance
    Program   

    provides the framework for the compliance programs that are
    consistently applied across the Corporation to manage compliance
    risk. This framework includes a common approach to commitment
    and accountability, policies and procedures, controls and
    supervision, monitoring and testing, regulatory change
    management, education and awareness, and reporting.

We approach compliance risk management on an enterprise and line
    of business level. The Operational and Compliance Risk
    Committee, which is a
     sub-committee 
    of the Operational Risk Committee, provides oversight of
    significant compliance risk issues. Within Global Risk
    Management, Global

Compliance Risk Management develops and implements the
    strategies, policies and practices for assessing and managing
    compliance risks across the organization. Through education and
    communication efforts, a culture of compliance is emphasized
    across the organization.

The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within
    the business line, including compliance risks. Compliance risk
    executives monitor and test business processes for compliance
    and escalate risks and issues needing resolution.

Operational
    Risk Management  

The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss
    resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people
    and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur
    anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions,
    and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational
    risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management
    is particularly important to diversified financial services
    companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the
    financial services business. Global banking guidelines and
    country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were
    established in a set of rules known as Basel II. Basel II
    requires banks have internal operational risk management
    processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to
    set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures.

Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an
    event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the
    following seven operational loss event categories: internal
    fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace
    safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to
    physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and
    execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of
    loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing
    errors and physical losses from natural disasters.

We approach operational risk management from two perspectives:
    (1) at the enterprise level and (2) at the line of
    business and enterprise control function levels. The enterprise
    level refers to risk across all of the Corporation. The line of
    business level includes risk in all of the revenue producing
    businesses. Enterprise control functions refer to the business
    units that support the Corporation s business operations.

The Operational Risk Committee oversees and approves the
    Corporation s policies and processes to assure sound
    operational and compliance risk management and serves as an
    escalation point for critical operational risk and compliance
    matters within the Corporation. The Operational Risk Committee
    reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board regarding
    operational risk activities. Within the Global Risk Management
    organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and
    guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and
    monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks
    across the organization as well reporting results to governance
    committees and the Board.

The lines of business and enterprise control functions are
    responsible for all the risks within the business line,
    including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk
    management tools like loss reporting, scenario analysis and risk
    and control self-assessments, operational risk executives,
    working in conjunction with senior line of business executives,
    have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and
    monitor risk in each line of business and enterprise control
    function. Examples of these include personnel management
    practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management
    units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business
    recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The
    lines of business and enterprise control functions are also
    responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring
    adherence to corporate practices. Line of business and
    enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk
    and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the
    status of risk and control

106        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of
    this process is to assess changing market and business
    conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each line of
    business and enterprise control function and assess the controls
    in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self
    assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key
    operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed
    and are used to help identify trends and issues on an
    enterprise, line of business and enterprise control function
    level.

The enterprise control functions participate in two ways to the
    operational risk management process. First, these organizations
    manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide
    specialized risk management services within their area of
    expertise to the enterprise and the lines of business and other
    enterprise control functions they support. For example, the
    Enterprise Information Management and Supply Chain Management
    organizations in the Technology and Operations enterprise
    control function, develop risk management practices, such as
    information security and supplier management programs. These
    groups also work with business and risk executives to develop
    and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls
    and monitoring tools for each line of business and enterprise
    control function relative to these programs.

Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are
    purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and
    if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly
    incorporated in the structural features of operational risk
    evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent
    market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty,
    the inclusion of these insurance policies are subject to
    reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.

Complex
    Accounting Estimates  

Our significant accounting principles, as described in
     Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting
    Principles  to the Consolidated Financial Statements are
    essential in understanding the MD A. Many of our
    significant accounting principles require complex judgments to
    estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have
    procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these
    judgments.

The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following
    discussion. We have identified and described the development of
    the variables most important in the estimation processes that,
    with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models
    to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous
    alternative judgments that could be used in the process of
    determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist,
    we have used the factors that we believe represent the most
    reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance
    that differs from our estimates of the key variables could
    impact net income. Separate from the possible future impact to
    net income from input and model variables, the value of our
    lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities
    may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often
    significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit
    and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may
    change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting
    volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future
    operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of
    deficiencies in our models or inputs.

Allowance for
    Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance
    for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
    commitments, represents management s estimate of probable
    losses inherent in the Corporation s loan portfolio
    excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option.
    Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit
    losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit
    losses is discussed in  Note 1   Summary of
    Significant Accounting Principles  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our
    portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other
    consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers
    of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the
    portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectability
    change with changes in the economy, individual industries,
    countries, and borrowers  or counterparties  ability
    and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which
    any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit
    losses depends on the severity of the change and its
    relationship to the other assumptions.

Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit
    losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and
    leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for
    individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for
    consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for
    consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to
    address current events and conditions, considerations regarding
    domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit
    conditions.

Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is
    sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our
    home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio
    segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on
    loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans
    portfolio segment excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one
    percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans
    individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio
    segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at
    December 31, 2010 would have increased by
    $141 million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio
    segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable
    accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of
    valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However,
    subsequent decreases in the expected principal cash flows from
    the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for
    credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for
    loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress
    scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events.
    A one percent decrease in the expected principal cash flows
    could result in a $297 million impairment of the portfolio,
    of which $138 million would be related to our discontinued
    real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss
    rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our
    credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a
    one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans
    individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio
    segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at
    December 31, 2010 would have increased by $152 million.

Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk
    ratings assigned to loans and leases within our Commercial
    portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the
    internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except
    loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by
    regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses
    would have increased by $6.7 billion at December 31,
    2010. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of
    total loans and leases at December 31, 2010 was
    4.47 percent and this hypothetical increase in the
    allowance would raise the ratio to 5.19 percent.

These sensitivity analyses do not represent management s
    expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the
    increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical
    scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan
    and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk
    ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and
    that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above
    occurring within a short period of time is remote.

The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit
    losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that
    others, given the same information, may at any point in time
    reach different reasonable conclusions.

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights  

MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage
    loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We
    account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair
    value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in
    mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential
    reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization
    method (i.e., lower of cost or market) with impairment
    recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At
    December 31, 2010, our total MSR balance was
    $15.2 billion.

We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a
    valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated
    future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic
    assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and
    resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the
    option-adjusted spread (OAS) levels. These variables can, and
    generally do change from quarter to quarter as market conditions
    and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are
    subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could
    materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing
    the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our
    consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other
    assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated
    increase of $907 million in mortgage banking income at
    December 31, 2010. This impact provided above does not
    reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate
    such risk.

We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a
    comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate
    the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use
    of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of
    earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations,
    securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and
    interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs,
    but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments
    are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
    in mortgage banking income. For more information, see Mortgage
    Banking Risk Management on page 106.

For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of
    weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in
    modeled assumptions, see  Note 25   Mortgage
    Servicing Rights  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Also, for information on the impact of the time to complete
    foreclosure sales on the value of MSRs, see Recent
    Events   Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on
    page 34.

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments  

We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on
    the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance
    which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
    measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes
    three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry
    trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and
    liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain
    MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account
    for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS,
    commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, securities
    financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term
    deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For
    more information, see  Note 22   Fair Value
    Measurements  and  Note 23   Fair Value Option
     to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments
    for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific
    factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models
    or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the
    significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs
    used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation
    date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if
    they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods
    of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity

or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market
    pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation
    process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates
    and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets
    and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls
    that include: a model validation policy that requires review and
    approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial
    statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a
    trading product valuation policy that requires verification of
    all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and
    substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded
    products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both
    broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both
    market-observable and internally-modeled values
     and/or 
    valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered
    by the knowledge of how the broker
     and/or 
    pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of
    reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and
    lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own
    internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable
    are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker
    quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls
    are performed independently of the business.

Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value
    based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from
    either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity
    is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value
    of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes
    may not be readily available for some positions, or positions
    within a market sector where trading activity has slowed
    significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are
    triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a
    single company or a specific market sector. In these instances,
    fair value is determined based on limited available market
    information and other factors, principally from reviewing the
    issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings
    made by one or more of the ratings agencies.

Trading account profits (losses), which represent the net amount
    earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are
    largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand.
    Trading account profits (losses) are dependent on the volume and
    type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the
    volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within
    the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our
    trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential
    volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a
    portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress
    testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a
    potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a
    specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk.
    For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management
    beginning on page 100.

The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in
    the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that
    require the use of multiple market inputs including interest
    rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or
    pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value
    the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted
    and can be validated through external sources including brokers,
    market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation
    risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions
    that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where
    observable market inputs are less readily available or are
    unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of
    rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair
    values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value
    measurements of OTC derivatives the net credit differential
    between the counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk.
    The value of the credit differential is determined by reference
    to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where
    direct references are not available, a proxy is applied
    consistent with direct references for other counterparties that
    are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is
    also used in the

determination of fair value, primarily based on historical
    experience adjusted for any more recent name specific
    expectations.

Level 3
    Assets and Liabilities  

Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on
    prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value
    measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value
    hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The
    Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include private
    equity investments, consumer MSRs, ABS, highly structured,
    complex or long-dated derivative contracts, structured notes and
    certain CDOs, for which there is not an active market for

identical assets from which to determine fair value or where
    sufficient, current market information about similar assets to
    use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs
    into a valuation model is not available. In these cases, the
    fair values of these Level 3 financial assets and
    liabilities are determined using pricing models, discounted cash
    flow methodologies, a net asset value approach for certain
    structured securities, or similar techniques for which the
    determination of fair value requires significant management
    judgment or estimation. In 2010, there were no changes to the
    quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a
    material adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Table
    56   Level 3
    Asset and Liability Summary  

(1)   

Level 3 total assets and
    liabilities are shown before the impact of counterparty netting
    related to our derivative positions.

During 2010, we recognized net gains of $7.1 billion on
    Level 3 assets and liabilities which were primarily gains
    on net derivatives driven by income earned on IRLCs, which are
    considered derivative instruments related to the origination of
    mortgage loans that are
     held-for-sale. 
    These gains were partially offset by changes in the value of
    MSRs as a result of a decline in interest rates and OTTI losses
    on non-agency RMBS. We also recorded pre-tax net unrealized
    losses of $193 million in accumulated OCI on Level 3
    assets and liabilities during 2010, primarily related to
    non-agency RMBS.

Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs,
    may be economically hedged with derivatives not classified as
    Level 3; therefore, gains or losses associated with
    Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or
    losses associated with financial instruments classified in other
    levels of the fair value hierarchy. The gains and losses
    recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our
    liquidity or capital resources.

We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications
    on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are
    made if the significant inputs used in the financial models
    measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became
    unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current
    marketplace. These transfers are effective as of the beginning
    of the quarter.

During 2010, the more significant transfers into Level 3
    included $3.2 billion of trading account assets,
    $3.5 billion of AFS debt securities, $1.1 billion of
    net derivative contracts and $1.9 billion of long-term
    debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets
    were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower
    levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate
    securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in
    valuation

methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow model.
    Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were due to
    an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other taxable
    securities priced using a discounted cash flow model. Transfers
    into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were primarily
    related to a lack of price observability for certain credit
    default and total return swaps. Transfers in and transfers out
    of Level 3 for long-term debt are primarily due to changes
    in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain
    equity-linked structured notes.

During 2010, the more significant transfers out of Level 3
    were $3.4 billion of trading account assets and
    $1.8 billion of long-term debt. Transfers out of
    Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased
    price verification of certain mortgage-backed securities,
    corporate debt and
     non-U.S. government 
    and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for
    long-term debt are the result of a decrease in the significance
    of unobservable pricing inputs for certain equity-linked
    structured notes.

Global Principal
    Investments  

Global Principal Investments is included within Equity
    Investments in  All Other  on page 51. Global
    Principal Investments is comprised of a diversified portfolio of
    private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in
    both privately held and publicly traded companies. These
    investments are made either directly in a company or held
    through a fund. At December 31, 2010, this portfolio
    totaled $11.7 billion including $9.7 billion of
    non-public investments.

Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to
    investment-company accounting under applicable accounting
    guidance, and accordingly,

Bank of America
    2010        109  

Table of Contents   

are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in
    equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the
    investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of
    fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based
    on an assessment of each individual investment using
    methodologies that include publicly traded comparables derived
    by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio
    company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for
    comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level
    multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to
    appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability.
    Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include
    but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of
    financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets.
    For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our
    proportionate interest in the fund s capital as reported by
    the fund s respective managers.

Accrued Income
    Taxes  

Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued
    expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we
    expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions
    attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income
    tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many
    factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory
    guidance ,  in estimating the appropriate accrued income
    taxes for each jurisdiction.

In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor
    relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued
    income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their
    interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These
    revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also
    may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution
    of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating
    results for any given period.

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets  

Background  

The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
    are discussed in  Note 1   Summary of Significant
    Accounting Principles  and  Note 10   Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the
    reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the
    Corporation is performed as of June 30 and in interim periods if
    events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. See
    discussion about the annual impairment test as of June 30,
    2010 on page 111. A reporting unit is a business segment or
    one level below. As reporting units are determined after an
    acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy,
    goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains
    its association with a particular acquisition. All of the
    revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit,
    whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value
    of the goodwill.

The Corporation s common stock price, consistent with
    common stock prices in the financial services industry, remains
    volatile primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the
    financial markets as well as recent financial reforms including
    the Financial Reform Act. Our market capitalization has remained
    below our recorded book value during 2010. The fair value of all
    reporting units in aggregate as of the June 30, 2010 annual
    impairment test was estimated to be $264.4 billion and the
    common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that
    date was $144.2 billion ($134.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010). The implied control premium, which is
    the amount a buyer would be willing to pay over the current
    market price of a publicly traded stock to obtain control, was
    63 percent after taking into consideration the outstanding
    preferred stock of $18.0 billion as of June 30, 2010.
    As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual
    reporting unit fair value determinations are not directly
    correlated to the Corporation s stock price. Although we
    believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization

could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe
    that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization as a
    result of the current economic conditions are reflective of
    actual cash flows and the fair value of our individual reporting
    units.

Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets,
    liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a
    subjective process that involves the use of estimates and
    judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate
    discount rates and an applicable control premium. The fair
    values of the reporting units were determined using a
    combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market
    approach and the income approach and included the use of
    independent valuation specialists. Measurement of the fair
    values of the assets, liabilities and intangibles of a reporting
    unit was consistent with the requirements of the fair value
    measurements accounting guidance and includes the use of
    estimates and judgments. The fair values of the intangible
    assets were determined using the income approach.

The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the
    individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of
    the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from
    comparable publicly traded companies in industries similar to
    that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to
    these multiples varies among the reporting units based upon
    qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size
    and relative profitability of the respective reporting unit
    compared to the comparable publicly traded companies. Since the
    fair values determined under the market approach are
    representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium
    was added to arrive at the reporting units  estimated fair
    values on a controlling basis.

For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted
    cash flows using estimated future cash flows and an appropriate
    terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a
    capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate
    (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The
    inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta,
    which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk
    associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting
    unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an
    unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic
    risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty
    related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the
    uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount
    rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and
    uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically
    in our internally developed forecasts. Expected rates of equity
    returns were estimated based on historical market returns and
    risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit.
    We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and
    actual results may differ from forecasted results.

Global Card
    Services Impairment  

On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into
    law. Under the Financial Reform Act and its amendment to the
    Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve must
    adopt rules within nine months of enactment of the Financial
    Reform Act regarding the interchange fees that may be charged
    with respect to electronic debit transactions. Those rules will
    take effect one year after enactment of the Financial Reform
    Act. The Financial Reform Act and the applicable rules are
    expected to materially reduce the future revenues generated by
    the debit card business of the Corporation.

Our consumer and small business card products, including the
    debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within
     Global Card Services . During the three months ended
    September 30, 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the
    debit card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the
    Financial Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion
    annually based on current volumes. Accordingly, we performed an
    impairment test for  Global Card Services  during the three
    months ended September 30, 2010. In step one of the
    impairment test, the fair value of  Global Card Services
     was estimated under the income approach where the
    significant assumptions included the

110        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

discount rate, terminal value, expected loss rates and expected
    new account growth. We also updated our estimated cash flow
    valuation to reflect the current strategic plan and other
    portfolio assumptions. Based on the results of step one of the
    impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of
     Global Card Services , including goodwill, exceeded the
    fair value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill of the
    reporting unit were $39.2 billion, $25.9 billion and
    $22.3 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed step
    two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In
    step two, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    Under step two of the impairment test, significant assumptions
    in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities
    including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were
    updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the
    results of this third-quarter goodwill impairment test for
     Global Card Services , the carrying value of the goodwill
    assigned to the reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value
    by $10.4 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash,
    non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $10.4 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in
     Global Card Services  from $22.3 billion to
    $11.9 billion. The goodwill impairment test included
    limited mitigation actions to recapture lost revenue. Although
    we have identified other potential mitigation actions within
     Global Card Services , the impact of these actions going
    forward did not reduce the goodwill impairment charge because
    these actions are in the early stages of development and,
    additionally, certain of them may impact segments other than
     Global Card Services  (e.g ., Deposits ). The
    impairment charge had no impact on the Corporation s
    reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios.

Due to the continued stress on  Global Card Services  as a
    result of the Financial Reform Act, we concluded that an
    additional impairment analysis should be performed for this
    reporting unit during the three months ended December 31,
    2010. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair
    value of  Global Card Services  was estimated under the
    income approach. The significant assumptions under the income
    approach included the discount rate, terminal value, expected
    loss rates and expected new account growth. The carrying amount,
    fair value and goodwill for the  Global Card Services
     reporting unit were $27.5 billion, $27.6 billion
    and $11.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value
    as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2010
    was 100 percent. Although fair value exceeded the carrying
    amount in step one of the  Global Card Services  goodwill
    impairment test, to further substantiate the value of goodwill,
    we also performed the step two test for this reporting unit.
    Under step two of the goodwill impairment test for this
    reporting unit, significant assumptions in measuring the fair
    value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit
    including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were
    updated to reflect the current economic conditions. The results
    of step two of the goodwill impairment test indicated that
    remaining balance of goodwill of $11.9 billion was not
    impaired as of December 31, 2010.

On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed
    regulations to implement the Durbin Amendment of the Financial
    Reform Act, which are scheduled to be effective July 21,
    2011. The proposed rule includes two alternative interchange fee
    standards that would apply to all covered issuers: one based on
    each issuer s costs, with a safe harbor initially set at
    $0.07 per transaction and a cap initially set at $0.12 per
    transaction; and the other a stand-alone cap initially set at
    $0.12 per transaction. See Regulatory Matters beginning on
    page 56 for additional information. Although the range of
    revenue loss estimate based on the proposed rule was slightly
    higher than our original estimate of $2.0 billion, given
    the uncertainty around the potential outcome, we did not change
    the revenue loss estimate used in the goodwill impairment test
    during the three months ended December 31, 2010. If the
    final Federal Reserve rule sets interchange fee standards that
    are significantly lower than the interchange fee assumptions we
    used in this goodwill impairment test, we will be required to
    perform an additional goodwill impairment

test which may result in additional impairment of goodwill in
     Global Card Services.  In view of the uncertainty with
    model inputs including the final ruling, changes in the economic
    outlook and the corresponding impact to revenues and asset
    quality, and the impacts of mitigation actions, it is not
    possible to estimate the amount or range of amounts of
    additional goodwill impairment, if any.

Home
    Loans   Insurance Impairment  

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we
    performed an impairment test for the  Home Loans  
    Insurance  reporting unit as it was likely that there was a
    decline in its fair value as a result of increased
    uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation
    exposure and other related risks, higher current servicing costs
    including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues
    and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address
    servicing needs. In step one of the goodwill impairment test,
    the fair value of  Home Loans   Insurance  was
    estimated based on a combination of the market approach and the
    income approach. Under the market approach valuation,
    significant assumptions included market multiples and a control
    premium. The significant assumptions for the valuation of
     Home Loans   Insurance  under the income
    approach included cash flow estimates, the discount rate and the
    terminal value. These assumptions were updated to reflect the
    current strategic plan forecast and to address the increased
    uncertainties referenced above. Based on the results of step one
    of the impairment test ,  we determined that the carrying
    amount of  Home Loans   Insurance , including
    goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying amount, fair
    value and goodwill for the  Home Loans   Insurance
     reporting unit were $24.7 billion, $15.1 billion
    and $4.8 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed
    step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting
    unit. In step two, we compared the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
    goodwill. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test,
    significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the
    assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount
    rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the
    current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of
    the impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned
    to  Home Loans   Insurance  exceeded the implied
    fair value by $2.0 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a
    non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 to reduce the
    carrying value of goodwill in the  Home Loans  
    Insurance  reporting unit. The impairment charge had no
    impact on the Corporation s Tier 1 and tangible equity
    ratios.

As we obtain additional information relative to our litigation
    exposure, representations and warranties repurchase obligations,
    servicing costs and foreclosure related issues, it is possible
    that such information, if significantly different than the
    assumptions used in this goodwill impairment test, may result in
    additional impairment in the  Home Loans   Insurance
     reporting unit.

Annual Impairment
    Test for 2010  

We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting
    units as of June 30 each year. In performing the first step of
    the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test, we compared the
    fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying
    amount, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized
    a combination of a market approach and an income approach. Under
    the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples
    of the individual reporting units to multiples of publicly
    traded companies comparable to the individual reporting units.
    The control premiums used in the June 30, 2010 annual
    impairment test ranged from 25 to 35 percent. Under the
    income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the
    current market environment. The discount rates used in the
    June 30, 2010 annual impairment test ranged from 11 to
    15 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting
    unit. Because growth rates developed by management for

Bank of America
    2010        111  

Table of Contents   

individual revenue and expense items have been significantly
    affected by the current economic environment and financial
    reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts. The
    fair value of  Global Card Services  was estimated under
    the income approach which did not include the impact of any
    potential future changes that would result from the Financial
    Reform Act because it was not signed into law until the third
    quarter 2010.

Based on the results of step one of the annual impairment test,
    we determined that the carrying amount of the  Home
    Loans   Insurance  and  Global Card Services
     reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded their fair
    value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the
     Home Loans   Insurance  reporting unit were
    $27.1 billion, $22.5 billion and $4.8 billion,
    respectively, and for  Global Card Services  were
    $40.1 billion, $40.1 billion and $22.3 billion,
    respectively. Because the carrying amount exceeded the fair
    value, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for
    these reporting units as of June 30, 2010. For all other
    reporting units, step two was not required as their fair value
    exceeded their carrying amount indicating there was no
    impairment.

In step two for both reporting units, we compared the implied
    fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the
    carrying amount of that goodwill. We determined the implied fair
    value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair
    value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities
    of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as
    if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit
    over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the
    implied fair value of goodwill. Significant assumptions in
    measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of both
    reporting units including discount rates, loss rates and
    interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic
    conditions. Based on the results of step two of the impairment
    test as of June 30, 2010, we determined that goodwill was
    not impaired in either  Home Loans   Insurance 
    or  Global Card Services .

Representations
    and Warranties  

The methodology used to estimate the liability for
    representations and warranties is a function of the
    representations and warranties given and considers a variety of
    factors, which include depending upon the counterparty, actual
    defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience,
    estimated home prices, estimated probability that we will
    receive a repurchase request, number of payments made by the
    borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will
    be required to repurchase a loan. Changes to any one of these
    factors could significantly impact the estimate of our
    liability. Representations and warranties provision may vary
    significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate
    the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type
    of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest
    experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant
    facts and circumstances. For those claims where we have
    established a representations and warranties liability as
    discussed in  Note 9   Representations and
    Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an assumed simultaneous
    increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future
    defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result
    in an increase of approximately $850 million or decrease of
    approximately $950 million in the representations and
    warranties liability as of December 31, 2010. These
    sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an
    indication of the impact of a significant change in these key
    assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In
    reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in
    other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the
    sensitivity.

For additional information on representations and warranties,
    see Representations and Warranties on page 52,
     Note 9   Representations and Warranties Obligations
    and Corporate Guarantees  and  Note 14  
    Commitments and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Litigation
    Reserve  

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the
    Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and
    regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies
    that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may
    be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a
    loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the
    Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a
    litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in
    conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,
    evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a
    loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the
    time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation
    or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the
    matter will continue to be monitored for further developments
    that would make such loss contingency both probable and
    estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or
    regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable,
    the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect
    to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of
    litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to
    monitor the matter for further developments that could affect
    the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously
    established.

For a limited number of the matters disclosed in  Note 14
      Commitments and Contingencies  to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for which a loss is probable or reasonably
    possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related
    accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are
    able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining
    whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range
    of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its
    material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis,
    in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in
    light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.
    These may include information learned through the discovery
    process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions,
    and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in
    which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to
    develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that
    estimate is aggregated and disclosed in  Note 14  
    Commitments and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is
    probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not
    possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible
    are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the
    estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to
    be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting
    these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation s
    maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in
     Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies  to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the nature of all of
    these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the
    claim associated with these loss contingencies.

Consolidation and
    Accounting for Variable Interest Entities  

The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is
    referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.
    In accordance with the new consolidation guidance effective
    January 1, 2010, the Corporation is deemed to have a
    controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of
    a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the
    VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic
    performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to
    receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE.

112        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial
    interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must
    assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and
    implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity s
    involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing
    activities. The entity must then determine which activities have
    the most significant impact on the economic performance of the
    VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such
    activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that
    services the assets or makes investment management decisions may
    have the power to direct the most significant activities of a
    VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right
    to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate
    the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are
    no significant ongoing activities, the party that was
    responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have
    power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct
    the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must
    determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the
    right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant
    to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in
    debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity
    commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees.

On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling
    financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The
    quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have
    acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the
    VIE through changes in governing documents or other
    circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have
    acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be
    significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has
    become significant or is no longer significant. The
    consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may
    change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in
    consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and
    liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at
    fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon
    deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of
    deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value
    of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.

2009
    Compared to 2008  

The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of
    our results of operations for 2009 and 2008. This discussion
    should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and related Notes. Tables 6 and 7 contain financial
    data to supplement this discussion.

Overview  

Net
    Income  

Net income totaled $6.3 billion in 2009 compared to
    $4.0 billion in 2008. Including preferred stock dividends,
    net loss applicable to common shareholders was
    $2.2 billion, or $(0.29) per diluted share. Those results
    compared with 2008 net income available to common
    shareholders of $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share.

Net Interest
    Income  

Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.9 billion
    to $48.4 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase
    was driven by the improved rate environment, the acquisitions of
    Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the impact of new draws on
    previously securitized accounts and the contribution from
    market-based net interest income which benefited from the
    Merrill Lynch acquisition. These items were partially offset by
    the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009,
    lower consumer loan levels and the adverse impact of
    nonperforming loans. The net interest yield on a FTE basis
    decreased 33 bps to 2.65 percent for 2009 compared to
    2008 due to the factors related to the core businesses as
    described above.

Noninterest
    Income  

Noninterest income increased $45.1 billion to
    $72.5 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Card income on a
    held basis decreased $5.0 billion primarily due to higher
    credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee
    income driven by changes in consumer retail purchase and payment
    behavior in the stressed economic environment. Investment and
    brokerage services increased $6.9 billion primarily due to
    the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by the impact
    of lower valuations in the equity markets driven by the market
    downturn in late 2008, which improved modestly in 2009, and net
    outflows in the cash funds. Investment banking income increased
    $3.3 billion due to higher debt, equity and advisory fees
    reflecting the increased size of the investment banking platform
    from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Equity investment income
    increased $9.5 billion driven by $7.3 billion in gains
    on sales of portions of our CCB investment and a
    $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment.
    Trading account profits (losses) increased $18.1 billion
    primarily driven by favorable core trading results and reduced
    write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by negative credit
    valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of
    $662 million due to improvement in the Corporation s
    credit spreads. Mortgage banking income increased
    $4.7 billion driven by higher production and servicing
    income of $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. These
    increases were primarily due to increased volume as a result of
    the full-year impact of Countrywide and higher refinance
    activity partially offset by lower MSR results, net of hedges.
    Gains on sales of debt securities increased $3.6 billion
    due to the favorable interest rate environment and improved
    credit spreads. Gains were primarily driven by sales of agency
    MBS and CMOs. The net loss in other decreased $1.6 billion
    primarily due to the $3.8 billion gain from the
    contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint
    venture, reduced support provided to cash funds and lower
    write-downs on legacy assets offset by negative credit valuation
    adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes of
    $4.9 billion.

Provision for
    Credit Losses  

The provision for credit losses increased $21.7 billion to
    $48.6 billion for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting further
    deterioration in the economy and housing markets across a broad
    range of property types, industries and borrowers. Net
    charge-offs totaled $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent of
    average loans and leases for 2009 compared with
    $16.2 billion, or 1.79 percent for 2008. The increased
    level of net charge-offs is a result of the same factors noted
    above.

Noninterest
    Expense  

Noninterest expense increased $25.2 billion to
    $66.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. Personnel costs
    and other general operating expenses rose due to the addition of
    Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide.
    Additionally, noninterest expense increased due to higher
    litigation costs compared to the prior year, a $425 million
    pre-tax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its
    asset guarantee term sheet and higher FDIC insurance costs
    including a $724 million special assessment in 2009.

Income Tax
    Expense  

Income tax benefit was $1.9 billion for 2009 compared to
    expense of $420 million for 2008 and resulted in an
    effective tax rate of (44.0) percent compared to
    9.5 percent in the prior year. The change in the effective
    tax rate from the prior year was due to increased permanent tax
    preference items as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our
    earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch.

Table of Contents   

Business
    Segment Operations  

Deposits  

Net income decreased $3.0 billion to $2.6 billion
    driven by lower net revenue partially offset by an increase in
    noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased
    $3.8 billion driven by lower net interest income allocation
    from ALM activities and spread compression as interest rates
    declined. Noninterest income was essentially flat at
    $6.8 billion. Noninterest expense increased
    $908 million to $9.5 billion primarily due to higher
    FDIC insurance including a special FDIC assessment, partially
    offset by lower operating costs related to lower transaction
    volume due to the economy and productivity initiatives.

Global Card
    Services  

Net income decreased $6.8 billion to a net loss of
    $5.3 billion due to higher provision for credit losses. Net
    interest income grew $667 million to $20.0 billion
    driven by increased loan spreads. Noninterest income decreased
    $2.6 billion to $9.1 billion driven by decreases in
    card income and all other income. The decrease in card income
    resulted from lower cash advances, credit card interchange and
    fee income. All other income in 2008 included the gain
    associated with the Visa initial public offering (IPO).
    Provision for credit losses increased $10.0 billion to
    $29.6 billion primarily driven by higher losses in the
    consumer card and consumer lending portfolios from impact of the
    economic conditions. Noninterest expense decreased
    $1.2 billion to $7.7 billion primarily due to lower
    operating and marketing costs, and the impact of certain
    benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions.

Home
    Loans   Insurance  

Home Loans   Insurance  net loss increased
    $1.3 billion to a net loss of $3.9 billion as growth
    in noninterest income and net interest income was more than
    offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in
    noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $1.7 billion
    driven primarily by an increase in average LHFS and home equity
    loans. The growth in average LHFS was a result of higher
    mortgage loan volume driven by the lower interest rate
    environment. The growth in average home equity loans was
    attributable to the migration of certain loans from  GWIM
     to  Home Loans   Insurance  as well as the
    Countrywide acquisition. Noninterest income increased
    $5.9 billion to $11.9 billion driven by higher
    mortgage banking income which benefited from the Countrywide
    acquisition and higher production income, partially offset by
    higher representations and warranties provision. Provision for
    credit losses increased $5.0 billion to $11.2 billion
    driven primarily by higher losses in the home equity portfolio
    and reserve increases in the Countrywide home equity PCI
    portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $4.7 billion to
    $11.7 billion primarily driven by the Countrywide
    acquisition as well as increased costs related to higher
    production volume.

Global Commercial
    Banking  

Net income decreased $2.9 billion to a net loss of
    $290 million in 2009 as an increase in revenue was more
    than offset by increased credit costs. Net interest income was
    essentially flat at $8.1 billion. Noninterest income
    increased $552 million to $3.1 billion largely driven
    by our agreement to

purchase certain retail automotive loans. The provision for
    credit losses increased $4.5 billion to $7.8 billion,
    driven by reserve additions primarily in the commercial real
    estate portfolio and higher net charge-offs across all
    portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $501 million
    primarily attributable to higher FDIC insurance, including a
    special FDIC assessment.

Global
    Banking   Markets  

Global Banking   Markets  recognized net income
    of $10.1 billion in 2009 compared to a net loss of
    $3.2 billion in 2008 as increased noninterest income driven
    by trading account profits was partially offset by higher
    noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue was
    $17.6 billion in 2009 compared to a loss of
    $6.9 billion in 2008 primarily due to the addition of
    Merrill Lynch. Noninterest income also included a
    $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of
    the merchant processing business into a joint venture.
    Noninterest expense increased $8.6 billion, largely
    attributable to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.

Net income increased $702 million to $1.7 billion in
    2009 as higher total revenue was partially offset by increases
    in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net
    interest income increased $1.2 billion to $6.0 billion
    primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Noninterest
    income increased $8.6 billion to $10.1 billion
    primarily due to higher investment and brokerage services income
    and the lower level of support provided to certain cash funds,
    partially offset by the impact of lower average equity market
    levels and net outflows primarily in the cash complex. Provision
    for credit losses increased $397 million to
    $1.1 billion, reflecting the weak economy during 2009 which
    drove higher net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and
    commercial portfolios. Noninterest expense increased
    $8.3 billion to $12.4 billion driven by the addition
    of Merrill Lynch and higher FDIC insurance, including a special
    FDIC assessment, partially offset by lower revenue-related
    expenses.

All
    Other  

Net income in  All Other  was $1.3 billion in 2009
    compared to a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2008 as higher
    total revenue driven by increases in noninterest income, net
    interest income and an income tax benefit were partially offset
    by increased provision for credit losses, merger and
    restructuring charges and all other noninterest expense. Net
    interest income increased $1.5 billion primarily due to
    unallocated net interest income related to increased liquidity
    driven in part by capital raises during 2009. Noninterest income
    increased $8.2 billion to $10.6 billion driven by
    higher equity investment income including a $7.3 billion
    gain on the sale of a portion of our CCB investment and gains on
    sales of debt securities. These were partially offset by a
    $4.9 billion negative valuation adjustment on certain
    structured liabilities. Provision for credit losses was
    $8.0 billion in 2009 compared to $2.8 billion in 2008
    primarily due to higher credit costs related to our ALM
    residential mortgage portfolio. Merger and restructuring charges
    increased $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion due to the
    integration costs associated with the Merrill Lynch and
    Countrywide acquisitions.

Glossary  

Alt-A Mortgage    Alternative-A mortgage, a type
    of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered
    riskier than A-paper, or  prime,  and less risky than
     subprime,  the riskiest category. Alt-A interest
    rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be
    between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A
    mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full
    documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.

Assets in Custody    Consist largely of
    custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage
    assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad
    range of asset types including real estate, private company
    ownership interest, personal property and investments.

Assets Under Management (AUM)    The total
    market value of assets under the investment advisory and
    discretion of  GWIM  which generate asset management fees
    based on a percentage of the assets  market values. AUM
    reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional,
    high net-worth and retail clients and are distributed through
    various investment products including mutual funds, other
    commingled vehicles and separate accounts.

Bridge Financing    A loan or security that is
    expected to be replaced by permanent financing (debt or equity
    securities, loan syndication or asset sales) prior to the
    maturity date of the loan. Bridge loans may include an unfunded
    commitment, as well as funded amounts, and are generally
    expected to be retired in one year or less.

Client Brokerage Assets    Include client assets
    which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes
    non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate
    brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.

Client Deposits    Includes  GWIM  client
    deposit accounts representing both consumer and commercial
    demand, regular savings, time, money market, sweep and
     non-U.S. accounts. 

Committed Credit Exposure    Includes any funded
    portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on
    which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a
    specified period under prescribed conditions.

Core Net Interest Income    Net interest income
    on a fully taxable-equivalent basis excluding the impact of
    market-based activities.

Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act
    of 2009 (CARD Act)    Legislation signed into law
    on May 22, 2009 to provide changes to credit card industry
    practices including significantly restricting credit card
    issuers  ability to change interest rates and assess fees
    to reflect individual consumer risk, change the way payments are
    applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card
    disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective in
    February 2010.

Credit Default Swap (CDS)    A derivative
    contract that provides protection against the deterioration of
    credit quality and allows one party to receive payment in the
    event of default by a third party under a borrowing arrangement.

Excess Servicing Income    For certain assets
    that have been securitized, interest income, fee revenue and
    recoveries in excess of interest paid to the investors, gross
    credit losses and other trust expenses related to the
    securitized receivables are all classified as excess servicing
    income, which is a component of card income. Excess servicing
    income also includes the changes in fair value of the
    Corporation s card-related retained interests.

Interest-only Strip    A residual interest in a
    securitization trust representing the right to receive future
    net cash flows from securitized assets after payments to
    third-party investors and net credit losses. These arise when
    assets are transferred to a SPE as part of an asset
    securitization transaction qualifying for sale treatment under
    GAAP.

Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC)   
    Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms,
    including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a
    designated period of time subject to credit approval.

Letter of Credit    A document issued on behalf
    of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party
    upon presentation of specified documents. A

letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer s
    credit for that of the customer.

Loan-to-value 
    (LTV)    A commonly used credit quality metric that
    is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is
    calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the
    end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property
    securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily
    determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely
    used index based on data from repeat sales of single family
    homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are
    reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional
    metric related to LTV is combined
     loan-to-value 
    (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the
    outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the
    outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available
    line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property,
    divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of
    100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a
    property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value
    or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances,
    estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an
    automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment
    Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the
    value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data
    including sales of comparable properties and price trends
    specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is
    located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home
    Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat
    sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag.

Making Home Affordable Program (MHA)    A
    U.S. Treasury program to reduce the number of foreclosures
    and make it easier for homeowners to refinance loans. The
    program is comprised of the Home Affordable Modification Program
    (HAMP) which provides guidelines on loan modifications and is
    designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by
    reducing monthly mortgage payments and provides incentives to
    lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the program
    guidelines and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)
    which is available to homeowners who have a proven payment
    history on an existing mortgage owned by FNMA or FHLMC and is
    designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage
    loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to
    refinance ARMs into more stable fixed-rate mortgages. In
    addition, the Second Lien Program is a part of the MHA. For more
    information on this program, see the separate definition for the
    Second Lien Program.

Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR)    The right to
    service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or
    securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal,
    interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for
    and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.

Net Interest Yield    Net interest income
    divided by average total interest-earning assets.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases    Includes loans
    and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including
    nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured
    in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing
    financial difficulties (troubled debt restructurings or TDRs).
    Loans accounted for under the fair value option, purchased
    credit-impaired loans and loans
     held-for-sale 
    are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer
    credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans not
    secured by real estate, and consumer loans secured by real
    estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing
    Administration are not placed on nonaccrual status and are,
    therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.

Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan    A loan
    purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a
    business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit
    quality since origination for which it is probable, upon

132        Bank

acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all
    contractually required payments. These loans are written down to
    fair value at the acquisition date.

Second Lien Program (2MP)    A MHA program
    announced on April 28, 2009 by the U.S. Treasury that
    focuses on creating a comprehensive affordability solution for
    homeowners. By focusing on shared efforts with lenders to reduce
    second mortgage payments,
     pay-for-success 
    incentives for servicers, investors and borrowers, and a payment
    schedule for extinguishing second mortgages, the 2MP is designed
    to help up to 1.5 million homeowners. The program is
    designed to ensure that first and second lien holders are
    treated fairly and consistently with priority of liens, and
    offers automatic modification of a second lien when a first lien
    is modified.

Subprime Loans    Although a standard industry
    definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage
    loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as
    specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including
    individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk
    factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and
    inferior payment history.

Super Senior CDO Exposure    Represents the most
    senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO
    vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the
    subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated
    securities, issued by CDO vehicles.

Tier 1 Common Capital    Tier 1
    capital including CES, less preferred stock, qualifying trust
    preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying
    noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)    A
    program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 by the U.S. Treasury to, among other things,
    invest in financial institutions through capital infusions and
    purchase mortgages, MBS and certain other financial instruments
    from financial institutions, in an aggregate amount up to
    $700 billion, for the purpose of stabilizing and providing
    liquidity to the U.S. financial markets.

Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)    Loans
    whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that
    grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial
    difficulties. Concessions could include a reduction in the
    interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of
    principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize
    collection. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans
    and leases while on nonaccrual status. TDRs that are on accrual
    status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the
    calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in
    which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if
    accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the
    time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs
    throughout their remaining lives.

Value-at-Risk 
    (VaR)    A VaR model estimates a range of
    hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is
    not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level.
    VaR is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk.

    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  

Report of
    Management on Internal Control 
    Over Financial Reporting  

The management of Bank of America Corporation is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting.

The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting
    is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The Corporation s internal control over financial
    reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 based on the

framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control  
    Integrated Framework . Based on that assessment, management
    concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation s internal control over financial reporting is
    effective based on the criteria established in  Internal
    Control   Integrated Framework .

The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which
    expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of
    Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America
    Corporation:  

In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and
    the related Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated
    Statement of Changes in Shareholders  Equity and
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Bank of America
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
     Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Corporation s management is
    responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Corporation s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material

weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
    operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1  Summary
    of Significant Accounting Principles   

Bank of America Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries,
    the Corporation), a financial holding company, provides a
    diverse range of financial services and products throughout the
    U.S. and in certain international markets. The term
     the Corporation  as used herein may refer to the
    Corporation individually, the Corporation and its subsidiaries,
    or certain of the Corporation s subsidiaries or affiliates.

The Corporation conducts its activities through banking and
    nonbanking subsidiaries. On January 1, 2009, the
    Corporation acquired Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc.
    (Merrill Lynch) in exchange for common and preferred stock with
    a value of $29.1 billion. The Corporation operates its
    banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of
    America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A.) and FIA
    Card Services, N.A. In connection with certain acquisitions
    including Merrill Lynch, the Corporation acquired banking
    subsidiaries that have been merged into Bank of America, N.A.
    with no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
    Corporation.

Principles of
    Consolidation and Basis of Presentation  

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those
    variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the
    primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are
    included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the
    dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary.
    Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included
    in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation
    accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting
    interest of 20 percent to 50 percent and for which it
    has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
    and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting or
    at fair value under the fair value option. These investments are
    included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject
    to impairment testing and the Corporation s proportionate
    share of income or loss is included in equity investment income.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
    disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates
    and assumptions.

The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of
    filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
    Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to current period presentation.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements  

In March 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued new accounting guidance on embedded credit derivatives.
    This new accounting guidance clarifies the scope exception for
    embedded credit derivatives and defines which embedded credit
    derivatives are required to be evaluated for bifurcation and
    separate accounting. In addition, the guidance extends the
    current disclosure requirements for credit derivatives to all
    securities with potential embedded derivative features
    regardless of the accounting treatment. This new accounting
    guidance was effective on July 1, 2010. Upon adoption,
    companies may elect the fair value option for any beneficial
    interests, including those that would otherwise require
    bifurcation under the new

guidance. In connection with the adoption of the guidance on
    July 1, 2010, the Corporation elected the fair value option
    for $629 million of AFS debt securities, principally
    collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), that otherwise may be
    subject to bifurcation under the new guidance. In connection
    with this election, the Corporation recorded a $229 million
    charge to retained earnings on July 1, 2010 as an after-tax
    adjustment to reclassify the net unrealized loss on these AFS
    debt securities from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (OCI) to retained earnings and they were reclassified to trading
    account assets. The Corporation did not bifurcate any securities
    as a result of adopting the new accounting guidance. The
    additional disclosures required by this new guidance are
    included in  Note 4   Derivatives .

On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new FASB
    accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets and
    consolidation of VIEs. This new accounting guidance revised sale
    accounting criteria for transfers of financial assets,
    eliminated the concept of and accounting for qualifying special
    purpose entities (QSPEs) and significantly changed the criteria
    for consolidation of a VIE. The adoption of this new accounting
    guidance resulted in the consolidation of certain VIEs that
    previously were QSPEs and VIEs that were not recorded on the
    Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to
    January 1, 2010. The adoption of this new accounting
    guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of
    $100.4 billion and a net increase in liabilities of
    $106.7 billion. These amounts are net of retained interests
    in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 2009 and net of a $10.8 billion increase
    in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Corporation
    recorded a $6.2 billion charge,
     net-of-tax, 
    to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative
    effect of the adoption of this new accounting guidance, which
    resulted principally from an increase in the allowance for loan
    and lease losses related to the newly consolidated loans, and a
    $116 million charge to accumulated OCI. Initial recording
    of these assets, related allowance and liabilities on the
    Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at
    the date of adoption on the consolidated results of operations.

On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted, on a
    prospective basis, new FASB accounting guidance stating that
    troubled debt restructuring (TDR) accounting cannot be applied
    to individual loans within purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan
    pools. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
    impact on the Corporation s consolidated financial
    condition or results of operations.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in
    the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent
    banks and the Federal Reserve Bank.

Securities
    Financing Agreements  

Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and
    securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase
    (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized
    financing transactions. These agreements are recorded at the
    amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus
    accrued interest, except for certain securities financing
    agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair
    value option. Changes in the fair value of securities financing
    agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option
    are recorded in other income (loss). For more

    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

information on securities financing agreements that the
    Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, see
     Note 23   Fair Value Option .

The Corporation s policy is to obtain possession of
    collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the
    principal amount loaned under resale agreements. To ensure that
    the market value of the underlying collateral remains
    sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily and the
    Corporation may require counterparties to deposit additional
    collateral or may return collateral pledged when appropriate.
    Securities financing agreements give rise to negligible credit
    risk as a result of these collateral provisions, and
    accordingly, no allowance for loan losses is considered
    necessary.

Substantially all repurchase and resale activities are
    transacted under master repurchase agreements which give the
    Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the
    right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and
    payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets
    repurchase and resale transactions with the same counterparty on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a master
    agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.

In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a
    securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be
    pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the
    securities received, and a liability for the same amount,
    representing the obligation to return those securities.

At the end of certain quarterly periods during the three years
    ended December 31, 2009, the Corporation had recorded
    certain sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) which,
    based on an ongoing internal review and interpretation, should
    have been recorded as secured borrowings. These periods and
    amounts were as follows: March 31,
    2009   $573 million; September 30,
    2008   $10.7 billion; December 31,
    2007   $2.1 billion; and March 31,
    2007   $4.5 billion. As the transferred
    securities were recorded at fair value in trading account
    assets, the change would have had no impact on consolidated
    results of operations. Had the sales been recorded as secured
    borrowings, trading account assets and federal funds purchased
    and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase
    would have increased by the amount of the transactions, however,
    the increase in all cases was less than 0.7 percent of
    total assets or total liabilities. Accordingly, the Corporation
    believes that these transactions did not have a material impact
    on the Corporation s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In repurchase transactions, typically, the termination date for
    a repurchase agreement is before the maturity date of the
    underlying security. However, in certain situations, the
    Corporation may enter into repurchase agreements where the
    termination date of the repurchase transaction is the same as
    the maturity date of the underlying security and these
    transactions are referred to as
      repo-to-maturity  
    (RTM) transactions. The Corporation enters into RTM transactions
    only for high quality, very liquid securities such as
    U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury)
    securities or securities issued by government-sponsored
    enterprises (GSE). The Corporation accounts for RTM transactions
    as sales in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and
    accordingly, removes the securities from the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet and recognizes a gain or loss in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation
    had no outstanding RTM transactions compared to
    $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009, that had been
    accounted for as sales.

Collateral  

The Corporation accepts collateral that it is permitted by
    contract or custom to sell or repledge and such collateral is
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the fair value of this collateral was
    $401.7 billion and $418.2 billion of which
    $257.6 billion and $310.2 billion were sold or
    repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are repurchase
    agreements and securities borrowed. The Corporation also pledges
    securities

and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase
    agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits,
    U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and other short-term
    borrowings. This collateral can be sold or repledged by the
    counterparties to the transactions.

In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection
    with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary
    depending on the credit risk rating and the type of
    counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in
    the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other
    marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in legal
    netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral against
    the applicable derivative fair value. The Corporation also
    pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be
    applied against derivative liabilities.

Trading
    Instruments  

Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried
    at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market
    prices or quoted market prices for similar assets and
    liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair
    values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where
    the determination of fair value may require significant
    management judgment or estimation. Realized and unrealized gains
    and losses are recognized in trading account profits (losses).

Derivatives and
    Hedging Activities  

Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for
    trading, as economic hedges or as qualifying accounting hedges.
    Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial
    futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts.
    A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange
    cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts,
    assets
     and/or 
    indices. Financial futures and forward settlement contracts are
    agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument,
    index, currency or commodity at a predetermined future date, and
    rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys
    to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
    sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including another
    derivative financial instrument), index, currency or commodity
    at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a date in
    the future. Option agreements can be transacted on organized
    exchanges or directly between parties.

All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally
    enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation
    to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash
    collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For
    exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market
    prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based
    on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow
    methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination
    of fair value may require significant management judgment or
    estimation.

Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the
    value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk.
    These values also take into account the Corporation s own
    credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the
    derivative instrument the value of the net credit differential
    between the counterparties to the derivative contract.

Trading
    Derivatives and Economic Hedges  

Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative
    assets or derivative liabilities with changes in fair value
    included in trading account profits (losses).

Derivatives used as economic hedges, because either they did not
    qualify for or were not designated as an accounting hedge, are
    also included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities.
    Changes in the fair value of

derivatives that serve as economic hedges of mortgage servicing
    rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first
    mortgage loans
     held-for-sale 
    (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in
    mortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that serve as asset and liability management (ALM)
    economic hedges are recorded in other income (loss). Credit
    derivatives used by the Corporation as economic hedges do not
    qualify as accounting hedges despite being effective economic
    hedges, and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
    included in other income (loss).

Derivatives Used
    For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)  

For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at
    inception all relationships between hedging instruments and
    hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and
    strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges.
    Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis
    at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period
    thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in a hedging
    transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in
    offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged
    item. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is
    determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased
    to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in
    fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of
    the hedge relationship.

The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair value
    hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign
    operations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign
    currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use
    of derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against
    changes in the fair value of the Corporation s assets and
    liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign
    exchange volatility. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to
    minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities,
    or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign
    exchange fluctuations. For terminated cash flow hedges, the
    maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are
    hedged is 26 years, with a substantial portion of the
    hedged transactions being less than 10 years. For open or
    future cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which
    forecasted transactions are or will be hedged is less than seven
    years.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair
    value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same
    income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the
    related hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated OCI
    and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement
    in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period the
    hedged item affects earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness and gains
    and losses on the excluded component of a derivative in
    assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in earnings in the
    same income statement line item. The Corporation records changes
    in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net
    investment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a
    component of accumulated OCI.

If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated
    or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to
    the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability are
    subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other
    components of the carrying amount of that asset or liability.
    For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,
    such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining
    life of the respective asset or liability. If a derivative
    instrument in a cash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge
    designation is removed, related amounts in accumulated OCI are
    reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during
    which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If it
    is probable that a

forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in
    accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in that period.

Interest Rate
    Lock Commitments  

The Corporation enters into IRLCs in connection with its
    mortgage banking activities to fund residential mortgage loans
    at specified times in the future. IRLCs that relate to the
    origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are
    considered derivative instruments under applicable accounting
    guidance. As such, these IRLCs are recorded at fair value with
    changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income.

In estimating the fair value of an IRLC, the Corporation assigns
    a probability to the loan commitment based on an expectation
    that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. The fair
    value of the commitments is derived from the fair value of
    related mortgage loans which is based on observable market data
    and includes the expected net future cash flows related to
    servicing of the loans. Changes to the fair value of IRLCs are
    recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the
    probability that the commitment will be exercised and the
    passage of time. Changes from the expected future cash flows
    related to the customer relationship are excluded from the
    valuation of IRLCs.

Outstanding IRLCs expose the Corporation to the risk that the
    price of the loans underlying the commitments might decline from
    inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan. To protect
    against this risk, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sales
    commitments and other derivative instruments, including interest
    rate swaps and options, to economically hedge the risk of
    potential changes in the value of the loans that would result
    from the commitments. The changes in the fair value of these
    derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income.

Securities  

Debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as of the trade date and classified based on management s
    intention on the date of purchase. Debt securities which
    management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are
    classified as
     held-to-maturity 
    (HTM) and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities that are
    bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the
    near term are classified as trading and are carried at fair
    value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading
    account profits (losses). Other debt securities are classified
    as AFS and carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and
    losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. In
    addition, credit-related notes, which include investments in
    securities issued by CDOs, collateralized loan obligations
    (CLOs) and credit-linked note vehicles, are classified as
    trading securities.

The Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debt
    security where the value has declined below amortized cost to
    assess whether the decline in fair value is
     other-than-temporary. 
    In determining whether an impairment is
     other-than-temporary, 
    the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the
    decline in fair value, the length of time expected for recovery,
    the financial condition of the issuer, and other qualitative
    factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell
    the security or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be
    required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
    cost. Beginning in 2009, under new accounting guidance for
    impairments of debt securities that are deemed to be
     other-than-temporary, 
    the credit component of an
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment (OTTI) loss is recognized in earnings and the
    non-credit component is recognized in accumulated OCI in
    situations where the Corporation does not intend to sell the
    security and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Corporation
    will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Prior
    to January 1, 2009, unrealized losses, both the credit and
    non-credit components, on AFS debt securities that were deemed
    to be
     other-than-temporary 
    were included in current-period earnings. If there is an OTTI on
    any individual security classified as HTM, the

144        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

Corporation writes down the security to fair value with a
    corresponding charge to other income (loss).

Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums
    and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income.
    Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities,
    which are included in gains (losses) on sales of debt
    securities, are determined using the specific identification
    method.

Marketable equity securities are classified based on
    management s intention on the date of purchase and recorded
    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the trade date.
    Marketable equity securities that are bought and held
    principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are
    classified as trading and are carried at fair value with
    unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits
    (losses). Other marketable equity securities are accounted for
    as AFS and classified in other assets. All AFS marketable equity
    securities are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains
    and losses included in accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. If
    there is an
     other-than-temporary 
    decline in the fair value of any individual AFS marketable
    equity security, the Corporation reclassifies the associated net
    unrealized loss out of accumulated OCI with a corresponding
    charge to equity investment income. Dividend income on AFS
    marketable equity securities is included in equity investment
    income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of all AFS
    marketable equity securities, which are recorded in equity
    investment income, are determined using the specific
    identification method.

Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are
    recorded in other assets. Impairment testing is based on
    applicable accounting guidance and the cost basis is reduced
    when impairment is deemed to be
     other-than-temporary. 

Certain equity investments held by Global Principal Investments,
    the Corporation s diversified equity investor in private
    equity, real estate and other alternative investments, are
    subject to investment company accounting under applicable
    accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value
    with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income.
    These investments are included in other assets. Initially, the
    transaction price of the investment is generally considered to
    be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of
    direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual
    investment using methodologies that include publicly traded
    comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric
    (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation
    multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition
    comparables, entry level multiples and discounted cash flows,
    and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity
    or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in
    fair value include but are not limited to recapitalizations,
    subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or
    debt capital markets. For fund investments, the Corporation
    generally records the fair value of its proportionate interest
    in the fund s capital as reported by the funds 
    respective managers.

Other investments held by Global Principal Investments are
    accounted for under either the equity method or at cost,
    depending on the Corporation s ownership interest, and are
    reported in other assets.

Loans and
    Leases  

Loans measured at historical cost are reported at their
    outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income,
    charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated
    loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums
    or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct
    origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to
    interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned
    income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income
    using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to
    account for certain loans under the fair value option with
    changes in fair value reported in mortgage banking income for
    residential mortgage loans and other income for commercial loans.

The FASB issued new disclosure guidance, effective on a
    prospective basis for the Corporation s 2010 year-end
    reporting, that addresses disclosure of loans and other
    financing receivables and the related allowance. The new
    accounting guidance defines a portfolio segment as the level at
    which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology
    to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of
    financing receivables as the level of disaggregation of
    portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute,
    risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The
    Corporation s portfolio segments are home loans, credit
    card and other consumer, and commercial. The classes within the
    home loans portfolio segment are residential mortgage, home
    equity and discontinued real estate. The classes within the
    credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are
    U.S. credit card,
     non-U.S. credit 
    card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes
    within the commercial portfolio segment are
    U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease
    financing,
     non-U.S. commercial 
    and U.S. small business commercial. Under this new
    accounting guidance, the allowance is presented by portfolio
    segment.

Purchased
    Credit-impaired Loans  

The Corporation purchases loans with and without evidence of
    credit quality deterioration since origination. Evidence of
    credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include
    statistics such as past due status, refreshed borrower credit
    scores and refreshed
     loan-to-value 
    (LTV) ratios, some of which are not immediately available as of
    the purchase date. The Corporation continues to evaluate this
    information and other credit-related information as it becomes
    available. Purchased loans are considered to be impaired if the
    Corporation does not expect to receive all contractually
    required cash flows due to concerns about credit quality. The
    excess of the cash flows expected to be collected measured as of
    the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value is referred
    to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income
    over the remaining life of the loan using a level yield
    methodology. The difference between contractually required
    payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected
    to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.

The initial fair values for PCI loans are determined by
    discounting both principal and interest cash flows expected to
    be collected using an observable discount rate for similar
    instruments with adjustments that management believes a market
    participant would consider in determining fair value. The
    Corporation estimates the cash flows expected to be collected
    upon acquisition using internal credit risk, interest rate and
    prepayment risk models that incorporate management s best
    estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss
    severity and payment speeds.

Subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows result in
    a charge to provision for credit losses and a corresponding
    increase to a valuation allowance included in the allowance for
    loan and lease losses. Subsequent increases in expected
    principal cash flows result in a recovery of any previously
    recorded allowance for loan and lease losses, to the extent
    applicable, and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference
    to accretable yield for any remaining increase. Changes in
    expected interest cash flows may result in reclassifications
    to/from the nonaccretable difference. Loan disposals, which may
    include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full from the
    borrower or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the
    PCI loan pool at its allocated carrying amount. Beginning on
    January 1, 2010, loans modified in a TDR remain within the
    PCI loan pools. Prior to January 1, 2010, TDRs were removed
    from the PCI loan pools.

Leases  

The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers
    through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases
    are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus
    estimated residual value of the

Bank of America
    2010        145  

Table of Contents   

leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which
    are a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse
    debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases
    is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using
    methods that approximate the interest method.

Allowance for
    Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance
    for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
    commitments, represents management s estimate of probable
    losses inherent in the Corporation s lending activities.
    The allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for
    unfunded lending commitments exclude amounts for loans and
    unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value
    option as the fair values of these instruments reflect a credit
    component. The allowance for loan and lease losses does not
    include amounts related to accrued interest receivable other
    than billed interest and fees on credit card receivables as
    accrued interest receivable is reversed when a loan is placed on
    nonaccrual status. The allowance for loan and lease losses
    represents the estimated probable credit losses in funded
    consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for
    unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of
    credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents
    estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit
    instruments based on utilization assumptions. Credit exposures
    deemed to be uncollectible, excluding derivative assets, trading
    account assets and loans carried at fair value, are charged
    against these accounts. Cash recovered on previously charged off
    amounts is recorded as a recovery to these accounts. Management
    evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease
    losses based on the combined total of these two components.

The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed
    reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and
    to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The
    allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which
    generally consist of consumer real estate within the home loans
    portfolio segment and credit card loans within the credit card
    and other consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated
    portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss
    forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical
    loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on
    portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic
    conditions and credit scores.

The Corporation s home loans portfolio segment is comprised
    primarily of large groups of homogeneous consumer loans secured
    by residential real estate. The amount of losses incurred in the
    homogeneous loan pools is estimated based upon how many of the
    loans will default and the loss in the event of default. Using
    statistically valid modeling methodologies, the Corporation
    estimates how many of the homogeneous loans will default based
    on the individual loans  attributes aggregated into pools
    of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes
    that are most significant to the probability of default and are
    used to estimate default include refreshed LTV or in the case of
    a subordinated lien, refreshed combined
     loan-to-value 
    (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e.,
    vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by
    present collection status (whether the loan is current,
    delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). This estimate is based
    on the Corporation s historical experience with the loan
    portfolio. The estimate is adjusted to reflect an assessment of
    environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data
    underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate
    values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and
    the regulatory environment. The probability of default of a loan
    is based on an analysis of the movement of loans with the
    measured attributes from either current or each of the
    delinquency categories to default over a twelve-month period.
    Loans 90 or more days past due or those expected to migrate to
    90 or more days past due within the twelve-month period are
    assigned a rate of

default that measures the percentage of such loans that will
    default over their lives given the assumption that the condition
    causing the ultimate default presently exists as of the
    measurement date. On home equity loans where the Corporation
    holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the
    best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at
    100 percent.

The allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card
    and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates
    delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered
    when assessing loss rates include: the value of the underlying
    collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the
    obligor s liquidity and other financial indicators along
    with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are
    updated regularly for changes in economic and business
    conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial
    loan portfolios are reserves which are maintained to cover
    uncertainties that affect the Corporation s estimate of
    probable losses including domestic and global economic
    uncertainty and large single name defaults.

The remaining commercial portfolios, including nonperforming
    commercial loans, as well as consumer real estate loans modified
    in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small
    business loans are reviewed in accordance with applicable
    accounting guidance on impaired loans and TDRs. If necessary, a
    specific allowance is established for these loans if they are
    deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based
    on current information and events, it is probable that the
    Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due, including
    principal
     and/or 
    interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement,
    and once a loan has been identified as impaired, management
    measures impairment. Impaired loans and TDRs are primarily
    measured based on the present value of payments expected to be
    received, discounted at the loans  original effective
    contractual interest rates, or discounted at the portfolio
    average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding
    renegotiated and promotionally priced loans for the renegotiated
    TDR portfolio. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be measured
    based on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely
    dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair
    value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. If the
    recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds this amount, a
    specific allowance is established as a component of the
    allowance for loan and lease losses unless these are consumer
    real estate loans that are solely dependent on the collateral
    for repayment, in which case the initial amount that exceeds the
    fair value of the collateral is charged off.

Generally, prior to performing a detailed property valuation
    including a walk-through of a property, the Corporation
    initially estimates the fair value of the collateral securing
    consumer loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for
    repayment using an automated valuation method (AVM). An AVM is a
    tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to
    market data including sales of comparable properties and price
    trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which
    the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM
    value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized
    indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations,
    the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to
    estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is
    inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation
    believes that they are representative of the portfolio in the
    aggregate.

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the
    Corporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded
    lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial
    guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The reserve
    for unfunded lending commitments excludes commitments accounted
    for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments
    are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and
    segregated by risk according to the Corporation s internal
    risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction
    with an analysis of historical loss experience, utilization
    assumptions, current economic conditions, performance

146        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

trends within the portfolio and any other pertinent information,
    result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending
    commitments.

The allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease
    portfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is
    reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses
    and other liabilities. Provision for credit losses related to
    the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is
    reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Nonperforming
    Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies  

Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and
    leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status including
    nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured
    in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing
    financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value
    option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming
    loans and leases.

In accordance with the Corporation s policies, non-bankrupt
    credit card loans and unsecured consumer loans are charged off
    no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes
    180 days past due. The outstanding balance of real
    estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property
    value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged off no later
    than the end of the month in which the account becomes
    180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured
    by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The estimated
    property value, less estimated costs to sell, is determined
    using the same process as described for impaired loans in the
    Allowance for Credit Losses section beginning on page 146.
    Personal property-secured loans are charged off no later than
    the end of the month in which the account becomes 120 days
    past due. Unsecured accounts in bankruptcy, including credit
    cards, are charged off 60 days after bankruptcy
    notification. For secured products, accounts in bankruptcy are
    written down to the collateral value, less cost to sell, by the
    end of the month in which the account becomes 60 days past
    due. Consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by
    personal property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed on
    nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and therefore are not
    reported as nonperforming loans. Real estate-secured loans are
    generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as
    nonperforming at 90 days past due. However, consumer loans
    secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the FHA
    are not placed on nonaccrual status, and therefore, are not
    reported as nonperforming loans. Accrued interest receivable is
    reversed when a consumer loan is placed on nonaccrual status.
    Interest collections on nonaccruing consumer loans for which the
    ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as
    principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited
    to interest income when received. These loans may be restored to
    accrual status when all principal and interest is current and
    full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and
    interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes
    well-secured and is in the process of collection. Consumer loans
    whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are
    current at the time of restructuring remain on accrual status if
    there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and
    payment in full under the restructured terms is expected.
    Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and
    reported as nonperforming until there is sustained repayment
    performance for a reasonable period, generally six months.
    Consumer TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as
    performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which
    the restructuring occurred or the year in which the loans are
    returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing consumer
    TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of
    modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout
    the remaining lives of the loans.

Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that
    are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest,
    or where reasonable

doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are
    individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed
    on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless
    well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial loans
    and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR
    are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming
    until the loans have performed for an adequate period of time
    under the restructured agreement, generally six months. Accruing
    commercial TDRs are reported as performing TDRs through the end
    of the calendar year in which the loans are returned to accrual
    status. In addition, if accruing commercial TDRs bear less than
    a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are
    reported as performing TDRs throughout the remaining lives of
    the loans. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when a
    commercial loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest
    collections on nonaccruing commercial loans and leases for which
    the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are
    applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are
    credited to income when received. Commercial loans and leases
    may be restored to accrual status when all principal and
    interest is current and full repayment of the remaining
    contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan
    otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of
    collection. Business card loans are charged off no later than
    the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days
    past due or where 60 days have elapsed since receipt of
    notification of bankruptcy filing, whichever comes first. These
    loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off
    and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other
    commercial loans are generally charged off when all or a portion
    of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.

The entire balance of a consumer and commercial loan is
    contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received
    by the specified due date on the customer s billing
    statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due
    loans until the date the loan goes into nonaccrual status, if
    applicable.

PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.
    Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the
    Corporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as
    the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition
    date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income
    over the remaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net
    charge-offs exclude write-downs on PCI loan pools as the fair
    value already considers the estimated credit losses.

Loans
     Held-for-sale   

Loans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future,
    including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a
    lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and
    other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower
    of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for
    certain LHFS, including first mortgage LHFS, under the fair
    value option. Mortgage loan origination costs related to LHFS
    which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option
    are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Mortgage
    loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or
    fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
    loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income
    upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status
    and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy
    above, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and
    leases.

Premises and
    Equipment  

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
    recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to
    40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture
    and

equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful
    life for leasehold improvements.

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights  

The Corporation accounts for consumer-related MSRs at fair value
    with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income,
    while commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs
    are accounted for using the amortization method (i.e., lower of
    cost or market) with impairment recognized as a reduction in
    mortgage banking income. To reduce the volatility of earnings
    related to interest rate and market value fluctuations, certain
    securities and derivatives such as options and interest rate
    swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not
    designated as accounting hedges. These economic hedges are
    carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
    mortgage banking income.

The Corporation estimates the fair value of the consumer-related
    MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value
    of estimated future net servicing income. This is accomplished
    through an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach that
    factors in prepayment risk. This approach consists of projecting
    servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and
    discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.
    The key economic assumptions used in valuations of MSRs include
    weighted-average lives of the MSRs and the OAS levels. The OAS
    represents the spread that is added to the discount rate so that
    the sum of the discounted cash flows equals the market price,
    therefore it is a measure of the extra yield over the reference
    discount factor (i.e., the forward swap curve) that the
    Corporation expects to earn by holding the asset. These
    variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter
    as market conditions and projected interest rates change, and
    could have an adverse impact on the value of the MSRs and could
    result in a corresponding reduction in mortgage banking income.

Goodwill and
    Intangible Assets  

Goodwill is calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting
    for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not
    amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual
    basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential
    impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit, as
    defined under applicable accounting guidance, is a business
    segment or one level below a business segment. The goodwill
    impairment analysis is a two-step test. The first step of the
    goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of
    each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill.
    If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
    amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not
    impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to
    measure potential impairment.

The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of
    goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step
    indicated possible impairment. The implied fair value of
    goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
    goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the
    excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in
    the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the assets,
    liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting
    unit was being acquired in a business combination. Measurement
    of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting
    unit is consistent with the requirements of the fair value
    measurements accounting guidance, which defines fair value as an
    exit price, meaning the price that would be received to sell an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. The
    adjustments to measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles
    at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair
    value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the implied fair value of
    goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit,
    there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting
    unit

exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge
    is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot
    exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An
    impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and
    subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not
    permitted under applicable accounting guidance.

For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment
    loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible
    asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying
    amount of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if
    it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
    result from the use of the asset.

Variable Interest
    Entities  

A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity
    investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the
    entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the
    primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. Prior to
    January 1, 2010, the primary beneficiary was the entity
    that would absorb a majority of the economic risks and rewards
    of the VIE based on an analysis of projected
    probability-weighted cash flows. In accordance with the new
    accounting guidance on consolidation of VIEs and transfers of
    financial assets effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation
    is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct
    the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
    VIE s economic performance and an obligation to absorb
    losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation
    reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in
    and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly
    reassessment process considers whether the Corporation has
    acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the
    VIE through changes in governing documents or other
    circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether the
    Corporation has acquired or disposed of a financial interest
    that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in
    the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The
    consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is
    involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes
    in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets
    and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded
    at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon
    deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of
    deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value
    of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.

The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization
    activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or
    debt securities into a trust or other vehicle such that the
    assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the
    Corporation. Assets held in a trust can only be used to settle
    obligations of the trust. The creditors of these trusts
    typically have no recourse to the Corporation except in
    accordance with the Corporation s obligations under
    standard representations and warranties. Prior to 2010,
    securitization trusts typically met the definition of a QSPE and
    as such were not subject to consolidation.

When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a
    securitization trust, including non-agency residential
    mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, automobile loans and
    student loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most
    significant activities of the trust. The Corporation does not
    have the power to direct the most significant activities of a
    residential mortgage agency trust unless the Corporation holds
    substantially all of the issued securities and has the
    unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the
    most significant activities of a commercial mortgage
    securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer
    or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which
    embody certain controlling rights. In accordance with the new
    accounting guidance, the Corporation consolidates a whole loan
    securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most
    significant activities and also holds securities issued by the
    trust or has other contractual

148        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

arrangements, other than standard representations and
    warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.

The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and
    AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts.
    The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or
    resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing
    activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the
    trust s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities,
    sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the
    identification of securities to be transferred in and the
    structure of securities to be issued, and also retains
    securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could
    potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does
    not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if
    one or a limited number of third-party investors share
    responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over
    the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or
    other substantive rights.

Other VIEs used by the Corporation include commercial paper
    conduits, CDOs, investment vehicles created on behalf of
    customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation
    consolidated all previously unconsolidated commercial paper
    conduits in accordance with the new accounting guidance on
    January 1, 2010. In its role as administrator, the
    Corporation has the power to determine which assets are held in
    the conduits and the Corporation manages the issuance of
    commercial paper. Through liquidity facilities, loss protection
    commitments and other arrangements, the Corporation has an
    obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE.

The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager
    for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to
    direct the activities that most significantly impact the
    economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of
    default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior
    securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage the
    assets of the CDO, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.

The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment
    vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle
    or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs
    potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in
    the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The
    Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a
    single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or
    manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does
    not have a variable interest that could potentially be
    significant to the vehicle.

Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded
    at fair value. Prior to 2010, retained interests were initially
    recorded at an allocated cost basis in proportion to the
    relative fair values of the assets sold and interests retained.
    In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities
    issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Quoted market prices are
    primarily used to obtain fair values of these debt securities,
    which are AFS debt securities or trading account assets.
    Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests
    are not available, therefore, the Corporation estimates fair
    values based on the present value of the associated expected
    future cash flows. This may require management to estimate
    credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward interest yield curves,
    discount rates and other factors that impact the value of
    retained interests. Retained residual interests in
    unconsolidated securitization trusts are classified in trading
    account assets or other assets with changes in fair value
    recorded in income. The Corporation may also enter into
    derivatives with unconsolidated VIEs, which are carried at fair
    value with changes in fair value recorded in income.

Fair
    Value  

The Corporation measures the fair values of its financial
    instruments in accordance with accounting guidance that requires
    an entity to base fair value on exit price and maximize the use
    of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    to determine the exit price. The Corporation categorizes its
    financial instruments, based on the priority of inputs to the
    valuation technique, into a three-level hierarchy, as described
    below. Trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets
    and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, MSRs
    and certain other assets are carried at fair value in accordance
    with applicable accounting guidance. The Corporation has also
    elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the
    fair value option, including certain corporate loans and loan
    commitments, LHFS, commercial paper and other short-term
    borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed
    secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt. The
    following describes the three-level hierarchy.

Level 1   
 
         Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt
    and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded
    in an active exchange market, as well as certain
    U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are
    actively traded in
     over-the-counter 
    markets.

Level 2   
 
         Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
    markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with
    quoted prices that are traded less frequently than
    exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where value
    is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are
    observable in the market or can be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. This category generally
    includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed debt
    securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts,
    residential mortgage loans and certain LHFS.

Level 3   
 
         Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of
    the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities
    include financial instruments for which the determination of
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is
    generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
    methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the
    assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset
    or liability. This category generally includes certain private
    equity investments and other principal investments, retained
    residual interests in securitizations, residential MSRs,
    asset-backed securities (ABS), highly structured, complex or
    long-dated derivative contracts, certain LHFS, IRLCs and certain
    CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained
    for a significant portion of the underlying assets.

Income
    Taxes  

There are two components of income tax expense: current and
    deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be
    paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax
    expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and
    liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected
    to be paid in the future because of future reversals of
    temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as
    measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the
    financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
    for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and
    tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to
    reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes
    are more-likely-than-not to be realized.

Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a
    two-step model: 1) a tax position must be
    more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its
    technical merits in order to be recognized, and 2) the
    benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that
    position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon
    settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and
    the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an
    unrecognized tax benefit (UTB). The Corporation records income
    tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income
    tax expense.

Retirement
    Benefits  

The Corporation has established retirement plans covering
    substantially all full-time and certain part-time employees.
    Pension expense under these plans is charged to current
    operations and consists of several components of net pension
    cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future
    experience under the plans.

In addition, the Corporation has established unfunded
    supplemental benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement
    plans (SERPs) for selected officers of the Corporation and its
    subsidiaries that provide benefits that cannot be paid from a
    qualified retirement plan due to Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions. The Corporation s current executive officers
    do not earn additional retirement income under SERPs. These
    plans are nonqualified under the Internal Revenue Code and
    assets used to fund benefit payments are not segregated from
    other assets of the Corporation; therefore, in general, a
    participant s or beneficiary s claim to benefits under
    these plans is as a general creditor. In addition, the
    Corporation has established several postretirement healthcare
    and life insurance benefit plans.

Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income  

The Corporation records unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt
    and marketable equity securities, gains and losses on cash flow
    accounting hedges, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses,
    transition obligation and prior service costs on pension and
    postretirement plans, foreign currency translation adjustments
    and related hedges of net investments in foreign operations in
    accumulated OCI,
     net-of-tax. 
    Unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and marketable equity
    securities are reclassified to earnings as the gains or losses
    are realized upon sale of the securities. Unrealized losses on
    AFS securities deemed to represent OTTI are reclassified to
    earnings at the time of the impairment charge. Beginning in
    2009, for AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not
    intend to sell or it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be
    required to sell, only the credit component of an unrealized
    loss is reclassified to earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives
    accounted for as cash flow hedges are reclassified to earnings
    when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Translation gains
    or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments are
    reclassified to earnings upon the substantial sale or
    liquidation of investments in foreign operations.

Earnings Per
    Common Share  

Earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income
    (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average
    common shares outstanding. Net income (loss) allocated to common
    shareholders represents net income (loss) applicable to common
    shareholders which is net income (loss) adjusted for preferred
    stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of
    discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion
    when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends
    related to the current dividend period that have not been
    declared as of period end, less income allocated to
    participating securities (see below for additional information).
    Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing
    income (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the
    weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts
    representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, outstanding warrants
    and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible
    preferred stock, if applicable.

On January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted new accounting
    guidance on earnings per share that defines unvested share-based
    payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends
    as participating securities that are included in computing EPS
    using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings
    allocation formula under which EPS is calculated for common
    stock and participating securities according to dividends
    declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings.
    Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed,
    are allocated to participating securities and common shares
    based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

In an exchange of non-convertible preferred stock, income
    allocated to common shareholders is adjusted for the difference
    between the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair
    value of the common stock exchanged. In an induced conversion of
    convertible preferred stock, income allocated to common
    shareholders is reduced by the excess of the fair value of the
    common stock exchanged over the fair value of the common stock
    that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.

Foreign Currency
    Translation  

Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and
    subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of
    each entity. For certain of the foreign operations, the
    functional currency is the local currency, in which case the
    assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for
    consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the
    U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for
    assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for
    results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains or losses
    as well as gains and losses from certain hedges, are reported as
    a component of accumulated OCI on an after-tax basis. When the
    foreign entity s functional currency is determined to be
    the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement currency gains
    or losses on foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities
    are included in earnings.

Credit Card and
    Deposit Arrangements  

Endorsing
    Organization Agreements  

The Corporation contracts with other organizations to obtain
    their endorsement of the Corporation s loan and deposit
    products. This endorsement may provide to the Corporation
    exclusive rights to market to the organization s members or
    to customers on behalf of the Corporation. These organizations
    endorse the Corporation s loan and deposit products and
    provide the Corporation with their mailing lists and marketing
    activities. These agreements generally have terms that range
    from two to five years. The Corporation typically pays royalties
    in exchange for the endorsement. Compensation costs related to
    the credit card agreements are recorded as contra-revenue in
    card income.

Cardholder Reward
    Agreements  

The Corporation offers reward programs that allow its
    cardholders to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad
    range of rewards including cash, travel and discounted products.
    The Corporation establishes a rewards liability based upon the
    points earned that are expected to be redeemed and the average
    cost per point redeemed. The points to be redeemed are estimated
    based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account
    transaction activity and other historical card performance. The
    liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The estimated
    cost of the rewards programs is recorded as contra-revenue in
    card income.

Insurance Income
    and Insurance Expense  

Property and casualty and credit life and disability premiums
    are generally recognized over the term of the policies on a
    pro-rata basis for all policies except for certain of the
    lender-placed auto insurance and the guaranteed auto protection
    (GAP) policies. For lender-placed auto insurance, premiums are
    recognized when collections become probable due to high
    cancellation rates experienced early in the life of the policy.
    For GAP insurance, revenue recognition is correlated to the
    exposure and accelerated over the life of the contract. Mortgage
    reinsurance premiums are recognized as earned. Insurance expense
    includes insurance claims, commissions and premium taxes, all of
    which are recorded in other general operating expense.

NOTE 2  Merger
    and Restructuring Activity   

Merrill
    Lynch  

On January 1, 2009, the Corporation acquired Merrill Lynch
    through its merger with a subsidiary of the Corporation in
    exchange for common and preferred stock with a value of
    $29.1 billion. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
    Merrill Lynch common shareholders received 0.8595 of a share of
    Bank of America Corporation common stock in exchange for each
    share of Merrill Lynch common stock. In addition, Merrill Lynch
    non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America
    Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical
    terms. On October 15, 2010, the outstanding Merrill Lynch
    convertible preferred stock automatically converted into Bank of
    America Corporation common stock in accordance with its terms.

The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and
    liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the Merrill
    Lynch acquisition date as summarized in the table below.
    Goodwill of $5.2 billion was calculated as the purchase
    premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets
    acquired. No goodwill is deductible for federal income tax
    purposes. The goodwill was allocated principally to the
     Global Wealth   Investment Management  ( GWIM)
     and  Global Banking   Markets (GBAM)
     business segments.

Condensed
    Statement of Net Assets Acquired  

The following condensed statement of net assets acquired
    reflects the values assigned to Merrill Lynch s net assets
    as of the acquisition date.

Contingencies  

The fair value of net assets acquired includes certain
    contingent liabilities that were recorded as of the acquisition
    date. Merrill Lynch has been named as a defendant in various
    pending legal actions and proceedings arising in connection with
    its activities as a global diversified financial services
    institution. Some of these legal actions and proceedings include
    claims for substantial compensatory
     and/or 
    punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
    Merrill Lynch is also involved in investigations
     and/or 
    proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. Due to
    the number of variables and assumptions involved in assessing
    the possible outcome of these legal actions, sufficient
    information did not exist as of the acquisition date to
    reasonably estimate the fair value of these contingent
    liabilities. As such, these contingences have been measured in
    accordance with applicable accounting guidance which states that
    a loss is recognized when it is probable of occurring and the
    loss amount can be reasonably estimated. For further
    information, see  Note 14   Commitments
    and Contingencies. 

Merger and
    Restructuring Charges and Reserves  

Merger and restructuring charges are recorded in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income and include incremental costs
    to integrate the operations of the Corporation and its recent
    acquisitions. These charges represent costs associated with
    these one-time activities and do not represent ongoing costs of
    the fully integrated combined organization. On January 1,
    2009, the Corporation adopted new accounting guidance on
    business combinations, on a prospective basis, that requires
    that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be
    charged to expense as incurred. Previously, these expenses were
    recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

The table below presents severance and employee-related charges,
    systems integrations and related charges, and other
    merger-related charges.

Included for 2010 are merger-related charges of
    $1.6 billion related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and
    $202 million related to the July 1, 2008 acquisition
    of Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide). Included for
    2009 are merger-related charges of $1.8 billion related to
    the Merrill Lynch acquisition, $843 million related to the
    Countrywide acquisition and $97 million related to earlier
    acquisitions. Included for 2008 are merger-related charges of
    $205 million related to the Countrywide acquisition and
    $730 million related to earlier acquisitions.

During 2010, $1.6 billion in merger-related charges for the
    Merrill Lynch acquisition included $426 million for
    severance and other employee-related costs, $975 million
    for systems integration costs and $217 million in other
    merger-related costs. In 2009, the $1.8 billion in
    merger-related charges for the Merrill Lynch acquisition
    included $1.2 billion for severance and other
    employee-related costs, $480 million for systems
    integration costs and $129 million in other merger-related
    costs.

The table below presents the changes in exit cost and
    restructuring reserves for 2010 and 2009. Exit cost reserves
    were established in purchase accounting resulting in an increase
    in goodwill. Restructuring reserves are established by a charge
    to merger and restructuring charges, and the restructuring
    charges are included in the total merger and restructuring
    charges in the table above. Exit costs were not recorded in
    purchase accounting for the Merrill Lynch acquisition in
    accordance with new accounting guidance on business combinations
    which was effective January 1, 2009.

n/a = not applicable

At December 31, 2009, there were $403 million of
    restructuring reserves related to the Merrill Lynch and
    Countrywide acquisitions for severance and other
    employee-related costs. During 2010, $429 million was added
    to the restructuring reserves related to severance and other
    employee-related costs primarily associated with the Merrill
    Lynch acquisition. Cash payments and other of $496 million
    during 2010 were related to severance and other employee-related
    costs primarily associated with the Merrill Lynch acquisition.
    Payments associated with the Countrywide acquisition are
    expected to continue into 2011, while Merrill Lynch related
    payments are anticipated to continue into 2012. At
    December 31, 2010, restructuring reserves of
    $336 million related principally to Merrill Lynch.

    exposures. For additional information on the Corporation s
    derivatives and hedging activities, see
     Note 1   Summary of Significant  

Accounting Principles . The table below identifies

ALM and Risk
    Management Derivatives  

The Corporation s ALM and risk management activities
    include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the
    Corporation including both derivatives that are designated as
    hedging instruments and economic hedges. Interest rate,
    commodity, credit and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in
    the Corporation s ALM and risk management activities.

The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk
    management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate
    contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest
    rate and basis swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to
    minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by
    interest rate volatility. The Corporation s goal is to
    manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest
    rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings. As a
    result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets
    and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or
    losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the
    hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to
    substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or
    depreciation.

Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage
    business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets
    or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market
    conditions such as interest rate movements. To hedge interest
    rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation
    utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative
    instruments including purchased options. The Corporation also
    utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest
    rate swaps, forward

settlement contracts and euro-dollar futures as economic hedges
    of the fair value of MSRs. For additional information on MSRs,
    see  Note 25   Mortgage Servicing
    Rights .

The Corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the
    foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign
    currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the
    Corporation s investments in
     non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
    Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward
    contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one
    country for the currency of another country at an
     agreed-upon 
    price on an
     agreed-upon 
    settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will
    increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency
    exchange and interest rates fluctuate.

The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such
    as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as
    non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk
    management services to customers or to manage price risk
    associated with its physical and financial commodity positions.
    The non-derivative commodity contracts and physical inventories
    of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility.
    Cash flow and fair value accounting hedges provide a method to
    mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.

The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit
    risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures.
    Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, total return
    swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are

154        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

accounted for as economic hedges and changes in fair value are
    recorded in other income (loss).

Derivatives
    Designated as Accounting Hedges  

The Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity
    and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against
    changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to
    fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity
    prices (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these

types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against
    changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and
    other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The
    Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated
     non-U.S. operations 
    determined to have functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts,
    cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign
    currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).

Cash Flow
    Hedges  

The table below summarizes certain information related to the
    Corporation s derivatives designated as cash flow hedges
    and net investment hedges for 2010, 2009 and 2008. During the
    next 12 months, net losses in accumulated OCI of
    approximately $1.8 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) on
    derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are
    expected to be reclassified into earnings. These net losses
    reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net
    interest income related to the respective hedged items.

Amounts related to interest rate risk on variable rate
    portfolios reclassified from accumulated OCI increased interest
    income on assets by $144 million in 2010, reduced interest
    income on assets by $189 million and $156 million in
    2009 and 2008 and increased interest expense on liabilities by
    $554 million, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts reclassified from
    accumulated OCI exclude amounts related to derivative interest
    accruals which increased interest expense by $88 million
    and increased interest income by $160 million for 2010 and

2009, and increased interest expense by $73 million for
    2008. Hedge ineffectiveness of $(14) million,
    $73 million and $(11) million was recorded in interest
    income, and $(16) million, $(2) million and
    $4 million was recorded in interest expense in 2010, 2009
    and 2008.

Amounts related to commodity price risk reclassified from
    accumulated OCI are recorded in trading account profits (losses)
    with the underlying hedged item. Amounts related to price risk
    on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are
    recorded in personnel expense. Amounts related to price risk on
    equity investments included in AFS securities reclassified from
    accumulated OCI are recorded in equity investment income with
    the underlying hedged item.

Amounts related to foreign exchange risk recognized in
    accumulated OCI on derivatives exclude gains of
    $192 million related to long-term debt designated as a net
    investment hedge for 2010 compared to losses of
    $387 million for 2009 and $0 for 2008.

Table of Contents   

The Corporation entered into equity total return swaps to hedge
    a portion of cash-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) granted
    to certain employees in February 2010 as part of their 2009
    compensation. These cash-settled RSUs are accrued as liabilities
    over the vesting period and adjusted to fair value based on
    changes in the share price of the Corporation s common
    stock. From time to time, the Corporation may enter into equity
    derivatives to minimize the change in the expense to the
    Corporation driven by fluctuations in the share price of the
    Corporation s common stock during the vesting period of any
    RSUs that may be granted from time to time, if any, subject to
    similar or other terms and conditions. Certain of these
    derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of unrecognized
    non-vested awards with the changes in fair value of the hedge
    recorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in
    the

same period as the RSUs affect earnings. The remaining
    derivatives are accounted for as economic hedges and changes in
    fair value are recorded in personnel expense. For more
    information on restricted stock units and related hedges, see
     Note 20   Stock-Based Compensation Plans. 

Economic
    Hedges  

Derivatives designated as economic hedges, because either they
    did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges,
    are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures.
    The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for
    2010, 2009 and 2008. These gains (losses) are largely offset by
    the income or expense that is recorded on the economically
    hedged item.

Sales and Trading
    Revenue  

The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate
    client transactions, for principal trading purposes, and to
    manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and
    liabilities. It is the Corporation s policy to include
    these derivative instruments in its trading activities which
    include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The
    resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio
    basis as part of the Corporation s  GBAM  business
    segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within
     GBAM  is

recorded on various income statement line items including
    trading account profits (losses) and net interest income as well
    as other revenue categories. However, the vast majority of
    income related to derivative instruments is recorded in trading
    account profits (losses). The table below identifies the amounts
    in the respective income statement line items attributable to
    the Corporation s sales and trading revenue categorized by
    primary risk for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Credit
    Derivatives  

The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to
    facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk
    exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an
    underlying third party-referenced obligation or a portfolio of
    referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation as
    the seller of credit protection to make payments to a buyer upon
    the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events
    generally include bankruptcy of the

referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the
    obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment
    repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a
    portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the
    Corporation may not be required to make payment until a
    specified amount of loss has occurred
     and/or  may
    only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.

Credit derivative instruments in which the Corporation is the
    seller of credit protection and their expiration at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below. These
    instruments are classified as investment and non-

investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying
    reference obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of
    BBB-or higher as investment-grade. Non-investment grade includes
    non-rated credit derivative instruments.

Maximum payout/notional for
    credit-related notes is the same as these amounts.

Bank of America
    2010        159  

Table of Contents   

The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the
    Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the
    Corporation does not solely monitor its exposure to credit
    derivatives based on notional amount because this measure does
    not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As
    such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the
    Corporation s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk
    framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits
    to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur
    within acceptable, predefined limits.

The Corporation economically hedges its market risk exposure to
    credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting
    derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in
    certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit
    protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset
    its exposure. The carrying amount and notional amount of written
    credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased
    credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names
    and terms at December 31, 2010 was $43.7 billion and
    $1.4 trillion compared to $79.4 billion and $2.3 trillion
    at December 31, 2009.

Credit-related notes in the table on page 159 include
    investments in securities issued by CDOs, CLOs and credit-linked
    note vehicles. These instruments are classified as trading
    securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the
    Corporation s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is
    not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the
    terms of the securities owned. The Corporation discloses
    internal categorizations (i.e., investment-grade, non-investment
    grade) consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.

Credit Risk
    Management of Derivatives and
     Credit-related 
    Contingent Features  

The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative
    contracts in the
     over-the-counter 
    market with large, international financial institutions,
    including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety
    of non-financial companies. Substantially all of the derivative
    transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore,
    events such as a credit ratings downgrade (depending on the
    ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would
    typically require an increase in the amount of collateral
    required of the counterparty, where applicable,
     and/or  allow
    the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as
    early termination of all trades. Further, as previously
    described on page 153, the Corporation enters into legally
    enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by
    permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the
    same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.

Substantially all of the Corporation s derivative contracts
    contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in
    the form of International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
    Inc. (ISDA) master agreements that enhance the creditworthiness
    of these instruments compared to other obligations of the

respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted
    (e.g., other debt or equity). These contingent features may be
    for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties
    with respect to changes in the Corporation s
    creditworthiness. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Corporation held cash and securities collateral of
    $76.0 billion and $67.7 billion, and posted cash and
    securities collateral of $61.2 billion and
    $62.2 billion in the normal course of business under
    derivative agreements.

In connection with certain
     over-the-counter 
    derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the
    Corporation could be required to provide additional collateral
    or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the
    event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of Bank of
    America Corporation and its subsidiaries. The amount of
    additional collateral required depends on the contract and is
    usually a fixed incremental amount
     and/or  the
    market value of the exposure. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the amount of additional collateral and termination
    payments that would have been required for such derivatives and
    trading agreements was approximately $1.2 billion and
    $2.1 billion if the long-term credit rating of the
    Corporation was incrementally downgraded by one level by all
    ratings agencies. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a second
    incremental one level downgrade by the ratings agencies would
    have required approximately $1.1 billion and
    $1.2 billion in additional collateral and termination
    payments.

The Corporation records counterparty credit risk valuation
    adjustments on derivative assets in order to properly reflect
    the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are
    necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully
    reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative
    assets. The Corporation considers collateral and legally
    enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its credit
    exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty
    credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these
    counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments can be reversed
    or otherwise adjusted in future periods due to changes in the
    value of the derivative contract, collateral and
    creditworthiness of the counterparty. During 2010 and 2009,
    credit valuation gains (losses) of $731 million and
    $3.1 billion ($(8) million and $1.7 billion, net
    of hedges) for counterparty credit risk related to derivative
    assets were recognized in trading account profits (losses). At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the cumulative counterparty
    credit risk valuation adjustment reduced the derivative assets
    balance by $6.8 billion and $7.9 billion.

In addition, the fair value of the Corporation s or its
    subsidiaries  derivative liabilities is adjusted to reflect
    the impact of the Corporation s credit quality. During 2010
    and 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) of $331 million
    and $(662) million ($262 million and
    $(662) million, net of hedges) were recognized in trading
    account profits (losses) for changes in the Corporation s
    or its subsidiaries  credit risk. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Corporation s cumulative credit risk
    valuation adjustment reduced the derivative liabilities balance
    by $1.1 billion and $732 million.

NOTE 5  Securities   

The table below presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized
    gains and losses in accumulated OCI, and fair value of AFS debt
    and marketable equity securities at December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

(1)   

At December 31, 2010, includes
    approximately 90 percent prime bonds, eight percent Alt-A
    bonds and two percent subprime bonds. At December 31, 2009,
    includes approximately 85 percent prime bonds,
    10 percent Alt-A bonds and five percent subprime bonds.

(2)   

Classified in other assets on the
    Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

At December 31, 2010, the accumulated net unrealized gains
    on AFS debt securities included in accumulated OCI were
    $714 million, net of the related income tax expense of
    $415 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Corporation had nonperforming AFS debt securities of
    $44 million and $467 million.

At December 31, 2010, both the amortized cost and fair
    value of HTM debt securities were $427 million. At
    December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of HTM
    debt securities were $9.8 billion and $9.7 billion,
    which included ABS that were issued by the Corporation s
    credit card securitization trust and retained by the Corporation
    with an amortized cost of $6.6 billion

and a fair value of $6.4 billion. As a result of the
    adoption of new consolidation guidance, the Corporation
    consolidated the credit card securitization trusts on
    January 1, 2010 and the ABS were eliminated in
    consolidation and the related consumer credit card loans were
    included in loans and leases on the Corporation s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, during the three
    months ended June 30, 2010, $2.9 billion of debt
    securities held in consolidated commercial paper conduits was
    reclassified from HTM to AFS as a result of new regulatory
    capital requirements related to asset-backed commercial paper
    conduits.

The Corporation recorded OTTI losses on AFS debt securities as
    presented in the table below in 2010 and 2009. Upon initial
    impairment of a security, total OTTI losses represent the excess
    of the amortized cost over the fair value. For subsequent
    impairments of the same security, total OTTI losses represent
    additional declines in fair value subsequent to the previously
    recorded OTTI loss(es), if applicable. Unrealized OTTI losses
    recognized in accumulated OCI represent the non-credit component
    of OTTI losses on AFS

debt securities. Net impairment losses recognized in earnings
    represent the credit component of OTTI losses on AFS debt
    securities. In 2010, for certain securities, the Corporation
    recognized credit losses in excess of unrealized losses in
    accumulated OCI. In these instances, a portion of the credit
    losses recognized in earnings has been offset by an unrealized
    gain. Balances in the table exclude $51 million and
    $582 million of gross gains recorded in accumulated OCI
    related to these securities for 2010 and 2009.

The table below presents activity for 2010 and 2009 related to
    the credit component recognized in earnings on debt securities
    held by the Corporation for which a portion of the OTTI loss
    remains in accumulated OCI. At December 31, 2010, those
    debt securities with OTTI for which a portion of the OTTI loss
    remains in accumulated OCI primarily consisted of non-agency
    residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CDOs.

(1)   

On January 1, 2009, the
    Corporation had securities with $134 million of OTTI
    previously recognized in earnings of which $22 million
    represented the credit component and $112 million
    represented the non-credit component which was reclassified to
    accumulated OCI through a cumulative effect transition
    adjustment.

(2)   

In 2010 and 2009, the Corporation
    recognized $354 million and $2.4 billion of OTTI
    losses on debt securities on which no portion of OTTI loss
    remained in accumulated OCI. OTTI losses related to these
    securities are excluded from these amounts.

The Corporation estimates the portion of loss attributable to
    credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the
    expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal
    credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that
    incorporate management s best estimate of current key
    assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment
    rates. Assumptions

used can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by
    such factors as loan interest rate, geographical location of the
    borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. The
    Corporation then uses a third-party vendor to determine how the
    underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each
    security issued from the structure. Expected principal and
    interest cash flows on an impaired debt security are discounted
    using the book yield of each individual impaired debt security.

Based on the expected cash flows derived from the applicable
    model, the Corporation expects to recover the unrealized losses
    in accumulated OCI on non-agency RMBS. Annual constant
    prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected
    considering collateral characteristics such as LTV,
    creditworthiness of borrowers (FICO) and geographic
    concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type
    was 41 percent for prime bonds, 48 percent for Alt-A
    bonds and 53 percent for subprime bonds. Additionally,
    default rates are projected by considering collateral
    characteristics including, but not limited to LTV, FICO and
    geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by
    collateral type were 38 percent for prime bonds,
    58 percent for Alt-A bonds and 62 percent for subprime
    bonds.

Significant assumptions used in the valuation of non-agency RMBS

The table below presents the current fair value and the
    associated gross unrealized losses on investments in securities
    with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and whether these securities have had gross unrealized losses
    for less than twelve months or for twelve months or longer.

(1)   

Includes
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired AFS debt securities on which a portion of the OTTI loss
    remains in OCI.

(2)   

At December 31, 2010, the
    amortized cost of approximately 8,500 AFS securities exceeded
    their fair value by $4.5 billion. At December 31,
    2009, the amortized cost of approximately 12,000 AFS securities
    exceeded their fair value by $7.3 billion.

The Corporation considers the length of time and extent to which
    the fair value of AFS debt securities has been less than cost to
    conclude that such securities were not
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired. The Corporation also considers other factors such as
    the financial condition of the issuer of the security including
    credit ratings and specific events affecting the operations of
    the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt
    security, and other

industry and macroeconomic conditions. As the Corporation has no
    intent to sell securities with unrealized losses and it is not
    more-likely-than-not that the Corporation will be required to
    sell these securities before recovery of amortized cost, the
    Corporation has concluded that the securities are not impaired
    on an
     other-than-temporary 
    basis.

The components of realized gains and losses on sales of debt
    securities for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented in the table

During 2010, the Corporation entered into a series of
    transactions in its AFS debt securities portfolio that involved
    securitizations as well as sales of non-agency RMBS. These
    transactions were initiated following a review of corporate risk
    objectives in light of proposed Basel regulatory capital changes
    and liquidity targets. During 2010, the carrying value of the
    non-agency RMBS portfolio was reduced $14.5 billion
    primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales and
    securitizations as well as paydowns. The Corporation recognized
    net losses of $922 million on the series of transactions in
    the AFS debt securities portfolio, and improved the overall
    credit quality of the remaining portfolio such that the
    percentage of the non-agency RMBS portfolio that is below
    investment-grade was reduced significantly.

Certain Corporate
    and Strategic Investments  

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation owned
    25.6 billion shares representing approximately 10 and
    11 percent of China Construction Bank (CCB). During 2010,
    the Corporation sold its rights to participate in CCB s
    secondary offering resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    $432 million recorded in equity investment income. During
    2009, the Corporation sold its initial investment of
    19.1 billion common shares in CCB for a pre-tax gain of
    $7.3 billion. During 2010, the Corporation recorded in
    accumulated OCI a $6.7 billion after-tax unrealized gain on
    23.6 billion shares of the Corporation s investment in
    CCB, which previously had been carried at cost. These shares
    were reclassified to AFS during 2010 because the sales
    restrictions on these shares expire within one year (August
    2011), and therefore, in accordance with applicable accounting
    guidance, the Corporation recorded the unrealized gain in
    accumulated OCI, net of a 10 percent restriction discount.
    Sales restrictions on the remaining two billion CCB shares
    continue until August 2013, and these shares continue to be
    carried at cost. At December 31, 2010, the cost basis of
    all remaining CCB shares was $9.2 billion, the carrying
    value was $19.7 billion and the fair value was
    $20.8 billion. At December 31, 2009, both the cost
    basis and the carrying value were $9.2 billion and the fair
    value was $22.0 billion. Dividend income on this investment
    is recorded in equity investment income and during 2010, the
    Corporation recorded dividend income of $535 million from
    CCB. The investment is recorded in other assets. The Corporation
    remains a significant shareholder in CCB and intends to continue
    the important long-term strategic alliance with CCB originally
    entered into in 2005. As part of this alliance, the Corporation
    expects to continue to provide advice and assistance to CCB.

During 2010, the Corporation sold various strategic investments
    which included the Corporation s investment of
    188.4 million preferred shares and 56.5 million common
    shares in Ita  Unibanco Holding S.A. (Ita  Unibanco)
    at a price of $3.9 billion. The Ita  Unibanco
    investment was accounted for at fair value and recorded as AFS
    marketable equity securities in other assets with unrealized
    gains recorded,
     net-of-tax, 
    in accumulated OCI. The cost basis of this investment was
    $2.6 billion and, after transaction costs, the pre-tax gain
    was $1.2 billion which was recorded in equity investment
    income. In addition, the Corporation sold its 24.9 percent
    ownership interest in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A.B. de C.V.
    to an affiliate of its parent company, Banco Santander, S.A.,
    the majority interest holder. The investment was accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting and recorded in other
    assets. This sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of
    $428 million which was recorded in equity investment
    income. The Corporation also sold all of its Class B units
    in

MasterCard Worldwide, Inc. (MasterCard), which were acquired
    primarily upon MasterCard s initial public offering and
    recorded in other assets. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain
    of $440 million which was recorded in equity investment
    income. Also during the year, the Corporation sold its exposure
    of $2.9 billion in certain private equity funds recorded in
    other assets, comprised of $1.5 billion in capital and
    $1.4 billion in unfunded commitments resulting in a loss of
    $163 million which was recorded in equity investment income.

As part of the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Corporation
    acquired an economic ownership in BlackRock Inc. (BlackRock), a
    publicly traded investment company. During 2010, the Corporation
    sold 51.2 million shares consisting of 48.9 million
    preferred and 2.3 million common shares for net proceeds of
    $8.3 billion resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    $91 million, lowering its ownership to 13.6 million
    preferred shares, or 7 percent. The carrying value of this
    investment at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
    $2.2 billion and $10.0 billion and the fair value was
    $2.6 billion and $15.0 billion. Following the sale,
    the Corporation s remaining interest is held at cost due to
    restrictions that affect the marketability of the preferred
    shares. The investment is recorded in other assets. During 2009,
    BlackRock completed its purchase of Barclays Global Investors,
    an asset management business, from Barclays PLC which had the
    effect of diluting the Corporation s ownership interest in
    BlackRock from approximately 50 percent to approximately
    34 percent and, for accounting purposes, was treated as a
    sale of a portion of the Corporation s ownership interest.
    As a result, upon closing of this transaction, the Corporation
    recorded an adjustment to its investment in BlackRock resulting
    in a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion which was recorded in
    equity investment income.

In 2010, a third-party investor in a joint venture in which the
    Corporation held a 46.5 percent ownership interest sold its
    interest to the joint venture, resulting in an increase in the
    Corporation s ownership interest to 49 percent. The
    joint venture was formed in 2009 with First Data Corporation
    (First Data) creating Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.
    Under the terms of the agreement, the Corporation contributed
    its merchant processing business to the joint venture and First
    Data contributed certain merchant processing contracts and
    personnel resources. In 2009, the Corporation recorded in other
    income a pre-tax gain of $3.8 billion related to this
    transaction. The investment in the joint venture, which was
    initially recorded at a fair value of $4.7 billion, is
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting with income
    recorded in equity investment income. The carrying value at both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $4.7 billion.

The Corporation mitigates a portion of its credit risk on the
    residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic
    securitization vehicles. These vehicles issue long-term notes to
    investors, the proceeds of which are held as cash collateral.
    The Corporation pays a premium to the vehicles to purchase
    mezzanine loss protection on a portfolio of residential
    mortgages owned by the Corporation. Cash held in the vehicles is
    used to reimburse the Corporation in the event that losses on
    the mortgage portfolio exceed 10 basis points (bps) of the
    original pool balance, up to the remaining amount of purchased
    loss protection of $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The vehicles are variable
    interest entities from which the Corporation purchases credit
    protection and in which the Corporation does not have a variable
    interest; accordingly, these vehicles are not consolidated by
    the Corporation. Amounts due from the vehicles are recorded in
    other income (loss) when the Corporation recognizes a
    reimbursable loss, as described above. Amounts are collected
    when reimbursable losses are realized through

the sale of the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Corporation had a receivable of $722 million
    and $1.0 billion from these vehicles for reimbursement of
    losses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $53.9 billion
    and $70.7 billion of residential mortgage loans were
    referenced under these agreements. The Corporation records an
    allowance for credit losses on these loans without regard to the
    existence of the purchased loss protection as the protection
    does not represent a guarantee of individual loans.

In addition, the Corporation has entered into long-term standby
    agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling
    $14.3 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, providing full protection on residential mortgage
    loans that become severely delinquent. The Corporation does not
    record an allowance for credit losses on these loans as the
    loans are individually insured.

Nonperforming
    Loans and Leases  

The table below includes the Corporation s nonperforming
    loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans
    accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2010
    and 2009. Nonperforming loans and leases exclude performing TDRs
    and loans accounted for under the fair value option.
    Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and
    leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of
    cost or fair value. In addition, PCI, consumer credit card,
    business card loans and in general, consumer

loans not secured by real estate, including renegotiated loans,
    are not considered nonperforming and are therefore excluded from
    nonperforming loans and leases in the table. See
     Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting
    Principles  for further information on the criteria to
    determine if a loan is classified as nonperforming. Real
    estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are
    reported as performing since the principal repayment is insured
    by the FHA.

Residential mortgage loans accruing
    past due 90 days or more represent loans insured by the
    FHA. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgage
    includes $8.3 billion and $2.2 billion of loans that
    are no longer accruing interest as interest has been curtailed
    by the FHA although principal is still insured.

n/a = not applicable

Included in certain loan categories in nonperforming loans and
    leases in the table above are TDRs that were classified as
    nonperforming. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Corporation had $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion of
    residential mortgages, $535 million and $1.7 billion
    of home equity, $75 million and $43 million of
    discontinued real estate, $175 million and

    loans that were TDRs and classified as nonperforming.

As a result of new accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning
    January 1, 2010, modification of a PCI loan no longer
    results in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. TDRs in
    the consumer real estate portfolio that were removed from the
    PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of the new accounting
    guidance were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, of which $426 million and
    $395 million were nonperforming. These nonperforming loans
    are excluded from the table above.

Credit Quality
    Indicators  

The Corporation monitors credit quality within its three
    portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators.
    Within the home loans portfolio segment, the primary credit
    quality indicators used are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO
    score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan

as a percentage of the value of property securing the loan,
    refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are measured using
    combined LTV which measures the carrying value of the combined
    loans that have liens against the property and the available
    line of credit as a percentage of the appraised value of the
    property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Refreshed FICO
    score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the
    financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower s
    credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed
    quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. Refreshed FICO
    score is also a primary credit quality indicator for the credit
    card and other consumer portfolio segment and the business card
    portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. The
    Corporation s commercial loans are evaluated using pass
    rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality
    indicator. The term reservable criticized refers to those
    commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the
    Corporation as special mention, substandard or doubtful. These
    assets pose an elevated risk and may have a high probability of
    default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not
    considered criticized. In addition to these primary credit
    quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality
    indicators for certain types of loans.
    See  Note 1   Summary of Significant
    Accounting Principles  for additional information.

(3)   

Refreshed LTV is reported using a
    combined LTV, which measures the carrying value of the combined
    loans with liens against the property and the available line of
    credit as a percentage of the appraised value securing the loan.

(4)   

Credit quality indicators are not
    reported for FHA insured loans as principal repayment is insured
    by the FHA.

Credit Card
    and Other Consumer

Impaired Loans
    and Troubled Debt Restructurings  

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information
    and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable
    to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with
    the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include
    nonperforming commercial loans, all TDRs, including

both commercial and consumer TDRs, and the renegotiated credit
    card, consumer lending and small business loan portfolios (the
    renegotiated portfolio). Impaired loans exclude nonperforming
    consumer loans unless they are classified as TDRs, all
    commercial leases and all loans accounted for under the fair
    value option. PCI loans are reported separately on page 171.

Table of Contents   

The following tables present impaired loans related to the
    Corporation s home loans and commercial loan portfolio
    segments at December 31, 2010. Certain impaired home loans
    and commercial loans do not have a related allowance as the
    valuation of these impaired loans, determined under current
    accounting guidance, exceeded the carrying value.

n/a = not applicable

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, remaining commitments to
    lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified
    in a commercial or consumer TDR were immaterial.

The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing
    financial difficulty by renegotiating loans within the
    renegotiated portfolio while ensuring compliance with Federal
    Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines.
    Substantially all modifications in the renegotiated portfolio
    are considered to be both TDRs and impaired loans. The
    renegotiated portfolio may include modifications, both short-
    and long-term, of interest rates or payment amounts or a
    combination thereof. The Corporation makes loan

modifications, primarily utilizing internal renegotiation
    programs via direct customer contact, that manage
    customers  debt exposures held only by the Corporation.
    Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications with
    consumers who have elected to work with external renegotiation
    agencies and these modifications provide solutions to
    customers  entire unsecured debt structures. Under both
    internal and external programs, customers receive reduced annual
    percentage rates with fixed payments that amortize loan balances
    over a
     60-month 
    period. Under both programs, for credit card loans, a
    customer s charging privileges are revoked.

Table of Contents   

The following tables provide detailed information on the
    Corporation s primary modification programs for the
    renegotiated portfolio. At December 31, 2010, all
    renegotiated credit card and other consumer loans were
    considered impaired and have a related allowance as shown in the
    table below. The allowance for credit

card loans is based on the present value of projected cash
    flows discounted using the interest rate in effect prior to
    restructuring and prior to any risk-based or penalty-based
    increase in rate.

Impaired

    Principles  for additional information.

Renegotiated
    TDR Portfolio   

n/a = not applicable

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had a
    renegotiated TDR portfolio of $12.1 billion and
    $8.1 billion of which $9.2 billion was current or less
    than 30 days past due under the modified terms at
    December 31, 2010. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is
    excluded from nonperforming loans as the Corporation generally
    does not classify consumer loans not secured by real

estate as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off
    no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes
    180 days past due. Current period amounts include the
    impact of new consolidation guidance which resulted in the
    consolidation of credit card and certain other securitization
    trusts.

Purchased
    Credit-impaired Loans  

PCI loans are acquired loans with evidence of credit quality
    deterioration since origination for which it is probable at
    purchase date that the Corporation will be unable to collect all
    contractually required payments. In connection with the
    Countrywide acquisition in 2008, the Corporation acquired PCI
    loans, substantially all of which were residential mortgage,
    home equity and discontinued real estate loans. In connection
    with the Merrill Lynch acquisition in 2009, the Corporation
    acquired PCI loans, substantially all of which were residential
    mortgage and commercial loans.

The table below presents the remaining unpaid principal balance
    and carrying amount, excluding the valuation reserve, for PCI
    loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See
     Note 7   Allowance for Credit Losses  for
    additional information.

As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance on PCI
    loans, beginning January 1, 2010, pooled loans that are
    modified subsequent to acquisition are not removed from the PCI
    loan pools and are not considered TDRs. Prior to January 1,
    2010, pooled loans that were modified subsequent to acquisition
    were reviewed to compare modified contractual cash flows to

the PCI carrying value. If the present value of the modified
    cash flows was less than the carrying value, the loan was
    removed from the PCI loan pool at its carrying value, as well as
    any related allowance for loan and lease losses, and was
    classified as a TDR. The carrying value of PCI loan TDRs that
    were removed from the PCI pool prior to January 1, 2010
    totaled $2.1 billion. At December 31, 2010,
    $1.6 billion of those classified as TDRs were on accrual
    status. The carrying value of these modified loans, net of
    allowance, was approximately 65 percent of the unpaid
    principal balance.

The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI
    loans. The $14 million and $1.4 billion
    reclassifications to nonaccretable difference during 2010 and
    2009 reflect a reduction in estimated interest cash flows during
    the year.

Loans
     Held-for-Sale   

The Corporation had LHFS of $35.1 billion and
    $43.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Proceeds
    from sales, securitizations and paydowns of LHFS were
    $281.7 billion, $365.1 billion and $142.1 billion
    for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Proceeds used for originations and
    purchases of LHFS were $263.0 billion, $369.4 billion
    and $127.5 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

NOTE 7  Allowance
    for Credit Losses   

The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for
    credit losses for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

n/a = not applicable

In 2010, the Corporation recorded $2.2 billion in provision
    for credit losses with a corresponding increase in the valuation
    reserve included as part of the allowance for loan and lease
    losses specifically for the PCI loan portfolio. This compared to
    $3.5 billion in 2009 and $750 million in 2008. The
    amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses associated
    with the PCI loan portfolio was $6.4 billion,
    $3.9 billion and $750 million at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The  other  amount under allowance for loan and lease
    losses for 2009 includes a $750 million reduction in the
    allowance for loan and lease losses related to $8.5 billion
    of credit card loans that were exchanged for a $7.8 billion
    HTM debt security partially offset by a $340 million
    increase associated with the reclassification to other assets of
    the amount reimbursable under residential mortgage cash
    collateralized synthetic securitizations. The 2008

other  amount under allowance for loan and lease
    losses includes the $1.2 billion addition of the
    Countrywide allowance for loan losses as of July 1, 2008.

The  other  amount under the reserve for unfunded
    lending commitments for 2009 includes the remaining balance of
    the acquired Merrill Lynch reserve excluding those commitments
    accounted for under the fair value option, net of accretion, and
    the impact of funding previously unfunded positions. This amount
    in 2010 represents primarily accretion of the Merrill Lynch
    purchase accounting adjustment and the impact of funding
    previously unfunded positions.

The table below represents the allowance and the carrying value
    of outstanding loans and leases by portfolio segment at
    December 31, 2010.

(1)   

Impaired loans include
    nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs, including both
    commercial and consumer TDRs. Impaired loans exclude
    nonperforming consumer loans unless they are classified as TDRs,
    and all commercial loans and leases which are accounted for
    under the fair value option.

(2)   

Commercial impaired allowance for
    loan and lease losses includes $445 million related to U.S.
    small business commercial renegotiated TDR loans.

(3)   

Outstanding loan and lease balances
    and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair
    value option. Loans accounted for under the fair value option
    were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010.

NOTE 8  Securitizations
    and Other Variable Interest Entities   

The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business
    to support its own and its customers  financing and
    investing needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and
    debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the
    Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of
    the loans or debt securities to third parties. The Corporation
    also administers structures or invests in other VIEs including
    CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities.

A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity
    investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the
    entity through their equity investments. The entity that has a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the
    primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. In accordance with
    the new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010,
    the Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial
    interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both
    the power to direct the activities of the VIE

that most significantly impact the VIE s economic
    performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to
    receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE. As a result of this change in accounting, the Corporation
    consolidated certain VIEs and former QSPEs that were previously
    unconsolidated. Incremental assets of newly consolidated VIEs on
    January 1, 2010, after elimination of intercompany balances
    and net of deferred taxes, included $69.7 billion in credit
    card securitizations, $15.6 billion in commercial paper
    conduits, $4.7 billion in home equity securitizations,
    $4.7 billion in municipal bond trusts and $5.7 billion
    in other VIEs. The net incremental impact of this accounting
    change on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet is
    set forth in the table below. The net effect of the accounting
    change on January 1, 2010 shareholders  equity
    was a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings,
     net-of-tax, 
    primarily from the increase in the allowance for loan and lease
    losses, as well as a $116 million charge to accumulated
    OCI,
     net-of-tax, 
    for the net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities in newly
    consolidated VIEs.

Bank of America
    2010        173  

Table of Contents   

The following tables present the assets and liabilities of
    consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, in situations where the Corporation has continuing
    involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation
    otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also
    present the Corporation s maximum exposure to loss at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 resulting from its involvement
    with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the
    Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation s
    maximum exposure to loss is based on the unlikely event that all
    of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not
    only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the
    Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential
    losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as
    unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual
    arrangements. The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss
    does not include losses previously recognized through
    write-downs of assets on the Corporation s Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

The Corporation invests in asset-backed securities issued by
    third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement.
    These securities are included in  Note 3  
    Trading Account Assets and Liabilities  and
     Note 5   Securities.  In addition, the
    Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts
    in connection with its funding activities as described in
     Note 13   Long-term Debt . The Corporation
    also uses VIEs in the form of synthetic securitization vehicles
    to mitigate a portion of the credit risk on its residential
    mortgage loan portfolio, as described in
     Note 6   Outstanding Loans and Leases . The
    Corporation uses VIEs, such as cash funds managed within
     GWIM , to provide investment opportunities for clients.
    Prior to 2010, the Corporation provided support to certain of
    these cash funds in the form of capital commitments in the event
    the net asset value per unit of a fund declined below certain
    thresholds. The Corporation recorded a loss of

$195 million in 2009 as the result of these commitments,
    which were terminated in 2009. These VIEs, which are not
    consolidated by the Corporation, are not included in the tables
    within this Note.

Except as described below and with regard to the cash funds, as
    of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has not provided
    financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs that it
    was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does
    it intend to do so.

Mortgage-related
    Securitizations  

First-lien
    Mortgages  

As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation
    securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage
    loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally
    in the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs, or GNMA in the case of
    FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs
    (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization occurs in
    conjunction with or shortly after loan closing or purchase. In
    addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize
    commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other
    entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it
    securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial
    interests in the securitization trusts including senior and
    subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts.
    Except as described below and in  Note 9  
    Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate
    Guarantees , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or
    recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard
    representations and warranties.

The table below summarizes select information related to
    first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

The Corporation sells residential
    mortgage loans to GSEs in the normal course of business and
    receives MBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market
    to third-party investors for cash proceeds.

(2)   

Substantially all of the first-lien
    residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified
    as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. As such,
    gains are recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization.
    During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation recognized
    $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion of gains on these LHFS,
    net of hedges.

In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the
    Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of
    $23.7 billion in connection with agency first-lien
    residential mortgage securitizations in 2010. All of these
    securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets
    within the fair value hierarchy. During 2010, there were no
    changes to the initial classification.

The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or
    securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and
    ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced,
    including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing
    involvement, were $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion in
    2010 and 2009. Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans,
    including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing
    involvement, were $24.3 billion and $19.3 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Corporation may have the
    option to repurchase delinquent loans out of

securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing
    advances it is required to make. During 2010 and 2009,
    $14.5 billion and $13.1 billion of loans were
    repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts as a result of
    loan delinquencies or in order to perform modifications. The
    majority of these loans repurchased were FHA insured mortgages
    collateralizing GNMA securities. In addition, the Corporation
    has retained commercial MSRs from the sale or securitization of
    commercial mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee
    income on commercial mortgage loans serviced, including
    securitizations where the Corporation has continuing
    involvement, were $21 million and $49 million in 2010
    and 2009. Servicing advances on commercial mortgage loans,
    including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing
    involvement, were $156 million and $109 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Home Equity
    Mortgages  

The Corporation maintains interests in home equity
    securitization trusts to which the Corporation transferred home
    equity loans. These retained interests include senior and
    subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the
    Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to
    the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation
    also services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below
    and in  Note 9   Representations and Warranties
    Obligations and Corporate Guarantees , the Corporation does
    not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts
    other

than standard representations and warranties. There were no
    securitizations of home equity loans during 2010 and 2009.
    Collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations were
    $21 million and $177 million during 2010 and 2009.
    Cash flows received on residual interests were $12 million
    and $35 million in 2010 and 2009.

The table below summarizes select information related to home
    equity loan securitization trusts in which the Corporation held
    a variable interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

For unconsolidated VIEs, the
    maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates
    issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded
    reserves, and excludes the liability for representations and
    warranties and corporate guarantees.

(2)   

At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    $204 million and $15 million of the debt securities
    classified as trading account assets were senior securities and
    $5 million and $1 million were subordinate securities.

(3)   

As a holder of these securities,
    the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest
    payments. During 2010 and 2009, there were no OTTI losses
    recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities.

(4)   

At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    $35 million and $47 million represent subordinate debt
    securities held. At December 31, 2009, $100 million
    are residual interests classified as AFS debt securities.

Under the terms of the Corporation s home equity loan
    securitizations, advances are made to borrowers when they draw
    on their lines of credit and the Corporation is reimbursed for
    those advances from the cash flows in the securitization. During
    the revolving period of the securitization, this reimbursement
    normally occurs within a short period after the advance.
    However, when certain securitization transactions have begun a
    rapid amortization period, reimbursement of the
    Corporation s advance occurs only after other parties in
    the securitization have received all of the cash flows to which
    they are entitled. This has the effect of extending the time
    period for which the Corporation s advances are
    outstanding. In addition, if loan losses requiring draws on
    monoline insurers  policies, which protect the bondholders
    in the securitization, exceed a specified threshold or duration,
    the Corporation may not receive reimbursement for all of the
    funds advanced to borrowers, as the senior bondholders and the
    monoline insurers have priority for repayment.

Substantially all of the home equity loan securitizations for
    which the Corporation has an obligation to provide subordinate
    advances have entered rapid amortization. The Corporation
    evaluates each of these securitizations for potential losses due
    to non-recoverable advances by estimating the amount and timing
    of future losses on the underlying loans, the excess spread
    available to cover such losses and potential cash flow
    shortfalls during rapid amortization. A maximum funding
    obligation attributable to rapid

amortization cannot be calculated as a home equity borrower has
    the ability to pay down and re-draw balances. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, home equity loan securitization
    transactions in rapid amortization, including both consolidated
    and unconsolidated trusts, had $12.5 billion and
    $14.1 billion of trust certificates outstanding. This
    amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation
    expects to fund. At December 31, 2010, the remaining
    $93 million of trust certificates outstanding related to
    these types of securitization transactions are expected to enter
    rapid amortization during the next 12 months. The charges
    that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid
    amortization events depend on the performance of the loans, the
    amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the reserve for losses on
    expected future draw obligations on the home equity loan
    securitizations in or expected to be in rapid amortization was
    $131 million and $178 million.

The Corporation has consumer MSRs from the sale or
    securitization of home equity loans. The Corporation recorded
    $79 million and $128 million of servicing fee income
    related to home equity securitizations during 2010 and 2009. The
    Corporation repurchased $17 million and $31 million of
    loans from home equity securitization trusts in order to perform
    modifications or pursuant to clean up calls during 2010 and 2009.

Credit Card
    Securitizations  

The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card
    loans. The Corporation s continuing involvement with the
    securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables,
    retaining an undivided interest (seller s interest) in the
    receivables, and holding certain retained interests including
    senior and subordinate securities, discount receivables,
    subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the
    securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The
    Corporation consolidated all credit card securitization trusts
    on

January 1, 2010 in accordance with new consolidation
    guidance. Certain retained interests, including senior and
    subordinate securities, were eliminated in consolidation. The
    seller s interest in the trusts, which is pari passu to the
    investors  interest, and the discount receivables continue
    to be classified in loans and leases.

The table below summarizes select information related to credit
    card securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a
    variable interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

At December 31, 2009, maximum
    loss exposure represents the total retained interests held by
    the Corporation and also includes $2.3 billion related to a
    liquidity support commitment the Corporation provided to one of
    the U.S. Credit Card Securitization Trust s commercial
    paper program. This commercial paper program was terminated in
    2010.

(2)   

As a holder of these securities,
    the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest
    payments. During 2009, there were no OTTI losses recorded on
    those securities classified as AFS or HTM debt securities.

(3)   

At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    loans and leases includes $20.4 billion and
    $10.8 billion of seller s interest and
    $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion of discount receivables.

(4)   

At December 31, 2010, all
    other assets includes restricted cash accounts and unbilled
    accrued interest and fees. At December 31, 2009, all other
    assets includes discount subordinate interests in accrued
    interest and fees on the securitized receivables, cash reserve
    accounts and interest-only strips which are carried at fair
    value.

During 2010, $2.9 billion of new senior debt securities
    were issued to external investors from the credit card
    securitization trusts. There were no new debt securities issued
    to external investors from the credit card securitization trusts
    during 2009. Collections reinvested in revolving period
    securitizations were $133.8 billion and cash flows received
    on residual interests were $5.5 billion during 2009.

At December 31, 2009, there were no recognized servicing
    assets or liabilities associated with any of the credit card
    securitization transactions. The Corporation recorded
    $2.0 billion in servicing fees related to credit card
    securitizations during 2009.

During 2010 and 2009, subordinate securities with a notional
    principal amount of $11.5 billion and $7.8 billion and
    a stated interest rate of zero percent were issued by certain
    credit card securitization trusts to the Corporation. In
    addition, the Corporation has elected to designate a specified
    percentage of new receivables transferred to the trusts as
     discount

receivables  such that principal collections thereon are
    added to finance charges which increases the yield in the trust.
    Through the designation of newly transferred receivables as
    discount receivables, the Corporation has subordinated a portion
    of its seller s interest to the investors  interest.
    These actions, which were specifically permitted by the terms of
    the trust documents, were taken in an effort to address the
    decline in the excess spread of the U.S. and U.K. Credit
    Card Securitization Trusts. As these trusts were consolidated on
    January 1, 2010, the issuance of subordinate securities and
    the discount receivables election had no impact on the
    Corporation s consolidated results during 2010 or 2009. At
    December 31, 2009, the carrying amount and fair value of
    the retained subordinate securities were $6.6 billion and
    $6.4 billion. These balances were eliminated on
    January 1, 2010 with the consolidation of the trusts. The
    outstanding principal balance of discount receivables, which are
    classified in loans and leases, was $3.8 billion and
    $4.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Other
    Asset-backed Securitizations  

Other asset-backed securitizations include resecuritization
    trusts, municipal bond trusts, and automobile and other
    securitization trusts. The table below summarizes select
    information related to other asset-backed securitizations in
    which the Corporation held a variable interest at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

As a holder of these securities,
    the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest
    payments. During 2010 and 2009, there were no significant OTTI
    losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt
    securities.

(2)   

The retained senior and subordinate
    securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable
    market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).

(3)   

The retained residual interests are
    carried at fair value which was derived using model valuations
    (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).

Resecuritization
    Trusts  

The Corporation transfers existing securities, typically MBS,
    into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers
    seeking securities with specific characteristics. The
    Corporation may also enter into resecuritizations of securities
    within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving
    liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate
    risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities
    performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has
    the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.

During 2010, the Corporation resecuritized $97.7 billion of
    MBS, including $71.3 billion of securities purchased from
    third parties compared to $49.2 billion in 2009. Net losses
    upon sale totaled $144 million during 2010 compared to net
    gains of $213 million in 2009. The Corporation consolidates
    a resecuritization trust if it has sole discretion over the
    design of the trust, including the identification of securities
    to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be
    issued, and also retains a variable interest that could
    potentially be significant to the trust. If one or a limited
    number of third-party investors share responsibility for the
    design of the trust and purchase a significant portion of
    subordinate securities, the Corporation does not consolidate the
    trust. Prior to 2010, these resecuritization trusts were
    typically QSPEs and as such were not subject to consolidation by
    the Corporation.

Municipal Bond
    Trusts  

The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold
    highly rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The vast
    majority of the bonds are rated AAA or AA and some of the bonds
    benefit from insurance provided by monolines. The trusts obtain
    financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that
    reprice on a weekly or other basis to third-party investors. The
    Corporation may serve as remarketing agent
     and/or 
    liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors
    have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates,
    often with as little as seven days  notice. Should the
    Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it
    is generally obligated to purchase them at par under standby
    liquidity facilities unless the bond s credit rating has
    declined below investment-grade or there has been an event of
    default or bankruptcy of the issuer and insurer.

178        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in
    certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees
    the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate
    certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by
    the issuer of the underlying municipal bond. If a customer holds
    the residual interest in a trust, that customer typically has
    the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust at any time, while
    the Corporation typically has the ability to trigger the
    liquidation of that trust if the market value of the bonds held
    in the trust declines below a specified threshold. This
    arrangement is designed to limit market losses to an amount that
    is less than the customer s residual interest, effectively
    preventing the Corporation from absorbing losses incurred on
    assets held within that trust. The weighted-average remaining
    life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2010 was
    13.3 years. There were no material write-downs or
    downgrades of assets or issuers during 2010.

During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation was the transferor of
    assets into unconsolidated municipal bond trusts and received
    cash proceeds from new securitizations of $1.2 billion and
    $664 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    principal balance outstanding for unconsolidated municipal bond
    securitization trusts for which the Corporation was transferor
    was $2.2 billion and $6.9 billion.

The Corporation s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated
    municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation
    was transferor, totaled $4.0 billion and $9.8 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Automobile and
    Other Securitization Trusts  

The Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into
    securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage
    credit risk. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation serviced
    assets or otherwise had continuing

involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with
    outstanding balances of $10.5 billion, including trusts
    collateralized by automobile loans of $8.4 billion, student
    loans of $1.3 billion, and other loans and receivables of
    $774 million. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation
    serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with
    automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding
    balances of $11.9 billion, including trusts collateralized
    by automobile loans of $11.0 billion and other loans of
    $905 million. The Corporation transferred $3.0 billion
    of automobile loans, $1.3 billion of student loans and
    $303 million of other receivables to the trusts during 2010
    and $9.0 billion of automobile loans during 2009.

Multi-seller
    Conduits  

The Corporation previously administered four multi-seller
    conduits which provided a low-cost funding alternative to the
    conduits  customers by facilitating access to the
    commercial paper market. These customers sold or otherwise
    transferred assets to the conduits, which in turn issued
    short-term commercial paper that was rated high-grade and was
    collateralized by the underlying assets. The Corporation
    provided combinations of liquidity and SBLCs to the conduits for
    the benefit of third-party investors. These commitments had an
    aggregate notional amount outstanding of $34.5 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The Corporation liquidated the four
    conduits and terminated all liquidity and other commitments
    during 2010. Liquidation of the conduits did not impact the
    Corporation s consolidated results of operations.

The table below summarizes select information related to
    multi-seller conduits in which the Corporation held a variable
    interest at December 31, 2009.

Collateralized
    Debt Obligation Vehicles  

CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities,
    typically corporate debt or asset-backed securities, which they
    fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities.
    Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of credit default swaps to
    synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs
    are a subset of CDOs which hold pools of loans, typically
    corporate loans or commercial mortgages. CDOs are typically
    managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation
    transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the
    CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including
    a credit default swap counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The

Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with
    certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic
    returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO. The
    Corporation receives fees for structuring CDOs and providing
    liquidity support for super senior tranches of securities issued
    by certain CDOs. No third parties provide a significant amount
    of similar commitments to these CDOs.

The table below summarizes select information related to CDO
    vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

Maximum loss exposure is net of
    credit protection purchased from the CDO with which the
    Corporation has involvement but has not been reduced to reflect
    the benefit of insurance purchased from other third parties.

The Corporation s maximum loss exposure of
    $6.8 billion at December 31, 2010 includes
    $1.8 billion of super senior CDO exposure,
    $2.2 billion of exposure to CDO financing facilities and
    $2.8 billion of other non-super senior exposure. This
    exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any
    benefit from insurance purchased from third parties other than
    the CDO itself. Net of purchased insurance but including
    securities retained from liquidations of CDOs, the
    Corporation s net exposure to super senior CDO-related
    positions was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The
    CDO financing facilities, which are consolidated, obtain funding
    from third parties for CDO positions which are principally
    classified in trading account assets on the Corporation s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CDO financing facilities 
    long-term debt at December 31, 2010 totaled
    $2.6 billion, all of which has recourse to the general
    credit of the Corporation.

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had $951 million
    notional amount of super senior CDO liquidity exposure,
    including derivatives and other exposures with third parties
    that hold super senior cash positions on the Corporation s
    behalf and to certain synthetic CDOs through which the
    Corporation is obligated to purchase super senior CDO securities
    at par value if the CDOs

need cash to make payments due under credit default swaps
    written by the CDO vehicles. Liquidity-related commitments also
    include $1.7 billion notional amount of derivative
    contracts with unconsolidated special purpose entities (SPEs),
    principally CDO vehicles, which hold non-super senior CDO debt
    securities or other debt securities on the Corporation s
    behalf. These derivatives comprise substantially all of the
    $1.7 billion notional amount of derivative contracts
    through which the Corporation obtains funding from third-party
    SPEs, as described in  Note 14   Commitments
    and Contingencies.  The Corporation s $2.7 billion
    of aggregate liquidity exposure to CDOs at December 31,
    2010 is included in the table above to the extent that the
    Corporation sponsored the CDO vehicle or the liquidity exposure
    is more than insignificant compared to total assets of the CDO
    vehicle. Liquidity exposure included in the table is reported
    net of previously recorded losses.

The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss is significantly
    less than the total assets of the CDO vehicles in the table
    above because the Corporation typically has exposure to only a
    portion of the total assets. The Corporation has also purchased
    credit protection from some of the same CDO vehicles in which it
    invested, thus reducing the Corporation s maximum exposure
    to loss.

Customer
    Vehicles  

Customer vehicles include credit-linked and equity-linked note
    vehicles, repackaging vehicles and asset acquisition vehicles,
    which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to
    obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company or
    financial instrument.

The table below summarizes select information related to
    customer vehicles in which the Corporation held a variable
    interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles issue notes which
    pay a return that is linked to the credit or equity risk of a
    specified company or debt instrument. The vehicles purchase
    high-grade assets as collateral and enter into credit default
    swaps or equity derivatives to synthetically create the credit
    or equity risk to pay the specified return on the notes. The
    Corporation is typically the counterparty for some or all of the
    credit and equity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, it may
    invest in securities issued by the vehicles. The Corporation may
    also enter into interest rate or foreign currency derivatives
    with the vehicles. The Corporation also had approximately
    $338 million of other liquidity commitments, including
    written put options and collateral value guarantees, with
    unconsolidated credit-linked and equity-linked note vehicles at
    December 31, 2010.

Repackaging vehicles issue notes that are designed to
    incorporate risk characteristics desired by customers. The
    vehicles hold debt instruments such as corporate bonds,
    convertible bonds or asset-backed securities with the desired
    credit risk profile. The Corporation enters into derivatives
    with the vehicles to change the interest rate or foreign
    currency profile of the debt instruments. If a vehicle holds
    convertible bonds and the Corporation retains

the conversion option, the Corporation is deemed to have
    controlling financial interest and consolidates the vehicle.

Asset acquisition vehicles acquire financial instruments,
    typically loans, at the direction of a single customer and
    obtain funding through the issuance of structured notes to the
    Corporation. At the time the vehicle acquires an asset, the
    Corporation enters into total return swaps with the customer
    such that the economic returns of the asset are passed through
    to the customer. The Corporation is exposed to counterparty
    credit risk if the asset declines in value and the customer
    defaults on its obligation to the Corporation under the total
    return swaps. The Corporation s risk may be mitigated by
    collateral or other arrangements. The Corporation consolidates
    these vehicles because it has the power to manage the assets in
    the vehicles and owns all of the structured notes issued by the
    vehicles.

The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss from customer
    vehicles includes the notional amount of the credit or equity
    derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of
    losses previously recorded, and the Corporation s
    investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. It has
    not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with
    the customers or collateral arrangements.

Other Variable
    Interest Entities  

Other consolidated VIEs primarily include investment vehicles, a
    collective investment fund, leveraged lease trusts and asset
    acquisition conduits. Other unconsolidated VIEs primarily
    include investment vehicles and real estate vehicles.

The table below summarizes select information related to other
    VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Investment
    Vehicles  

The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing to a
    variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate,
    debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed
    to provide the desired investment profile to investors. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation s
    consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of
    $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion. The Corporation also
    held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of
    $7.9 billion and $8.8 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009. The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss
    associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment
    vehicles totaled $8.7 billion and $10.7 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

On January 1, 2010, the Corporation consolidated
    $2.5 billion of investment vehicles. This amount included a
    real estate investment fund with assets of $1.5 billion
    which is designed to provide returns to clients through limited
    partnership holdings. At that time, the Corporation was the
    general partner and also had a limited partnership interest in
    the fund. The Corporation provided support to the fund and
    therefore considers the fund to be a VIE. In late 2010, the
    Corporation transferred its general partnership interest to a
    third party, conveying all ongoing management responsibilities
    to that third party. As a result, the Corporation deconsolidated
    the fund because it no longer has a controlling financial
    interest. The Corporation continues to retain a limited
    partnership interest, which is included in the table above.

Collective
    Investment Funds  

The Corporation is trustee for certain common and collective
    investment funds that provide investment opportunities for
    eligible clients of  GWIM . These funds, which had total
    assets of $21.2 billion at December 31, 2010, hold a
    variety of cash, debt and equity investments. The Corporation
    does not have a variable interest in these funds, except as
    described below.

In 2010, the governing documents of a stable value collective
    investment fund with total assets of $8.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010 were modified to facilitate the planned
    liquidation of the fund. The modifications resulted in the
    termination of third-party insurance contracts which were
    replaced by a guarantee from the Corporation of the net asset
    value of the fund, which principally holds short-term
    U.S. Treasury and agency securities. In addition, the
    Corporation acquired the unilateral ability to replace the
    fund s asset manager. As a result of these changes, the
    Corporation acquired a controlling financial interest in and
    consolidated the fund. Consolidation did not have a significant
    impact on the Corporation s 2010 results of operations.
    This fund was not previously consolidated because the
    Corporation did not have the unilateral power to replace the
    asset manager, nor did it have a variable interest in the fund
    that was more than insignificant. Liquidation of the fund will
    be finalized in 2011.

Leveraged Lease
    Trusts  

The Corporation s net investment in consolidated leveraged
    lease trusts totaled $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The trusts hold long-lived
    equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution
    equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures
    the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net
    investment represents the Corporation s maximum loss
    exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged
    lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged
    lease trusts is nonrecourse to the Corporation. The Corporation
    has no liquidity exposure to these leveraged lease trusts.

Asset Acquisition
    Conduits  

The Corporation currently administers two asset acquisition
    conduits which acquire assets on behalf of the Corporation or
    its customers. The Corporation liquidated a third conduit during
    2010. Liquidation of the conduit did not impact the
    Corporation s consolidated results of operations.

These conduits had total assets of $640 million and
    $2.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. One of the
    conduits acquires assets at the request of customers who wish to
    benefit from the economic returns of the specified assets on a
    leveraged basis, which consist principally of liquid
    exchange-traded equity securities. The second conduit holds
    subordinate AFS debt securities for the Corporation s
    benefit. The conduits obtain funding by issuing commercial paper
    and subordinate certificates to third-party investors. Repayment
    of the commercial paper and certificates is assured by total
    return swaps between the Corporation and the conduits. When a
    conduit acquires assets for the benefit of the
    Corporation s customers, the Corporation enters into
     back-to-back 
    total return swaps with the conduit and the customer such that
    the economic returns of the assets are passed through to the
    customer. The Corporation s exposure to the counterparty
    credit risk of its customers is mitigated by the ability to
    liquidate an asset held in the conduit if the customer defaults
    on its obligation. The Corporation receives fees for serving as
    commercial paper placement agent and for providing
    administrative services to the conduits. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the Corporation did not hold any commercial paper
    issued by the asset acquisition conduits other than incidentally
    and in its role as a commercial paper dealer.

Real Estate
    Vehicles  

The Corporation held investments in unconsolidated real estate
    vehicles of $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, which consisted of limited
    partnership investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships
    that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable
    rental housing. An unrelated third party is typically the
    general partner and has control over the significant activities
    of the partnership. The Corporation earns a return primarily
    through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the affordable
    housing projects. The Corporation s risk of loss is
    mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the
    expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The
    Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional
    amounts to support a troubled project. Such additional
    investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.

Other
    Transactions  

In 2010 and prior years, the Corporation transferred pools of
    securities to certain independent third parties and provided
    financing for approximately 75 percent of the purchase
    price under asset-backed financing arrangements. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation s maximum
    loss exposure under these financing arrangements was
    $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion, substantially all of
    which was classified as loans on the Corporation s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. All principal and interest payments
    have been received when due in accordance with their contractual
    terms. These arrangements are not included in the table on
    page 182 because the purchasers are not VIEs.

NOTE 9  Representations
    and Warranties Obligations and Corporate
    Guarantees   

Background  

The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage
    loans, generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs or GNMA
    in the case of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans. In
    addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain
    subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage
    loans, home equity loans and other second-lien loans as
    private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In
    connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain
    subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations
    and warranties. These representations and warranties, as
    governed by the agreements, related to, among other things, the
    ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the
    loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the
    property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan
    for inclusion in a transaction, the loan s compliance with
    any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards,
    and the loan s compliance with applicable federal, state
    and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties
    may result in a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans, or to
    otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a whole-loan
    buyer or securitization trust. In such cases, the Corporation
    would be exposed to any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage
    loans. The Corporation s credit loss would be reduced by
    any recourse to sellers of loans (i.e., correspondents) for
    representations and warranties previously provided. When a loan
    was originated by a third-party correspondent, the Corporation
    typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase
    losses from the correspondent originator. At December 31,
    2010, loans purchased from correspondents comprised
    approximately 25 percent of loans underlying outstanding
    repurchase demands. During 2010, the Corporation experienced a
    decrease in recoveries from correspondents, however, the actual
    recovery rate may vary from period to period based upon the
    underlying mix of correspondents (e.g., active, inactive,
     out-of-business 
    originators) from which recoveries are sought.

Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable
    agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced
    by the securitization trustee or the whole-loan buyer as
    governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien
    and home equity securitizations where monolines have insured all
    or some of the related bonds issued, by the monoline insurer at
    any time over the life of the loan. Importantly, in the case of
    non-GSE loans, the contractual liability to repurchase arises if
    there is a breach of the representations and warranties that
    materially and adversely affects the interest of all investors,
    or if there is a breach of other standards established by the
    terms of the related sale agreement. The Corporation believes
    that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less
    likely it is that an alleged underwriting breach of
    representations and warranties had a material impact on the
    loan s performance. Historically, most demands for
    repurchase have occurred within the first few years after
    origination, generally after a loan has defaulted. However, in
    recent periods the time horizon has lengthened due to increased
    repurchase request activity across all vintages.

The Corporation s current operations are structured to
    limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by
    seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in
    accordance with its underwriting procedures and by servicing
    those mortgages consistent with its contractual obligations. In
    addition, certain securitizations include guarantees written to
    protect certain purchasers of the loans from credit losses up to
    a specified amount. The fair value of the probable losses to be
    absorbed under the representations and warranties obligations
    and the guarantees is recorded as an accrued liability when the
    loans are sold. The liability for probable losses is updated by
    accruing a representations and warranties provision in mortgage
    banking income throughout the life of the loan as necessary when
    additional relevant information becomes available. The
    methodology used to estimate

Bank of America
    2010        183  

Table of Contents   

the liability for representations and warranties is a function
    of the representations and warranties given and considers a
    variety of factors, which include, depending on the
    counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults,
    historical loss experience, estimated home prices, probability
    that a repurchase request will be received, number of payments
    made by the borrower prior to default and probability that a
    loan will be required to be repurchased. Historical experience
    also considers recent events such as the agreements with the
    GSEs on December 31, 2010, as discussed below. Changes to
    any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate
    of the Corporation s liability.

Although the timing and volume has varied, repurchase and
    similar requests have increased in recent periods from buyers
    and insurers, including monolines. The Corporation expects that
    efforts to attempt to assert repurchase requests by monolines,
    whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors
    may increase in the future. A
     loan-by-loan 
    review of all properly presented repurchase requests is
    performed and demands have been and will continue to be
    contested to the extent not considered valid. In addition, the
    Corporation may reach a bulk settlement with a counterparty (in
    lieu of the
     loan-by-loan 
    review process), on terms determined to be advantageous to the
    Corporation.

On December 31, 2010, the Corporation reached agreements
    with the GSEs under which the Corporation paid $2.8 billion
    to resolve repurchase claims involving certain residential
    mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to
    legacy Countrywide. The agreements with FHLMC for
    $1.28 billion extinguishes all outstanding and potential
    mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any
    alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties
    related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FHLMC
    through 2008, subject to certain exceptions the Corporation does
    not believe to be material. The agreement with FNMA for
    $1.52 billion substantially resolves the existing pipeline
    of repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of
    September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of
    selling representations and warranties related to loans sold
    directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with
    the GSEs do not cover legacy Bank of America first-lien
    residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs, other
    loans sold to the GSEs other than described above, loan
    servicing obligations, other contractual obligations or loans
    contained in private-label securitizations.

Overall, repurchase requests and disputes with buyers and
    insurers regarding representations and warranties have increased
    in recent periods which has resulted in an increase in
    unresolved repurchase requests for monolines and other non-GSE
    counterparties. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase
    requests from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed
    securities is not significant because the requests are limited
    in number and are typically resolved quickly. The volume of
    repurchase claims as a percentage of the volume of loans
    purchased arising from loans sourced from brokers or purchased
    from third-party sellers is relatively consistent with the

volume of repurchase claims as a percentage of the volume of
    loans originated by the Corporation or its subsidiaries or
    legacy companies.

The table below presents outstanding claims by counterparty and
    product type at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The information
    for 2010 reflects the impact of the recent agreements with the
    GSEs.

Outstanding
    Claims by Counterparty and Product   

(1)   

December 31, 2010 includes
    $1.7 billion in claims contained in correspondence from
    private-label securitizations investors that do not have the
    right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to
    access loan files. The inclusion of these claims in the amounts
    noted does not mean that the Corporation believes these claims
    have satisfied the contractual thresholds to direct the
    securitization trustee to take action or are otherwise
    procedurally or substantively valid.

As presented in the table on page 185, during 2010 and 2009, the
    Corporation paid $5.2 billion and $2.6 billion to
    resolve $6.6 billion and $3.0 billion of repurchase
    claims through repurchase or reimbursement to the investor or
    securitization trust for losses they incurred, resulting in a
    loss on the related loans at the time of repurchase or
    reimbursement of $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion. The
    amount of loss for loan repurchases is reduced by the fair value
    of the underlying loan collateral. The repurchase of loans and
    indemnification payments related to first-lien and home equity
    repurchase claims generally resulted from material breaches of
    representations and warranties related to the loans 
    material compliance with the applicable underwriting standards,
    including borrower misrepresentation, credit exceptions without
    sufficient compensating factors and non-compliance with
    underwriting procedures, although the actual representations
    made in a sales transaction and the resulting repurchase and
    indemnification activity can vary by transaction or investor. A
    direct relationship between the type of defect that causes the
    breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the
    realized loss has not been observed. Transactions to repurchase
    or indemnification payments related to first-lien residential
    mortgages primarily involved the GSEs while transactions to
    repurchase or indemnification payments for home equity loans
    primarily involved the monolines.

The table below presents first-lien and home equity loan
    repurchases and indemnification payments for 2010 and 2009.
    These amounts include the agreement that was reached with FNMA
    as discussed on page 184. These amounts do not include
    $1.3 billion paid related to the agreement with FHLMC due
    to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the
    absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount
    between current and future claims.

Loan
    Repurchases and Indemnification Payments   

Government-sponsored
    Enterprises  

The Corporation and its subsidiaries have an established history
    of working with the GSEs on repurchase requests. Generally, the
    Corporation first becomes aware that a GSE is evaluating a
    particular loan for repurchase when the Corporation receives a
    request from a GSE to review the underlying loan file (file
    request). Upon completing its review, the GSE may submit a
    repurchase claim to the Corporation. Historically, most file
    requests have not resulted in a repurchase claim. As soon as
    practicable after receiving a repurchase request from either of
    the GSEs, the Corporation evaluates the request and takes
    appropriate action. Claim disputes are generally handled through
    loan-level negotiations with the GSEs and the Corporation seeks
    to resolve the repurchase request within 90 to 120 days of
    the receipt of the request although tolerances exist for claims
    that remain open beyond this timeframe. Experience with the GSEs
    continues to evolve and any disputes are generally related to
    areas including reasonableness of stated income, occupancy and
    undisclosed liabilities in the vintages with the highest default
    rates.

Monoline
    Insurers  

Unlike the repurchase protocols and experience established with
    GSEs, experience with the monolines has been varied and the
    protocols and experience with these counterparties has not been
    as predictable as with the GSEs. The timetable for the loan file
    request, the repurchase request, if any, response and resolution
    varies by monoline. Where a breach of representations and
    warranties given by the Corporation or subsidiaries or legacy
    companies is confirmed on a given loan, settlement is generally
    reached as to that loan within 60 to 90 days.

Properly presented repurchase requests for the monolines are
    reviewed on a
     loan-by-loan 
    basis. As part of an ongoing claims process, if the Corporation
    does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and
    generally indicate the reason for the denial to facilitate
    meaningful dialogue with the counterparty although it is not
    contractually obligated to do so. When there is disagreement as
    to the resolution of a claim, meaningful dialogue and
    negotiation is generally necessary between the parties to reach
    conclusion on an individual claim. Certain monolines have
    instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and the
    Corporation. When claims from these counterparties are denied,
    the Corporation does not indicate its reason for denial as it is
    not contractually obligated to do so. In the Corporation s
    experience, the monolines have been generally unwilling to
    withdraw repurchase claims, regardless of whether and what
    evidence was offered to refute a claim.

The pipeline of unresolved monoline claims where the Corporation
    believes a valid defect has not been identified which would
    constitute an actionable breach of representations and
    warranties continued to grow in 2010. Through December 31,
    2010, approximately 11 percent of monoline claims that the
    Corporation initially denied have subsequently been resolved
    through repurchase or make-whole payments and two percent have
    been resolved through rescission. When a claim has been denied
    and there has not been communication with the counterparty for
    six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive;
    however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until
    resolution.

A liability for representations and warranties has been
    established with respect to all monolines for monoline
    repurchase requests based on valid identified loan defects and
    for repurchase requests that are in the process of review based
    on historical repurchase experience with a specific monoline to
    the extent such experience provides a reasonable basis on which
    to estimate incurred losses from repurchase activity. With
    respect to certain monolines where the Corporation believes a
    more consistent purchase experience has been established, a
    liability has also been established related to repurchase
    requests subject to negotiation and unasserted requests to
    repurchase current and future defaulted loans. The Corporation
    has had limited experience with most of the monoline insurers in
    the repurchase process, including limited experience resolving
    disputed claims. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted
    litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which
    limits the Corporation s relationship and ability to enter
    into constructive dialogue with these monolines to resolve the
    open claims. For such monolines and other monolines with whom
    the Corporation has limited repurchase experience, in view of
    the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of those
    repurchase requests where a valid defect has not been identified
    or in predicting future claim requests and the related outcome
    in the case of unasserted requests to repurchase loans from the
    securitization trusts in which these monolines have insured all
    or some of the related bonds, the Corporation cannot reasonably
    estimate the eventual outcome. In addition, the timing of the
    ultimate resolution or the eventual loss, if any, related to
    those repurchase requests cannot be reasonably estimated. Thus,
    with respect to these monolines, a liability for representations
    and warranties has not been established related to repurchase
    requests where a valid defect has not been identified, or in the
    case of any unasserted requests to repurchase loans from the
    securitization trusts in which such monolines have insured all
    or some of the related bonds. However, certain monoline insurers
    have engaged with the Corporation and legacy Countrywide in a
    consistent

Bank of America
    2010        185  

Table of Contents   

repurchase process and the Corporation has used that experience
    to record a liability related to existing and future claims from
    such counterparties.

At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans
    related to unresolved repurchase requests previously received
    from monolines was $4.8 billion, including
    $3.0 billion in repurchase requests that have been reviewed
    where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified
    which would constitute an actionable breach of representations
    and warranties and $1.8 billion in repurchase requests that
    are in the process of review. As discussed on the previous page,
    a portion of the repurchase requests that are initially denied
    are ultimately resolved through repurchase or make-whole
    payments, after additional dialogue and negotiation with the
    monoline insurer. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid
    principal balance of loans for which the monolines had requested
    loan files for review but for which no repurchase request had
    been received was $10.2 billion, excluding loans that had
    been paid in full. There will likely be additional requests for
    loan files in the future leading to repurchase requests. Such
    requests may relate to loans that are currently in
    securitization trusts or loans that have defaulted and are no
    longer included in the unpaid principal balance of the loans in
    the trusts. However, it is unlikely that a repurchase request
    will be received for every loan in a securitization or every
    file requested or that a valid defect exists for every loan
    repurchase request. In addition, any claims paid related to
    repurchase requests from a monoline are paid to the
    securitization trust and may be used by the securitization trust
    to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future
    advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has
    not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be
    required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the
    likelihood of receiving a repurchase request from a monoline may
    be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit
    from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines
    are not currently performing their obligations under the
    financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain
    circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims.

Whole Loan Sales
    and Private-label Securitizations  

The Corporation and its subsidiaries have limited experience
    with private-label securitization repurchases as the number of
    recent repurchase requests received has been limited as shown in
    the outstanding claims table on page 184. The
    representations and warranties, as governed by the private-label
    securitizations, generally require that counterparties have the
    ability to both assert a claim and actually prove that a loan
    has an actionable defect under the applicable contracts. While a
    securitization trustee may always investigate or demand
    repurchase on its own action, in order for investors to direct
    the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand
    the repurchase of loans, the securitization agreements generally
    require the security holders to hold a specified percentage,
    such as 25 percent, of the voting rights of the outstanding
    securities. In addition, the Corporation believes the agreements
    for private-label securitizations generally contain less
    rigorous representations and warranties and higher burdens on
    investors seeking repurchases than the comparable agreements
    with the GSEs.

The majority of repurchase requests that the Corporation has
    received relate to whole loan sales. Most of the loans sold in
    the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with other
    mortgages into private-label securitizations issued by
    third-party buyers of the loans. The buyers of the whole loans
    received representations and warranties in the sales transaction
    and may retain those rights even when the loans are aggregated
    with other collateral into private-label securitizations.
    Properly presented repurchase requests for these whole loans are
    reviewed on a
     loan-by-loan 
    basis. If, after the Corporation s review, it does not
    believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally
    indicate a reason for the denial. When the counterparty agrees
    with the Corporation s denial of the claim, the
    counterparty may rescind the claim. When there is disagreement
    as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful

dialogue and negotiation between the parties is generally
    necessary to reach conclusion on an individual claim. Generally,
    a whole loan sale claimant is engaged in the repurchase process
    and the Corporation and the claimant reach resolution, either
    through
     loan-by-loan 
    negotiation or at times, through a bulk settlement. Through
    December 31, 2010, approximately 17 percent of the
    whole loan claims that the Corporation initially denied have
    subsequently been resolved through repurchase or make-whole
    payments and 53 percent have been resolved through
    rescission or repayment in full by the borrower. Although the
    timeline for resolution varies, once an actionable breach is
    identified on a given loan, settlement is generally reached as
    to that loan within 60 to 90 days. When a claim has been
    denied and the Corporation does not have communication with the
    counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims
    as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims
    balance until resolution.

On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP
    (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, in its capacity as
    servicer on 115 private-label securitizations, which was
    subsequently extended to 225 securitizations, received a letter
    that asserts breaches of certain servicing obligations,
    including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of
    representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans
    included in the transactions. Additionally, the Corporation
    received new claim demands totaling $1.7 billion in
    correspondence from private-label securitization investors.
    Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the
    contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the
    right to access loan files. The inclusion of the
    $1.7 billion in outstanding claims does not mean that the
    Corporation believes these claims have satisfied the contractual
    thresholds required for the private-label securitization
    investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or
    are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid.

Liability for
    Representations and Warranties and Corporate
    Guarantees  

The liability for representations and warranties and corporate
    guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities
    and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income.

The table below presents a rollforward of the liability for
    representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.

The liability for representations and warranties has been
    established when those obligations are both probable and
    reasonably estimable. As previously discussed, the Corporation
    reached agreements with the GSEs resolving repurchase claims
    involving certain residential mortgage loans sold to them by
    entities related to legacy Countrywide. The Corporation s
    liability for obligations under representations and warranties
    given to the GSEs considers the recent agreements and their
    impact on the repurchase rates on future claims that may be
    received on loans that have defaulted or that are estimated to
    default. The Corporation believes that its remaining exposure to
    repurchase obligations for first-lien residential mortgage loans
    sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for as a result of
    these agreements and the associated adjustments to the recorded
    liability for representations and

186        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

warranties for first-lien residential mortgage loans sold
    directly to the GSEs in 2010 and 2009, and for other loans sold
    directly to the GSEs and not covered by these agreements. The
    Corporation believes its predictive repurchase models, utilizing
    its historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while
    considering current developments, including the recent
    agreements, projections of future defaults, as well as certain
    assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other
    matters, allows it to reasonably estimate the liability for
    representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.
    However, future provisions for representations and warranties
    liability to the GSEs may be affected if actual experience is
    different from the Corporation s historical experience with
    the GSEs or the Corporation s projections of future
    defaults and assumptions regarding economic conditions, home
    prices and other matters that are incorporated in the provision
    calculation. Although experience with non-GSE claims remains
    limited, the Corporation expects additional activity in this
    area going forward and the volume of repurchase claims from
    monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in private-label
    securitizations could increase in the future. It is reasonably
    possible that future losses may occur and the Corporation s
    estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to
    non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over
    existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable
    loss, is based on currently available information, significant
    judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to
    change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans
    originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase
    liability is generally limited to the original seller of the
    loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may
    be impacted if actual results are different from the
    Corporation s assumptions regarding economic conditions,
    home prices and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The
    resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE
    counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and the
    Corporation will vigorously contest any request for repurchase
    if it concludes that a valid basis for repurchase claim does not
    exist.

NOTE 10  Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets   

Goodwill  

The table below presents goodwill balances by business segment
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009. As discussed in more detail
    in  Note 26   Business Segment Information,
     on January 1, 2010, the Corporation realigned the
    former  Global Banking  and  Global Markets  business
    segments. There was no impact on the reporting units used in
    goodwill impairment testing. The reporting units utilized for
    goodwill impairment tests are the business segments or one level
    below the business segments as outlined in the following table.
    Substantially all of the decline in goodwill in 2010 is the
    result of $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges, as
    described below. No goodwill impairment was recognized in 2009.
    The decline in  GWIM  was attributable to the sale of
    Columbia Management s long-term asset management business.

Global Card
    Services Impairment  

On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into
    law. Under the Financial Reform Act and its amendment to the
    Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve must
    adopt rules within nine months of enactment of the Financial
    Reform Act regarding the interchange fees that may be charged
    with respect to electronic debit transactions. Those rules will
    take effect one year after enactment of the Financial Reform
    Act. The Financial Reform Act and the applicable rules are
    expected to materially reduce the future revenues generated by
    the debit card business of the Corporation. The
    Corporation s consumer and small business card products,
    including the debit card business, are part of an integrated
    platform within  Global Card Services . During the three
    months ended September 30, 2010, the Corporation s
    estimate of revenue loss due to the Financial Reform Act was
    approximately $2.0 billion annually based on current
    volumes. Accordingly, the Corporation performed an impairment
    test for  Global Card Services  during the three months
    ended September 30, 2010.

In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of  Global
    Card Services  was estimated under the income approach where
    the significant assumptions included the discount rate, terminal
    value, expected loss rates and expected new account growth. The
    Corporation also updated its estimated cash flows to reflect the
    current strategic plan forecast and other portfolio assumptions.
    Based on the results of step one of the impairment test, the
    Corporation determined that the carrying amount of  Global
    Card Services , including goodwill, exceeded the fair value.
    The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the  Global
    Card Services  reporting unit were $39.2 billion,
    $25.9 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively.
    Accordingly, the Corporation performed step two of the goodwill
    impairment test for this reporting unit. In step two, the
    Corporation compared the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    Under step two of the impairment test, significant assumptions
    in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities
    including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were
    updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the
    results of this goodwill impairment test for  Global Card
    Services , the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the
    reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value by
    $10.4 billion. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded a
    non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $10.4 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in
     Global Card Services  from $22.3 billion to
    $11.9 billion. The goodwill impairment test included
    limited mitigation actions in  Global Card Services  to
    recapture lost revenue. Although the Corporation has identified
    other potential mitigation actions, the impact of these actions
    going forward did not reduce the goodwill impairment charge
    because these actions are in the early stages of development
    and, additionally, certain of them may impact segments other
    than  Global Card Services  (e.g ., Deposits ).

Due to the continued stress on  Global Card Services  as a
    result of the Financial Reform Act, the Corporation concluded
    that an additional impairment test should be performed for this
    reporting unit during the three months ended December 31,
    2010. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair
    value of  Global Card Services  was estimated under the
    income approach. The significant assumptions under the income
    approach included the discount rate, terminal value, expected
    loss rates and expected new account growth. The carrying amount,
    fair value and goodwill for the  Global Card Services
     reporting unit were $27.5 billion, $27.6 billion
    and $11.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value
    as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2010
    was 100 percent. Although the fair value exceeded the
    carrying amount in step one of the  Global Card Services
     goodwill impairment test, to further substantiate the value
    of goodwill, the Corporation also performed the step two test
    for this reporting unit. Under step two of the goodwill
    impairment test for this reporting unit, significant assumptions
    in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the
    reporting unit including discount rates, loss rates and interest
    rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions.
    The results of step two of the goodwill impairment test
    indicated that the remaining balance of goodwill of
    $11.9 billion was not impaired as of December 31, 2010.

On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed
    regulations to implement the Durbin Amendment of the Financial
    Reform Act, which are scheduled to be effective July 21,
    2011. The proposed regulations included two alternative
    interchange fee standards that would apply to all covered
    issuers: one based on each issuer s costs, with a safe
    harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap
    initially set at $0.12 per transaction, and the other a
    stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. Although
    the range of estimated revenue loss based on the proposed
    regulations was slightly higher than the Corporation s
    original estimate of $2.0 billion, given the uncertainty
    around the potential outcome, the Corporation did not change the
    revenue loss estimate used in the goodwill impairment test
    during the three months ended December 31, 2010. If the
    final Federal Reserve rule sets interchange fee standards that
    are significantly lower than the interchange fee assumptions the
    Corporation used in this goodwill impairment test, the
    Corporation will be required to perform an additional goodwill
    impairment test. If the final interchange fee standards are at
    the lowest proposed fee alternative, the Corporation s
    current estimate of the revenue loss could result in an
    additional goodwill impairment charge for  Global Card
    Services.  In view of the uncertainty with model inputs
    including the final ruling, changes in the economic outlook and
    the corresponding impact to revenues and asset quality, and the
    impacts of mitigation actions, it is not possible to estimate
    the amount or range of amounts of additional goodwill
    impairment, if any.

Home
    Loans   Insurance Impairment  

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation performed an impairment test for the  Home
    Loans   Insurance  reporting unit as it was likely
    that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of
    increased

uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation
    exposure and other potential risks, higher current servicing
    costs including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related
    issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to
    address servicing needs. In step one of the goodwill impairment
    test, the fair value of  Home Loans   Insurance
     was estimated based on a combination of the market approach
    and the income approach. Under the market approach valuation,
    significant assumptions included market multiples and a control
    premium. The significant assumptions for the valuation of
     Home Loans   Insurance  under the income
    approach included cash flow estimates, the discount rate and the
    terminal value. These assumptions were updated to reflect the
    current strategic plan forecast and to address the increased
    uncertainties referenced above. Based on the results of step one
    of the impairment test ,  the Corporation determined that
    the carrying amount of  Home Loans   Insurance ,
    including goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying
    amount, fair value and goodwill for the  Home
    Loans   Insurance  reporting unit were
    $24.7 billion, $15.1 billion and $4.8 billion,
    respectively. Accordingly, the Corporation performed step two of
    the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In step
    two, the Corporation compared the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that
    goodwill. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test,
    significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the
    assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount
    rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the
    current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of
    the impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned
    to  Home Loans   Insurance  exceeded the implied
    fair value by $2.0 billion. Accordingly, the Corporation
    recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment
    charge of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 to
    reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the  Home
    Loans   Insurance  reporting unit.

NOTE 13  Long-term
    Debt   

Long-term debt consists of borrowings having an original
    maturity of one year or more. The table below presents the
    balance of long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related contractual rates and maturity dates at
    December 31, 2010.

n/a = not applicable

At December 31, 2010, long-term debt of consolidated VIEs
    included credit card, automobile, home equity and other VIEs of
    $52.8 billion, $6.5 billion, $3.6 billion and
    $8.1 billion, respectively. Long-term debt of VIEs is
    collateralized by the assets of the VIEs. For more information,
    see  Note 8   Securitizations and Other
    Variable Interest Entities. 

The majority of the floating rates are based on three- and
    six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

Bank of America Corporation, Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc.
    and subsidiaries, and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various
    U.S. and
     non-U.S. debt 
    programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes
    may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of foreign
    currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars
    included in total long-term debt was $145.9 billion and
    $156.8 billion. Foreign currency contracts are used to
    convert certain foreign currency-denominated debt into
    U.S. dollars.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Bank of America Corporation
    had approximately $88.4 billion and $119.1 billion of
    authorized, but unissued, corporate debt and other securities
    under its existing U.S. shelf registration statements. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, Bank of America, N.A. had
    approximately $53.3 billion and $35.3 billion of
    authorized, but unissued, bank notes under its existing
    $75.0 billion bank note program. Long-term bank notes
    issued and outstanding under Bank of America, N.A. s
    $75.0 billion bank note program totaled $7.1 billion
    and $19.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At
    both December 31, 2010 and 2009, Bank of America, N.A. had
    approximately $20.6 billion of authorized, but unissued,
    mortgage notes under its $30.0 billion mortgage bond
    program.

The weighted-average effective interest rates for total
    long-term debt, excluding senior structured notes, total
    fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt, based on the rates
    in effect at December 31, 2010, were 3.96 percent,
    5.02 percent and 1.09 percent, respectively, at
    December 31, 2010 and,

190        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

based on the rates in effect at December 31, 2009, were
    3.62 percent, 4.93 percent and 0.80 percent,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009. The Corporation s
    ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management
    strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to
    manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate
    volatility. The Corporation s goal is to manage interest
    rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not
    significantly adversely affect net interest income. The above
    weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the
    debt, and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.

The weighted-average interest rate for debt, excluding senior
    structured notes, issued by Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc.
    and subsidiaries was 4.11 percent and 3.73 percent at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation has not assumed or guaranteed the
    $120.9 billion of long-term debt that was issued or
    guaranteed by Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. or its
    subsidiaries prior to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by the
    Corporation.

Beginning late in the third quarter of 2009, in connection with
    the update or renewal of certain Merrill Lynch
     non-U.S. securities 
    offering programs, the Corporation agreed to guarantee debt
    securities, warrants
     and/or 
    certificates issued by certain subsidiaries of Merrill
    Lynch   Co., Inc. on a going-forward basis. All
    existing Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc. guarantees of
    securities issued by those same Merrill Lynch subsidiaries under
    various
     non-U.S. securities 
    offering programs will remain in full force and effect as long
    as those securities are outstanding, and the Corporation has not
    assumed any of those prior Merrill Lynch   Co., Inc.
    guarantees or otherwise guaranteed such securities.

Certain senior structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch are
    accounted for under the fair value option. For more information
    on these senior structured notes, see
     Note 23   Fair Value Option. 

The table below represents the book value for aggregate annual
    maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2010.

Included in the above table are certain structured notes that
    contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the
    option of the holder (put options) at specified dates prior to
    maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms
    linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices,
    currencies or commodities and the maturity may be accelerated
    based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both
    cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle
    the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the
    contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the
    above table as maturing at their earliest put or redemption date.

Trust Preferred
    and Hybrid Securities  

Trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are issued by
    trust companies (the Trusts) that are not consolidated. These
    Trust Securities are mandatorily redeemable preferred
    security obligations of the Trusts. The sole assets of the
    Trusts generally are junior subordinated deferrable interest
    notes of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the Notes). The
    Trusts generally are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries
    of the Corporation. Obligations associated with the Notes are
    included in the long-term debt table on page 190.

Certain of the Trust Securities were issued at a discount
    and may be redeemed prior to maturity at the option of the
    Corporation. The Trusts generally have invested the proceeds of
    such Trust Securities in the Notes. Each issue of the Notes
    has an interest rate equal to the corresponding
    Trust Securities distribution rate. The Corporation has the
    right to defer payment of interest on the Notes at any time or
    from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided
    that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity
    of the relevant Notes. During any such extension period,
    distributions on the Trust Securities will also be deferred
    and the Corporation s ability to pay dividends on its
    common and preferred stock will be restricted.

The Trust Securities generally are subject to mandatory
    redemption upon repayment of the related Notes at their stated
    maturity dates or their earlier redemption at a redemption price
    equal to their liquidation amount plus accrued distributions to
    the date fixed for redemption and the premium, if any, paid by
    the Corporation upon concurrent repayment of the related Notes.

Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or
    redemption with respect to Trust Securities are guaranteed
    by the Corporation or its subsidiaries to the extent of funds
    held by the Trusts (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The
    Preferred Securities Guarantee, when taken together with the
    Corporation s other obligations including its obligations
    under the Notes, generally will constitute a full and
    unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, by the
    Corporation of payments due on the Trust Securities.

Hybrid Income Term Securities (HITS) totaling $1.6 billion
    were also issued by the Trusts to institutional investors in
    2007. The BAC Capital Trust XIII Floating-Rate Preferred
    HITS have a distribution rate of three-month LIBOR plus
    40 bps and the BAC Capital Trust XIV
     Fixed-to-Floating-Rate 
    Preferred HITS have an initial distribution rate of
    5.63 percent. Both series of HITS represent beneficial
    interests in the assets of the respective capital trust, which
    consist of a series of the Corporation s junior
    subordinated notes and a stock purchase contract for a specified
    series of the Corporation s preferred stock. The
    Corporation will remarket the junior subordinated notes
    underlying each series of HITS on or about the five-year
    anniversary of the issuance to obtain sufficient funds for the
    capital trusts to buy the Corporation s preferred stock
    under the stock purchase contracts.

In connection with the HITS, the Corporation entered into two
    replacement capital covenants for the benefit of investors in
    certain series of the Corporation s long-term indebtedness
    (Covered Debt). As of December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation s 6.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2036
    constitute the Covered Debt under the covenant corresponding to
    the Floating-Rate Preferred HITS and the Corporation s
    5.625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2035 constitute the Covered
    Debt under the covenant corresponding to the
     Fixed-to-Floating-Rate 
    Preferred HITS. These covenants generally restrict the ability
    of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to redeem or purchase
    the HITS and related securities unless the Corporation has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if required
    under the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines, the
    redemption or purchase price of the HITS does not exceed the
    amount received by the Corporation from the sale of certain
    qualifying securities, and such replacement securities qualify
    as Tier 1 Capital and are not  restricted core capital
    elements  under the Federal Reserve s guidelines.

NOTE 14  Commitments
    and Contingencies   

In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a
    number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments
    expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market
    risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk
    limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the
    Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Credit Extension
    Commitments  

The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as
    loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet
    the financing needs of its customers. The table below shows the
    notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments
    net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated) to other financial
    institutions of $23.3 billion and $30.9 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the
    carrying

amount of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for
    under the fair value option, was $1.2 billion, including
    deferred revenue of $29 million and a reserve for unfunded
    lending commitments of $1.2 billion. At December 31,
    2009, the comparable amounts were $1.5 billion,
    $34 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. The
    carrying amount of these commitments is classified in accrued
    expenses and other liabilities.

The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments
    of $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, that are accounted for under
    the fair value option. However, the table below excludes fair
    value adjustments of $866 million and $950 million on
    these commitments, which are classified in accrued expenses and
    other liabilities. For information regarding the
    Corporation s loan commitments accounted for under the fair
    value option, see  Note 23   Fair Value
    Option.

The notional amounts of SBLCs and
    financial guarantees classified as investment grade and
    non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the
    underlying reference name within the instrument were
    $41.1 billion and $22.4 billion at December 31,
    2010 and $39.7 billion and $30.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009.

Includes business card unused lines
    of credit.

Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have
    specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments
    have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation
    against deterioration in the borrower s ability to pay.

Other
    Commitments  

Global Principal
    Investments and Other Equity Investments  

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had unfunded
    equity investment commitments of approximately $1.5 billion
    and $2.8 billion. In light of proposed Basel regulatory
    capital changes related to unfunded

commitments, the Corporation has actively reduced these
    commitments in a series of transactions involving its private
    equity fund investments. For more information on these Basel
    regulatory capital changes, see
     Note 18   Regulatory Requirements and
    Restrictions . In 2010, the Corporation completed the sale of
    its exposure to certain private equity funds. For more
    information on these transactions, see
     Note 5   Securities . These
    commitments generally relate to the Corporation s Global
    Principal Investments business which is comprised of a
    diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real
    estate and other alternative investments. These investments are
    made either directly in a company or held through a fund.

Loan
    Purchases  

In 2005, the Corporation entered into an agreement for the
    committed purchase of retail automotive loans over a five-year
    period that ended on June 22, 2010. Under this agreement,
    the Corporation purchased $6.6 billion of such loans during
    the six months ended June 30, 2010 and also the year ended
    December 31, 2009. All loans purchased under this agreement
    were subject to a comprehensive set of credit criteria. This
    agreement was accounted for as a derivative liability with a
    fair value of $189 million at December 31, 2009. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Corporation was no longer committed
    for any additional purchases. As part of this agreement, the
    Corporation recorded a liability which may increase or decrease
    based on credit performance of the purchased loans over a period
    extending through 2016.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had other
    commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and
    commercial real estate) of $2.6 billion and
    $2.2 billion, which upon settlement will be included in
    loans or LHFS.

Operating
    Leases  

The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of
    its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are
    approximately $3.0 billion, $2.6 billion,
    $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion for
    2011 through 2015, respectively, and $6.6 billion in the
    aggregate for all years thereafter.

Other
    Commitments  

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had
    commitments to enter into forward-dated resale and securities
    borrowing agreements of $39.4 billion and
    $51.8 billion. In addition, the Corporation had commitments
    to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending
    agreements of $33.5 billion and $58.3 billion. All of
    these commitments expire within the next 12 months.

The Corporation has entered into agreements with providers of
    market data, communications, systems consulting and other
    office-related services. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    minimum fee commitments over the remaining terms of these
    agreements totaled $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion.

Other
    Guarantees  

Bank-owned Life
    Insurance Book Value Protection  

The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection
    to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to
    corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is
    provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade
    fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall
    in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and
    market value is

below book value. To manage its exposure, the Corporation
    imposes significant restrictions on surrenders and the manner in
    which the portfolio is liquidated and the funds are accessed. In
    addition, investment parameters of the underlying portfolio are
    restricted. These constraints, combined with structural
    protections, including a cap on the amount of risk assumed on
    each policy, are designed to provide adequate buffers and guard
    against payments even under extreme stress scenarios. These
    guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value
    in the trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    the notional amount of these guarantees totaled
    $15.8 billion and $15.6 billion and the
    Corporation s maximum exposure related to these guarantees
    totaled $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion with estimated
    maturity dates between 2030 and 2040. As of December 31,
    2010, the Corporation has not made a payment under these
    products. The probability of surrender has increased due to the
    deteriorating financial health of policyholders, but remains a
    small percentage of total notional.

Employee
    Retirement Protection  

The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection
    primarily to plan sponsors of Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governed pension plans, such as
    401(k) plans and 457 plans. The book value protection is
    provided on portfolios of intermediate/short-term
    investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to
    cover any shortfall in the event that plan participants continue
    to withdraw funds after all securities have been liquidated and
    there is remaining book value. The Corporation retains the
    option to exit the contract at any time. If the Corporation
    exercises its option, the purchaser can require the Corporation
    to purchase high quality fixed-income securities, typically
    government or government-backed agency securities, with the
    proceeds of the liquidated assets to assure the return of
    principal. To manage its exposure, the Corporation imposes
    significant restrictions and constraints on the timing of the
    withdrawals, the manner in which the portfolio is liquidated and
    the funds are accessed, and the investment parameters of the
    underlying portfolio. These constraints, combined with
    structural protections, are designed to provide adequate buffers
    and guard against payments even under extreme stress scenarios.
    These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair
    value in the trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled
    $33.8 billion and $36.8 billion with estimated
    maturity dates up to 2014 if the exit option is exercised on all
    deals. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has not
    made a payment under these products and has assessed the
    probability of payments under these guarantees as remote.

Indemnifications  

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into
    various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax
    indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain
    external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The
    indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and
    were entered into in the normal course of business based on an
    assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These
    agreements typically contain an early termination clause that
    permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events.
    The maximum potential future payment under indemnification
    agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including
    the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict
    future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in
    determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts,
    the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract
    language and the timing of the early termination clause.
    Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been
    de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of
    making such payments in the future as remote.

Merchant
    Services  

On June 26, 2009, the Corporation contributed its merchant
    processing business to a joint venture in exchange for a
    46.5 percent ownership interest in the joint venture.
    During the second quarter of 2010, the joint venture purchased
    the interest held by one of the three initial investors bringing
    the Corporation s ownership interest up to 49 percent.
    For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see
     Note 5   Securities .

The Corporation, on behalf of the joint venture, provides credit
    and debit card processing services to various merchants by
    processing credit and debit card transactions on the
    merchants  behalf. In connection with these services, a
    liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between
    the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the
    cardholder s favor and the merchant defaults on its
    obligation to reimburse the cardholder. A cardholder, through
    its issuing bank, generally has until the later of up to six
    months after the date a transaction is processed or the delivery
    of the product or service to present a chargeback to the joint
    venture as the merchant processor. If the joint venture is
    unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the
    loss for the amount paid to the cardholder. The joint venture is
    primarily liable for any losses on transactions from the
    contributed portfolio that occur after June 26, 2009.
    However, if the joint venture fails to meet its obligation to
    reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the
    Corporation could be held liable for the disputed amount. In
    2010 and 2009, the joint venture processed and settled
    $265.5 billion and $250.0 billion of transactions and
    it recorded losses of $17 million and $26 million.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation, on behalf
    of the joint venture, held as collateral $25 million and
    $26 million of merchant escrow deposits which may be used
    to offset amounts due from the individual merchants. The joint
    venture also has the right to offset any payments with cash
    flows otherwise due to the merchant. Accordingly, the
    Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not
    representative of the actual potential loss exposure. The
    Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for
    chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant
    transactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the last
    six months, which represents the claim period for the
    cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions.
    As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the maximum potential
    exposure totaled approximately $139.5 billion

and $131.0 billion. The Corporation does not expect to make
    material payments in connection with these guarantees. The
    maximum potential exposure disclosed does not include volumes
    processed by First Data contributed portfolios.

Other Derivative
    Contracts  

The Corporation funds selected assets, including securities
    issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically
    total return swaps, with third parties and SPEs that are not
    consolidated on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total notional
    amount of these derivative contracts was approximately
    $4.3 billion and $4.9 billion with commercial banks
    and $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion with SPEs. The
    underlying securities are senior securities and substantially
    all of the Corporation s exposures are insured.
    Accordingly, the Corporation s exposure to loss consists
    principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain
    circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the
    Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets,
    which would not result in additional gain or loss to the
    Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair
    value of the derivative contracts.

Other
    Guarantees  

The Corporation sells products that guarantee the return of
    principal to investors at a preset future date. These guarantees
    cover a broad range of underlying asset classes and are designed
    to cover the shortfall between the market value of the
    underlying portfolio and the principal amount on the preset
    future date. To manage its exposure, the Corporation requires
    that these guarantees be backed by structural and investment
    constraints and certain pre-defined triggers that would require
    the underlying assets or portfolio to be liquidated and invested
    in zero-coupon bonds that mature at the preset future date. The
    Corporation is required to fund any shortfall between the
    proceeds of the liquidated assets and the purchase price of the
    zero-coupon bonds at the preset future date. These guarantees
    are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the
    trading portfolio. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    notional amount of these guarantees totaled $666 million
    and $2.1 billion. These guarantees have various maturities
    ranging from two to five years. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the Corporation had not made a payment under these
    products and has assessed the probability of payments under
    these guarantees as remote.

The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements
    and commitments, including lease-end obligation agreements,
    partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint
    venture guarantees, sold risk participation swaps, divested
    business commitments and sold put options that require gross
    settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these
    agreements was approximately $3.4 billion and
    $3.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2033.
    The Corporation has made no material payments under these
    guarantees.

In addition, the Corporation has guaranteed the payment
    obligations of certain subsidiaries of Merrill Lynch on certain
    derivative transactions. The aggregate notional amount of such
    derivative liabilities was approximately $2.1 billion and
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. In the
    normal course of business, the Corporation periodically
    guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of
    transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non
    ISDA-related transactions such as commodities trading,
    repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other
    transactions.

Payment
    Protection Insurance Claims Matter  

In the U.K., the Corporation sells payment protection insurance
    (PPI) through its  Global Card Services  business to credit
    card customers and has previously sold this insurance to
    consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumer s loan or
    debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or
    illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints
    of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened
    media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the
    U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and
    raised concerns about the way some companies have handled
    complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In
    August 2010, the FSA issued a policy statement on the assessment
    and remediation of PPI claims which is applicable to the
    Corporation s U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to
    address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the
    handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The policy
    statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to
    current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or
    did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the
    insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to
    remedies. The FSA gave companies until December 1, 2010 to
    comply with the new regulations, but the judicial review to
    assess compliance is still underway. Given the new regulatory
    guidance, as of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a
    liability of $630 million based on its current claims
    history and an estimate of future claims that have yet to be
    asserted against the Corporation. The liability is included in
    accrued expenses and other liabilities and the related expense
    is included in insurance income. The policy statement also
    requires companies to review their sales practices and to
    proactively remediate non-complaining customers if evidence of a
    systematic breach of the newly articulated sales standards is
    discovered, which could include refunding premiums paid. Subject
    to the outcome of the Corporation s review and the new
    regulatory guidance, it is possible that an additional liability
    may be required. Industry groups have challenged the policy
    statement through a judicial review process. The judicial review
    is not expected to be completed until the end of the first
    quarter of 2011. Therefore, the Corporation is unable to
    reasonably estimate the total amount of additional possible loss
    or a range of loss as of December 31, 2010.

Litigation and
    Regulatory Matters  

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its
    subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many
    pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including
    actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These
    actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged
    violations of consumer protection, securities, environmental,
    banking, employment and other laws. In some of these actions and
    proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are
    asserted against the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its
    subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory examinations,
    information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations.
    Certain subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered
    broker/dealers or investment advisors and are subject to
    regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory
    Authority (FINRA), the New York Stock Exchange, the FSA and
    other domestic, international and state securities regulators.
    In connection with formal and informal inquiries by those
    agencies, such subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas
    and orders for documents, testimony and information in
    connection with various aspects of their regulated activities.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of
    such litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where the
    claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the
    matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number
    of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the
    eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing
    of

the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the
    eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter
    may be.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the
    Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and
    regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies
    that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may
    be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a
    loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the
    Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a
    litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in
    conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,
    evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a
    loss contingency that is probable and estimable. If, at the time
    of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or
    regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter
    will continue to be monitored for further developments that
    would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable.
    Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory
    matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the
    Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to
    such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of
    litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor
    the matter for further developments that could affect the amount
    of the accrued liability that has been previously established.
    Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers,
    litigation-related expense of $2.6 billion was recognized
    in 2010 compared to $1.0 billion for 2009.

For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for
    which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future
    periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or
    where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to
    estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is
    possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible
    loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material
    litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in
    conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in
    light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.
    These may include information learned through the discovery
    process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions,
    and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in
    which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate
    information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible
    loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may
    be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or
    reasonably possible but such an estimate may not be possible.
    For those matters where an estimate is possible, management
    currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is
    $145 million to $1.5 billion in excess of the accrued
    liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated
    range of possible loss is based upon currently available
    information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety
    of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters
    underlying the estimated range will change from time to time,
    and actual results may vary significantly from the current
    estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible
    are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, this
    estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation
    believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain
    matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the
    Corporation s maximum loss exposure. Information is
    provided below regarding the nature of all of these
    contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim
    associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current
    knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies
    arising from pending matters, including the matters described
    herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
    financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in
    light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters,
    some of which are beyond the Corporation s control, and the
    very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these
    matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters
    could be material to the Corporation s results of
    operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.

Auction Rate
    Securities Litigation  

Since October 2007, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and certain
    affiliates have been named as defendants in a variety of
    lawsuits and other proceedings brought by customers and both
    individual and institutional investors regarding ARS. These
    actions generally allege that the defendants: (i) misled
    the plaintiffs into believing that there was a deeply liquid
    market for ARS, and (ii) failed to adequately disclose
    their or their affiliates  practice of placing their own
    bids to support ARS auctions. Plaintiffs assert that ARS
    auctions started failing from August 2007 through February 2008
    when the defendants and other broker-dealers stopped placing
    those  support bids.  In addition to the matters
    described in more detail below, numerous arbitrations and
    individual lawsuits have been filed against the Corporation,
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates by parties who purchased
    ARS and are seeking relief that includes compensatory and
    punitive damages totaling in excess of $1.8 billion, as
    well as rescission, among other relief.

Securities
    Actions   

The Corporation and Merrill Lynch face a number of civil actions
    relating to the sales of ARS and management of ARS auctions,
    including two putative class action lawsuits in which the
    plaintiffs seek to recover the alleged losses in market value of
    ARS securities purportedly caused by the defendants 
    actions. Plaintiffs also seek unspecified damages, including
    rescission, other compensatory and consequential damages, costs,
    fees and interest. The first action,  In Re Merrill Lynch
    Auction Rate Securities Litigation , is the result of the
    consolidation of two separate class action suits in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
    These suits were brought by two customers of Merrill Lynch, on
    behalf of all persons who purchased ARS in auctions managed by
    Merrill Lynch, against Merrill Lynch and its subsidiary Merrill
    Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated (MLPFS). On
    March 31, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York granted Merrill Lynch s
    motion to dismiss. On April 22, 2010, a lead plaintiff
    filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Second Circuit, which is currently pending. The second
    action,  Bondar v. Bank of America Corporation , was
    brought by a putative class of ARS purchasers against the
    Corporation and Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS) and is
    currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of California. The Corporation and BAS have
    filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which remains
    pending.

Antitrust
    Actions   

The Corporation, Merrill Lynch and other financial institutions
    were also named in two putative antitrust class actions in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
    Plaintiffs in both actions assert federal antitrust claims under
    Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that
    defendants conspired to restrain trade in ARS by placing support
    bids in ARS auctions, only to collectively withdraw those bids
    in February 2008, which allegedly caused ARS auctions to fail.
    The plaintiff in the first action,  Mayor and City Council of
    Baltimore, Maryland v. Citigroup, Inc., et al. , seeks
    to represent a class of issuers of ARS that the defendants
    underwrote between May 12, 2003 and February 13, 2008.
    This issuer action seeks to recover, among other relief, the
    alleged above-market interest payments that ARS issuers
    allegedly have had to make after the defendants allegedly
    stopped placing  support bids  in ARS auctions. The
    plaintiff in the second action,  Mayfield, et al. v.
    Citigroup, Inc., et al. , seeks to represent a class of
    investors that purchased ARS from the defendants and held those
    securities when ARS auctions failed on February 13, 2008.
    Plaintiff seeks to recover, among other relief, unspecified
    damages for losses in the ARS  market value, and rescission
    of the investors  ARS purchases. Both actions also seek
    treble damages and attorneys  fees under the Sherman
    Act s private civil remedy. On January 25, 2010, the
    court dismissed both actions with prejudice and the

plaintiffs  respective appeals are currently pending in the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Checking Account
    Overdraft Litigation  

Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) is currently a defendant in several
    consumer suits challenging certain deposit account-related
    business practices. Three of the suits are presently part of a
    multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding involving
    approximately 65 individual cases against 30 financial
    institutions assigned by the Judicial Panel on Multi-district
    Litigation to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Florida. The three cases,  Tornes v. Bank of
    America, N.A., Yourke, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A., et
    al.  and  Knighten v. Bank of America, N.A. ,
    allege that BANA improperly and unfairly increased the number of
    overdraft fees it assessed on consumer deposit accounts by
    various means. The cases challenge the practice of reordering
    debit card transactions to post
     high-to-low 
    and BANA s failure to notify customers at the point of sale
    that the transaction may result in an overdraft charge. The
    cases also allege that BANA s disclosures and advertising
    regarding the posting of debit card transactions are false,
    deceptive and misleading. These cases assert claims including
    breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
    conversion, unjust enrichment and violation of the unfair and
    deceptive practices statutes of various states. Plaintiffs
    generally seek restitution of all overdraft fees paid to BANA as
    a result of BANA s allegedly wrongful business practices,
    as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, injunctive relief,
    pre-judgment interest and attorneys  fees. Omnibus motions
    to dismiss many of the complaints involved in the MDL, including
     Tornes, Yourke  and  Knighten , were denied on
    March 12, 2010. Trial is currently scheduled for
    March 26, 2012. A fourth putative class action,
     Phillips, et al. v. Bank of America, N.A. , which
    includes similar allegations, will shortly become part of the
    MDL proceedings.

In December 2004, BANA was also named as the defendant in
     Closson, et al. v. Bank of America, et al. , a
    putative class action currently pending in the California Court
    of Appeal, First District, Division 1, which also
    challenges BANA s practice of reordering debit card
    transactions to post deposits in
     high-to-low 
    order.  Closson  asserts claims for violations of
    California state law, and seeks restitution, disgorgement,
    actual and punitive damages, a corrective advertising campaign
    and injunctive relief. BANA entered into a settlement in
     Closson , which received final approval by the Superior
    Court of the State of California for the County of
    San Francisco on August 3, 2009. The settlement
    provides for a $35 million payment by BANA in exchange for
    a release of the claims against BANA by the members of the
    nationwide settlement class. Several settlement class members
    who objected to the final approval of the settlement have
    appealed. If the  Closson  settlement is affirmed, it will
    likely bar the claims of many of the putative class members in
     Tornes, Yourke  and  Knighten , as many of those
    class members are covered by the putative class in
     Closson .

On January 27, 2011, the Corporation reached a settlement
    in principle with the lead plaintiffs in the MDL, subject to
    complete final documentation and court approvals. The settlement
    will provide for a payment by the Corporation of
    $410 million (which amount was fully accrued by the
    Corporation as of December 31, 2010) in exchange for a
    complete release of claims asserted against the Corporation in
    the MDL. The settlement also contemplates that a stay will be
    requested in the  Closson  appeal and that, when this
    settlement becomes effective, the appeal in  Closson  will
    be withdrawn and the settlement in  Closson  will be
    effectuated according to its terms.

Countrywide Bond
    Insurance Litigation  

The Corporation, Countrywide Financial Corporation (CFC) and
    various other Countrywide entities are subject to claims from
    several monoline bond insurance companies. These claims
    generally relate to bond insurance policies provided by the
    insurers on certain securitized pools of home equity lines

Bank of America
    2010        197  

Table of Contents   

of credit and fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. Plaintiffs
    in these cases generally allege that they have paid claims as a
    result of defaults in the underlying loans and assert that these
    defaults are the result of improper underwriting by the
    defendants.

MBIA   

The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are
    named as defendants in two actions filed by MBIA Insurance
    Corporation (MBIA). The first action,  MBIA Insurance
    Corporation, Inc. v. Countrywide Home Loans, et al. , is
    pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County. In
    April 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the
    Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss and denied the
    Corporation s motion to dismiss. The parties have filed
    cross-appeals from this order. On December 22, 2010, the
    court issued an order on MBIA s motion for use of sampling
    at trial, in which the court held that MBIA may attempt to prove
    its breach of contract and fraudulent inducement claims through
    examination of statistically significant samples of the
    securitizations at issue. In its order, the court did not
    endorse any of MBIA s specific sampling proposals and
    stated that defendants have  significant valid
    challenges  to MBIA s methodology that they may
    present at trial, together with defendants  own views and
    evidence.

The second MBIA action,  MBIA Insurance Corporation,
    Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation, Countrywide Financial
    Corporation, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Countrywide
    Securities Corporation, et al. , is pending in the Superior
    Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. MBIA
    purports to bring this action as subrogee to the note holders
    for certain securitized pools of home equity lines of credit and
    fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and seeks unspecified
    damages and declaratory relief. On May 17, 2010, the court
    dismissed the claims against the Countrywide defendants with
    leave to amend, but denied the request to dismiss MBIA s
    successor liability claims against the Corporation. On
    June 21, 2010, MBIA filed an amended complaint re-asserting
    its previously dismissed claims against the Countrywide
    defendants, re-asserting the successor liability claim against
    the Corporation and adding Countrywide Capital Markets, LLC as a
    defendant. The Countrywide defendants filed a demurrer to the
    amended complaint, but the court declined to rule on the
    demurrer and instead entered an order which stays this case
    until August 1, 2011.

Syncora   

The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are
    named as defendants in an action filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc.
    (Syncora) entitled  Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. Countrywide
    Home Loans, Inc., et al.  This action, currently pending in
    New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to bond
    insurance policies provided by Syncora on certain securitized
    pools of home equity lines of credit. In March 2010, the court
    issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the
    Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss. Syncora and the
    Countrywide defendants have filed cross-appeals from this order.
    In May 2010, Syncora amended its complaint. Defendants filed an
    answer to Syncora s amended complaint on July 9, 2010,
    as well as a counterclaim for breach of contract and declaratory
    judgment. The parties have agreed to stay the counterclaim until
    August 15, 2011.

FGIC   

The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are
    named as defendants in an action filed by Financial Guaranty
    Insurance Company (FGIC) entitled  Financial Guaranty
    Insurance Co. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc . This
    action, currently pending in New York Supreme Court, New York
    County, relates to bond insurance policies provided by FGIC on
    certain securitized pools of home equity lines of credit and
    fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans. In June 2010, the court
    entered an order that granted in part and denied in part the
    Countrywide defendants  motion to dismiss. FGIC and the

Countrywide defendants have filed cross-appeals from this order.
    Defendants filed an answer to FGIC s amended complaint on
    July 19, 2010. On March 24, 2010, CFC and certain
    other Countrywide entities filed a separate but related action
    against FGIC in New York Supreme Court seeking monetary damages
    of at least $100 million against FGIC in connection with
    FGIC s failure to pay claims under certain bond insurance
    policies.

Ambac   

The Corporation, CFC and various other Countrywide entities are
    named as defendants in an action filed by Ambac Assurance
    Corporation (Ambac) entitled  Ambac Assurance Corporation and
    The Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation v.
    Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., et al.  This action, currently
    pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, relates to
    bond insurance policies provided by Ambac on certain securitized
    pools of home equity lines of credit and fixed-rate second-lien
    mortgage loans. On December 10, 2010, defendants filed
    answers to the complaint.

Countrywide
    Equity and Debt Securities Matters  

Certain New York state and municipal pension funds have
    commenced litigation in the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California, entitled  In re Countrywide
    Financial Corporation Securities Litigation , against CFC,
    certain other Countrywide entities and several former CFC
    officers and directors. This action alleges violations of the
    antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
    Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.
    Plaintiffs claim losses in excess of $25.0 billion that
    plaintiffs allegedly experienced on certain CFC equity and debt
    securities. Plaintiffs also assert additional claims against
    BAS, MLPFS and other underwriter defendants under
    Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.
    Plaintiffs  allege that CFC made false and misleading
    statements in certain SEC filings and elsewhere concerning the
    nature and quality of its loan underwriting practices and its
    financial results. On April 2, 2010, the parties reached an
    agreement in principle to settle this action for
    $624 million in exchange for a dismissal of all claims with
    prejudice. On August 2, 2010, the court preliminarily
    approved the settlement. On December 1, 2010, CFC and the
    plaintiffs agreed to amend the settlement to allow CFC to use up
    to $22.5 million of the settlement funds for a two-year
    period following final approval of the settlement to resolve any
    claims asserted by investors who chose to exclude themselves
    from the class. On January 7, 2011, the court preliminarily
    approved this amendment. The settlement remains subject to final
    court approval.

Interchange and
    Related Litigation  

A group of merchants have filed a series of putative class
    actions and individual actions with regard to interchange fees
    associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions.
    These actions, which have been consolidated in the
    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York
    under the caption  In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
    Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation
     ( Interchange ), name Visa, MasterCard and several
    banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation, as
    defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to
    fix the level of default interchange rates, which represent the
    fee an issuing bank charges an acquiring bank on every
    transaction. Plaintiffs also challenge as unreasonable
    restraints of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act
    certain rules of Visa and MasterCard related to merchant
    acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale. Plaintiffs
    seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on their
    assertion that interchange would be lower or eliminated absent
    the alleged conduct. On January 8, 2008, the court granted
    defendants  motion to dismiss all claims for pre-2004
    damages. Motions to dismiss the remainder of the complaint and
    plaintiffs  motion for class certification are pending.

In addition, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints against
    certain defendants, including the Corporation, relating to
    initial public offerings (the

198        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

IPOs) of MasterCard and Visa. Plaintiffs allege that the
    MasterCard and Visa IPOs violated Section 7 of the Clayton
    Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs also
    assert that the MasterCard IPO was a fraudulent conveyance.
    Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and to undo the IPOs.
    Motions to dismiss both supplemental complaints remain pending.

The Corporation and certain of its affiliates previously entered
    into loss-sharing agreements with Visa and other financial
    institutions in connection with certain antitrust litigation
    against Visa, including  Interchange . The Corporation and
    these same affiliates have now entered into additional
    loss-sharing agreements for  Interchange  that cover all
    defendants, including MasterCard. Collectively, the loss-sharing
    agreements require the Corporation
     and/or 
    certain affiliates to pay 11.6 percent of the monetary
    portion of any comprehensive  Interchange  settlement. In
    the event of an adverse judgment, the agreements require the
    Corporation
     and/or 
    certain affiliates to pay 12.8 percent of any damages
    associated with Visa-related claims (Visa-related damages),
    9.1 percent of any damages associated with
    MasterCard-related claims, and 11.6 percent of any damages
    associated with internetwork claims (internetwork damages) or
    not associated specifically with Visa or MasterCard-related
    claims (unassigned damages).

Pursuant to Visa s publicly-disclosed Retrospective
    Responsibility Plan (the RRP), Visa placed certain proceeds from
    its IPO into an escrow fund (the Escrow). Under the RRP, funds
    in the Escrow may be accessed by Visa and its members, including
    Bank of America, to pay for a comprehensive settlement or
    damages in  Interchange , with the Corporation s
    payments from the Escrow capped at 12.81 percent of the
    funds that Visa places therein. Subject to that cap, the
    Corporation may use Escrow funds to cover: 66.7 percent of
    its monetary payment towards a comprehensive  Interchange
     settlement, 100 percent of its payment for any
    Visa-related damages and 66.7 percent of its payment for
    any internetwork and unassigned damages.

In re Initial
    Public Offering Securities Litigation  

BAS, Merrill Lynch, MLPFS, and certain of their subsidiaries,
    along with other underwriters, and various issuers and others,
    were named as defendants in a number of putative class action
    lawsuits that have been consolidated in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of New York as  In re Initial
    Public Offering Securities Litigation.  Plaintiffs contend,
    among other things, that defendants failed to make certain
    required disclosures in the registration statements and
    prospectuses for applicable offerings regarding alleged
    agreements with institutional investors that tied allocations in
    certain offerings to the purchase orders by those investors in
    the aftermarket. Plaintiffs allege that such agreements allowed
    defendants to manipulate the price of the securities sold in
    these offerings in violation of Section 11 of the
    Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. The
    parties agreed to settle the matter, for which the court granted
    final approval. Some putative class members have filed an
    appeal, which remains pending, in the U.S. Court of Appeals
    for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the final approval.

Lehman Brothers
    Holdings, Inc. Litigation  

Beginning in September 2008, BAS, MLPFS, Countrywide Securities
    Corporation (CSC) and LaSalle Financial Services Inc., along
    with other underwriters and individuals, were named as
    defendants in several putative class action lawsuits filed in
    federal and state courts. All of these cases have since been
    transferred or conditionally transferred to the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    under the caption  In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA
    Litigation . Plaintiffs allege that the underwriter
    defendants violated Section 11 of the Securities Act of
    1933, as well as various state laws, by making false or
    misleading disclosures about the real estate-related investments
    and mortgage lending practices of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.
    (LBHI) in connection with various debt and convertible stock

offerings of LBHI. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages. On
    June 4, 2010, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
    complaint, which remains pending.

Lehman Setoff
    Litigation  

In 2008, following the bankruptcy filing of LBHI, Lehman
    Brothers Special Financing Inc. (LBSF) owed money to BANA as a
    result of various terminated derivatives transactions entered
    into pursuant to one or more ISDA Master Agreements between the
    parties. The net termination values of these derivative
    transactions resulted in estimated claims by BANA against LBSF
    in excess of $1.0 billion. LBHI had guaranteed this
    exposure and, as part of an arrangement through which various
    LBHI subsidiaries and affiliates would retain an ability to
    overdraw their accounts during working hours, had
    $500 million in cash (plus $1.8 million in accrued
    interest) on deposit with BANA in a deposit account (the Deposit
    Account).

On November 10, 2008, BANA exercised its right of setoff
    against the Deposit Account to partially satisfy claims that
    BANA had asserted against LBSF and LBHI pursuant to the ISDA
    agreements and the LBHI guarantee. At the same time, BANA
    exercised its right of set off against five other LBHI accounts
    holding an additional $7.5 million (one of which, in the
    amount of approximately $500,000, was later reversed). On
    November 26, 2008, BANA commenced an adversary proceeding
    against LBSF and LBHI in their Chapter 11 bankruptcy
    proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
    District of New York. BANA sought a declaration that its setoff
    of LBHI s funds was proper and not in violation of the
    automatic stay imposed under the Bankruptcy Code. In response,
    LBHI filed counterclaims against BANA alleging that BANA had no
    right to set off against the $502 million held in the
    Deposit Account, and that the entire setoff was in violation of
    the automatic stay. LBHI sought the return of the set-off funds
    plus prejudgment interest and unspecified damages for violation
    of the automatic stay, including attorneys  fees and
    interest. LBSF and LBHI also argued in their summary judgment
    papers that the entire setoff was in violation of the automatic
    stay, although they did not plead turnover of the funds held in
    the other accounts.

On December 3, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered summary
    judgment against BANA with respect to setoff of the Deposit
    Account and directed BANA to pay to LBSF and LBHI
    $502 million, plus interest at nine percent per annum from
    November 10, 2008 through the date of the judgment. The
    court conducted a status conference on January 19, 2011 and
    directed the parties to discuss and present a further order
    regarding LBHI s request for sanctions pertaining to
    BANA s alleged violation of the automatic stay. LBSF and
    LBHI publicly indicated that they would request turnover of the
    $7 million that was set off from the other accounts plus an
    additional amount to account for changes in foreign exchange
    rates. The parties have since agreed in principle to settle both
    the sanctions issue and the question of turnover of the
    additional $7 million for an irrevocable payment of
    $1.5 million by BANA. The settlement, which has still to be
    finally documented and is subject to approval of the Bankruptcy
    Court, would express that BANA admits no liability or wrongdoing
    with respect to sanctions, and that LBHI and LBSF reserve no
    rights to seek recovery of the $7 million, on appeal or
    otherwise. BANA will oppose that request. BANA has preserved its
    appellate rights as to the December 3 order and intends to file
    an appeal upon entry of a final order approving the settlement.

MBIA Insurance
    Corporation CDO Litigation  

On April 30, 2009, MBIA and LaCrosse Financial Products,
    LLC filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court, New York
    County, against MLPFS and Merrill Lynch International
    (MLI) under the caption  MBIA Insurance Corporation and
    LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC v. Merrill Lynch Pierce
    Fenner and Smith Inc. ,  and Merrill Lynch International.
     The complaint relates to certain credit default swap and
    insurance agreements by which plaintiffs provided credit
    protection to MLPFS and MLI and other parties on CDO

Bank of America
    2010        199  

Table of Contents   

securities. Plaintiffs claim that MLPFS and MLI did not
    adequately disclose the credit quality and other risks of the
    CDO securities and underlying collateral. The complaint alleges
    claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the
    implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of
    contract and seeks rescission and unspecified compensatory and
    punitive damages, among other relief. On April 9, 2010, the
    court granted defendants  motion to dismiss as to the
    fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the implied
    covenant of good faith and fair dealing and rescission claims,
    as well as a portion of the breach of contract claim. Plaintiffs
    have appealed the dismissal of their claims and MLI has
    cross-appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss the breach of
    contract claim in its entirety. On February 1, 2011, the
    appellate court dismissed the case against MLI in its entirety.
    MBIA has filed a request to appeal the appellate court s
    decision to the New York State Court of Appeals and has
    requested permission from the trial court to file an amended
    complaint.

Merrill Lynch
    Acquisition-related Matters  

Since January 2009, the Corporation and certain of its current
    and former officers and directors, among others, have been named
    as defendants in a variety of actions filed in state and federal
    courts relating to the Corporation s acquisition of Merrill
    Lynch (the Acquisition). These acquisition-related cases consist
    of securities actions, derivative actions and actions under
    ERISA. The claims in these actions generally concern
    (i) the Acquisition; (ii) the financial condition and
    2008 fourth-quarter losses experienced by the Corporation and
    Merrill Lynch; (iii) due diligence conducted in connection
    with the Acquisition; (iv) the Corporation s agreement
    that Merrill Lynch could pay up to $5.8 billion in bonus
    payments to Merrill Lynch employees; (v) the
    Corporation s discussions with government officials in
    December 2008 regarding the Corporation s consideration of
    invoking the material adverse change clause in the Acquisition
    agreement and the possibility of obtaining government assistance
    in completing the Acquisition;
     and/or 
    (vi) alleged material misrepresentations
     and/or 
    material omissions in the proxy statement and related materials
    for the Acquisition.

Securities
    Actions   

Plaintiffs in the putative securities class actions in the  In
    re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment
    Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
     (Securities Plaintiffs) represent all (i) purchasers of
    the Corporation s common and preferred securities between
    September 15, 2008 and January 21, 2009;
    (ii) holders of the Corporation s common stock or
    Series B Preferred Stock as of October 10, 2008; and
    (iii) purchasers of the Corporation s common stock
    issued in the offering that occurred on or about October 7,
    2008. During the purported class period, the Corporation had
    between 4,560,112,687 and 5,017,579,321 common shares
    outstanding and the price of those securities declined from
    $33.74 on September 12, 2008 to $6.68 on January 21,
    2009. Securities Plaintiffs claim violations of
    Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Securities
    Plaintiffs  amended complaint also alleges violations of
    Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933
    related to an offering of the Corporation s common stock
    that occurred on or about October 7, 2008, and names BAS
    and MLPFS, among others, as defendants on the Section 11
    and 12(a)(2) claims. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed
    motions to dismiss, which the court granted in part by
    dismissing certain of the Securities Plaintiffs  claims
    under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    Securities Plaintiffs have filed a second amended complaint
    which seeks to replead some of the dismissed claims as well as
    add claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of holders of certain debt,
    preferred securities and option securities. The Corporation and
    its co-defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the second
    amended complaint s new and amended

allegations, which remains pending. Securities Plaintiffs seek
    unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys 
    fees.

Several individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue claims apart
    from the  In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative, and
    Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation 
    and, accordingly, have initiated individual actions relying on
    substantially the same facts and claims as the Securities
    Plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York.

On January 13, 2010, the Corporation, Merrill Lynch and
    certain of the Corporation s current and former officers
    and directors were named in a purported class action filed in
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York entitled  Dornfest v. Bank of America Corp., et
    al . The action is purportedly brought on behalf of investors
    in Corporation option contracts between September 15, 2008
    and January 22, 2009 and alleges that during the class
    period approximately 9.5 million Corporation call option
    contracts and approximately eight million Corporation put option
    contracts were already traded on seven of the Options Clearing
    Corporation exchanges. The complaint alleges that defendants
    violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC rules promulgated thereunder. On
    April 9, 2010, the court consolidated this action with the
    consolidated securities action in the  In re Bank of America
    Securities, Derivative and Employment Retirement Income Security
    Act (ERISA) Litigation , and ruled that the plaintiffs may
    pursue the action as an individual action. Plaintiffs seek
    unspecified monetary damages, legal costs and attorneys 
    fees.

Derivative
    Actions   

Several of the derivative actions related to the Acquisition
    that were pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery were
    consolidated under the caption  In re Bank of America
    Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In addition,
    the MDL ordered the transfer of actions related to the
    Acquisition that had been pending in various federal courts to
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These
    actions have been separately consolidated and are now pending
    under the caption  In re Bank of America Securities,
    Derivative, and Employment Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) Litigation. 

On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the derivative actions in
    the  In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and
    Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation
     (the Derivative Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended
    derivative and class action complaint. The amended complaint
    names as defendants certain of the Corporation s current
    and former directors, officers and financial advisors, and
    certain of Merrill Lynch s current and former directors and
    officers. The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant with
    respect to the derivative claims. The amended complaint asserts
    claims for, among other things: (i) violation of federal
    securities laws; (ii) breach of fiduciary duties;
    (iii) the return of incentive compensation that is alleged
    to be inappropriate in view of the work performed and the
    results achieved by certain of the defendants; and
    (iv) contribution in connection with the Corporation s
    exposure to significant liability under state and federal law.
    The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,
    equitable remedies and other relief. On February 8, 2010,
    the Derivative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims
    against each of the former Merrill Lynch officers and directors
    without prejudice. The Corporation and its co-defendants filed
    motions to dismiss, which were granted in part on
    August 27, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the Corporation
    and its co-defendants answered the remaining allegations
    asserted by the Derivative Plaintiffs.

On February 17, 2010, an alleged shareholder of the
    Corporation filed a purported derivative action, entitled
     Bahnmaier v. Lewis, et al. , in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
    The complaint names as defendants certain of the
    Corporation s current and former directors and officers,
    and one of Merrill Lynch s former officers. The complaint
    alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants
    breached their fiduciary

200        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

duties by failing to provide accurate and complete information
    to shareholders regarding: (i) certain Acquisition-related
    events; (ii) the potential for litigation resulting from
    Countrywide s lending practices; and (iii) the risk
    posed to the Corporation s capital levels as a result of
    Countrywide s loan losses. The complaint also asserts
    claims against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary
    duty by failing to maintain adequate internal controls, unjust
    enrichment, abuse of control and gross mismanagement in
    connection with the supervision and management of the
    operations, business and disclosure controls of the Corporation.
    The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant only and no
    monetary relief is sought against it. The complaint seeks, among
    other things, unspecified monetary damages, equitable remedies
    and other relief. On December 14, 2010, the court entered
    an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice.

The Corporation and certain of its current and former directors
    are also named as defendants in several putative class and
    derivative actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery, including
     Rothbaum v. Lewis ;  Southeastern Pennsylvania
    Transportation Authority v. Lewis; Tremont Partners
    LLC v. Lewis; Kovacs v. Lewis; Stern v.
    Lewis ; and  Houx v. Lewis , brought by
    shareholders alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of
    corporate assets in connection with the Acquisition. On
    April 27, 2009, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated
    the derivative actions under the caption  In re Bank of
    America Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The
    complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary
    damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On April 30,
    2009, the putative class claims in the  Stern v. Lewis
     and  Houx v. Lewis  actions were voluntarily
    dismissed without prejudice. Trial is scheduled for October 2012.

ERISA
    Actions   

On October 9, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA actions in the
     In re Bank of America Securities, Derivative and Employment
    Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation  (the ERISA
    Plaintiffs) filed a consolidated amended complaint for breaches
    of duty under ERISA. The amended complaint is brought on behalf
    of a purported class that consists of participants in the
    Corporation s 401(k) Plan, the Corporation s 401(k)
    Plan for Legacy Companies, the CFC 401(k) Plan (collectively,
    the 401(k) Plans) and the Corporation s Pension Plan. The
    amended complaint alleges violations of ERISA, based on, among
    other things: (i) an alleged failure to prudently and
    loyally manage the 401(k) Plans and Pension Plan by continuing
    to offer the Corporation s common stock as an investment
    option or measure for participant contributions; (ii) an
    alleged failure to monitor the fiduciaries of the 401(k) Plans
    and Pension Plan; (iii) an alleged failure to provide
    complete and accurate information to the 401(k) Plans and
    Pension Plan participants with respect to the Merrill Lynch and
    Countrywide acquisitions and related matters; and
    (iv) alleged co-fiduciary liability for these purported
    fiduciary breaches. The amended complaint seeks unspecified
    monetary damages, equitable remedies and other relief. On
    August 27, 2010, the court dismissed the complaint brought
    by plaintiffs in the consolidated ERISA action in its entirety.
    The ERISA Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the
    court s dismissal of their actions. The parties then
    stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal with the agreement
    that the ERISA Plaintiffs can reinstate their appeal at any time
    up until July 27, 2011.

On February 4, 2010, the New York Attorney General (NYAG)
    filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of New York State,
    entitled  People of the State of New York v. Bank of
    America, et al . The complaint names as defendants the
    Corporation and the Corporation s former CEO and CFO, and
    alleges violations of Sections 352, 352-c(1)(a),
    352-c(1)(c), and 353 of the New York General Business Law,
    commonly known as the Martin Act, and Section 63(12) of the
    New York Executive Law. The complaint seeks an

unspecified amount in disgorgement, penalties, restitution, and
    damages and other equitable relief. The court has ordered fact
    discovery to be complete by September 30, 2011.

Montgomery  

The Corporation, several of its current and former officers and
    directors, BAS, MLPFS and other unaffiliated underwriters have
    been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    entitled  Montgomery v. Bank of America, et al .
    Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 14, 2011.
    Plaintiff seeks to sue on behalf of all persons who acquired
    certain series of preferred stock offered by the Corporation
    pursuant to a shelf registration statement dated May 5,
    2006. Plaintiff s claims arise from three offerings dated
    January 24, 2008, January 28, 2008 and May 20,
    2008, from which the Corporation allegedly received proceeds of
    $15.8 billion. The amended complaint asserts claims under
    Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,
    and alleges that the prospectus supplements associated with the
    offerings: (i) failed to disclose that the
    Corporation s loans, leases, CDOs and commercial MBS were
    impaired to a greater extent than disclosed;
    (ii) misrepresented the extent of the impaired assets by
    failing to establish adequate reserves or properly record losses
    for its impaired assets; (iii) misrepresented the adequacy
    of the Corporation s internal controls in light of the
    alleged impairment of its assets; (iv) misrepresented the
    Corporation s capital base and Tier 1 leverage ratio
    for risk-based capital in light of the allegedly impaired
    assets; and (v) misrepresented the thoroughness and
    adequacy of the Corporation s due diligence in connection
    with its acquisition of Countrywide. The amended complaint seeks
    rescission, compensatory and other damages.

Mortgage-backed
    Securities Litigation  

The Corporation and its affiliates, Countrywide entities and
    their affiliates, and Merrill Lynch entities and their
    affiliates have been named as defendants in several cases
    relating to their various roles as issuer, originator, seller,
    depositor, sponsor, underwriter
     and/or 
    controlling entity in MBS offerings, pursuant to which the MBS
    investors were entitled to a portion of the cash flow from the
    underlying pools of mortgages. These cases generally include
    purported class action suits and actions by individual MBS
    purchasers. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these
    cases generally allege that the registration statements,
    prospectuses and prospectus supplements for securities issued by
    securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and
    omissions, in violation of Sections 11 and 12 of the
    Securities Act of 1933
     and/or  state
    securities laws and other state statutory and common laws.

These cases generally involve allegations of false and
    misleading statements regarding: (i) the process by which
    the properties that served as collateral for the mortgage loans
    underlying the MBS were appraised; (ii) the percentage of
    equity that mortgage borrowers had in their homes;
    (iii) the borrowers  ability to repay their mortgage
    loans; and (iv) the underwriting practices by which those
    mortgage loans were originated (collectively, the MBS Claims).
    In addition, several of the cases discussed below assert claims
    related to the ratings given to the different tranches of MBS by
    rating agencies. Plaintiffs in these cases generally seek
    unspecified compensatory damages, unspecified costs and legal
    fees and, in some instances, seek rescission.

Luther
    Litigation and Related Actions   

David H. Luther and various pension funds (collectively, Luther
    Plaintiffs) commenced a putative class action against CFC,
    several of its affiliates, BAS, MLPFS and other entities and
    individuals in California Superior Court for Los Angeles County
    entitled  Luther v. Countrywide Financial Corporation,
    et al  (the Luther Action). The Luther Plaintiffs claim
    that they and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued
    by subsidiaries of CFC in 429 offerings

Bank of America
    2010        201  

Table of Contents   

between January 2005 and December 2007. The Luther Plaintiffs
    certified that they collectively purchased securities in 61 of
    the 429 offerings for approximately $216 million. On
    January 6, 2010, the court granted CFC s motion to
    dismiss, with prejudice, due to lack of subject matter
    jurisdiction. The Luther Plaintiffs  appeal to the
    California Court of Appeal is currently pending.

Following the dismissal of the Luther Action, the Maine State
    Retirement System filed a putative class action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,
    entitled  Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide
    Financial Corporation, et al.  (the Maine Action). The Maine
    Action names the same defendants as the Luther Action, as well
    as the Corporation and NB Holdings Corporation, and asserts
    substantially the same allegations regarding 427 of the MBS
    offerings that were at issue in the Luther Action. On
    May 14, 2010, the court appointed the Iowa Public
    Employees  Retirement System (IPERS) as Lead Plaintiff. On
    July 13, 2010, IPERS filed an amended complaint, which
    added additional pension fund plaintiffs (collectively, the
    Maine Plaintiffs). The Maine Plaintiffs certified that they
    purchased securities in 81 of those 427 offerings, for
    approximately $538 million. On November 4, 2010, the
    court granted CFC s motion to dismiss the amended complaint
    in its entirety, and ordered the Maine Plaintiffs to file a
    second amended complaint within 30 days. In so doing, the
    court held that the Maine Plaintiffs only have standing to sue
    over the 81 offerings in which they actually purchased MBS. The
    court also held that the applicable statute of limitations could
    be tolled by the filing of the Luther Action only with respect
    to the offerings in which the Luther Plaintiffs actually
    purchased MBS. On December 6, 2010, the Maine Plaintiffs
    filed a second amended complaint that relates to 14 MBS
    offerings.

Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund (Western
    Teamsters) filed suit against the same defendants named in the
    Maine Action on November 17, 2010 in the Superior Court of
    California, Los Angeles County, entitled  Western Conference
    of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. Countrywide
    Financial Corporation, et al . Western Teamsters claims that
    it and other unspecified investors purchased MBS issued in the
    428 offerings that were also at issue in the Luther Action. The
    Western Teamsters action has been stayed by the Superior Court
    pending resolution of the appeal of the Luther Action.

The New Mexico State Investment Council, New Mexico Educational
    Retirement Board and New Mexico Public Employees Retirement
    Association (the New Mexico Plaintiffs) have also brought an
    action against CFC and several of its affiliates, current and
    former officers, as well as third-party underwriters in New
    Mexico District Court for the County of Santa Fe, entitled
     New Mexico State Investment Council, et al. v.
    Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al . A related action
    was later filed against the individual defendants in California
    Superior Court, entitled  New Mexico State Investment Council,
    et al. v. Stanford L. Kurland, et al.  On
    November 15, 2010, the parties agreed to resolve and
    dismiss these two cases in their entirety with prejudice for an
    amount that is not material to the Corporation s results of
    operations.

Putnam Bank filed a putative class action lawsuit on
    January 27, 2011 against CFC, the Corporation, certain of
    their subsidiaries, and certain individuals in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut,
    entitled  Putnam Bank v. Countrywide Financial
    Corporation, et al . Putnam Bank alleges that it purchased
    approximately $33 million in eight MBS offerings issued by
    subsidiaries of CFC between August 2005 and September 2007. All
    eight offerings were also included in the Luther Action and the
    Maine Action. In addition to certain MBS Claims, Putnam Bank
    contends among other things that defendants made false and
    misleading statements regarding: (i) the number of mortgage
    loans in each offering that were originated under reduced
    documentation programs; (ii) the method by which mortgages
    were selected for inclusion in the collateral pools underlying
    the offerings; and (iii) the analysis conducted by ratings
    agencies prior to assigning ratings to the MBS.

Countrywide may also be subject to contractual indemnification
    obligations for the benefit of certain defendants involved in
    the MBS matters discussed above.

IndyMac
    Litigation   

In 2006 and 2007, MLPFS, CSC and other financial institutions
    participated as underwriters in MBS offerings in which IndyMac
    MBS, Inc. securitized residential mortgage loans originated or
    acquired by IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (IndyMac Bank) and created
    trusts that issued MBS. In 2009, the Corporation was named as an
    underwriter defendant, along with several other financial
    institutions, in its alleged capacity as
      successor-in-interest  
    to MLPFS and CSC in a consolidated class action in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
    entitled  In re IndyMac Mortgage-Backed Securities
    Litigation . In their complaint, plaintiffs assert MBS Claims
    relating to 106 offerings of IndyMac-related MBS. On
    June 21, 2010, the court dismissed the Corporation from the
    action because the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts
    to support their allegation that the Corporation is the
      successor-in-interest  
    to MLPFS and CSC. On August 3, 2010, plaintiffs filed a
    motion to add MLPFS and CSC as defendants, which MLPFS and CSC
    have opposed.

Merrill Lynch
    MBS Litigation   

Merrill Lynch, MLPFS, Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors, Inc.
    (MLMI) and certain current and former directors of MLMI are
    named as defendants in a putative consolidated class action in
    the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New
    York, entitled  Public Employees  Ret. System of
    Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch   Co. Inc . In
    addition to MBS Claims, plaintiffs also allege that the offering
    documents for the MBS misrepresented or omitted material facts
    regarding the credit ratings assigned to the securities. In
    March 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 65 of 84
    offerings with prejudice due to lack of standing as no named
    plaintiff purchased securities in those offerings. On
    November 8, 2010, the court dismissed claims related to 1
    of 19 remaining offerings on separate grounds. MLPFS was the
    sole underwriter of these 18 offerings. On December 1,
    2010, the defendants filed an answer to the consolidated amended
    complaint.

Cambridge
    Place Investment Management Litigation   

Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. (CPIM), as the
    alleged exclusive assignee of certain entities that allegedly
    purchased MBS offered or sold by BAS, MLPFS and CSC, brought an
    action against BAS, MLPFS, CSC and several of their affiliates
    in Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County, entitled
     Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. v. Morgan
    Stanley   Co., Inc., et al . CPIM also brought
    claims against more than 50 other defendants in this action. In
    addition to MBS Claims, CPIM contends that BAS, MLPFS, CSC and
    their affiliates made false and misleading statements in
    violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act regarding:
    (i) due diligence performed by the underwriters on the
    mortgage loans and the mortgage originators  underwriting
    practices; and (ii) the credit enhancements applicable to
    certain tranches of the MBS. On August 13, 2010, certain
    defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts. On September 13, 2010, CPIM
    filed a motion to remand the case back to state court. On
    October 12, 2010, the court referred the motion to remand
    to a Magistrate Judge for consideration. On December 28,
    2010, the Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation
    that the action be remanded to state court. On January 18,
    2011, the defendants filed an objection to that recommendation,
    which CPIM opposed on February 1, 2011. The objection to
    the Magistrate Judge s recommendation remains pending.

On February 11, 2011, CPIM commenced a separate civil
    action in Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County,
    captioned  Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. v.
    Morgan Stanley   Co., Inc., et al. , in

202        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

connection with the offering or sale of certain additional
    mortgage-backed securities by BAS, MLPFS, CSC, several of their
    affiliates and more than 40 other defendants. CPIM alleges that
    it is the assignee of the claims of certain entities that
    allegedly purchased mortgage-backed securities issued or sold by
    BAS, MLPFS and CSC in various offerings. In addition to MBS
    Claims, CPIM contends that BAS, MLPFS, CSC and their affiliates
    made false and misleading statements in violation of the
    Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act in connection with these
    offerings regarding: (i) due diligence performed by the
    underwriters on the mortgage loans and the mortgage
    originators  underwriting practices; (ii) the credit
    enhancements applicable to certain tranches of the MBS; and
    (iii) the validity of each issuing trust s title to
    the mortgage loans comprising the pool for that securitization.

Federal Home
    Loan Bank Litigation   

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB Atlanta) filed a
    complaint on January 18, 2011 against the Corporation, CFC,
    CSC and Countrywide Home Loans (CHL) in the State Court of
    Georgia, Fulton County, entitled  Federal Home Loan Bank of
    Atlanta v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al . In
    addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Atlanta contends that
    defendants made false and misleading statements regarding:
    (i) the credit ratings of the securities; and (ii) the
    transfer and assignment of the loans to the trusts.

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLB Chicago) filed a
    complaint against the Corporation, BAS, MLPFS and CSC in the
    Illinois Circuit Court, Cook County, entitled  Federal Home
    Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America Funding Corp.,
    et al.  (the Illinois Action). FHLB Chicago also filed a
    complaint against BAS, CFC and subsidiaries of CFC in the
    Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, entitled
     Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America
    Securities LLC, et al . (the California Action). In addition
    to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Chicago contends that defendants
    made false and misleading statements regarding among other
    things, the guidelines for extending mortgages to borrowers and
    the due diligence performed on repurchased and pooled loans.
    Both actions have been removed to federal court.

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB Pittsburgh)
    commenced an action against CFC, CSC and certain other
    Countrywide affiliates, as well as several ratings agencies, in
    the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County Pennsylvania,
    entitled  Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v.
    Countrywide Securities Corporation et al . FHLB Pittsburgh
    claims to have purchased MBS issued by subsidiaries of CFC in
    five offerings for approximately $366 million. In addition
    to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Pittsburgh contends that defendants
    made false and misleading statements regarding the risk
    associated with the MBS based on their credit ratings.
    Countrywide s motion to dismiss was denied on
    November 29, 2010.

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB Seattle) filed four
    separate complaints, each against different defendants,
    including the Corporation and several of its subsidiaries,
    Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, as well as certain other
    defendants, in the Superior Court of Washington for King County
    concerning four separate issuances entitled  Federal Home Loan
    Bank of Seattle v. UBS Securities LLC, et al. ;
     Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Countrywide
    Securities Corp., et al. ;  Federal Home Loan Bank of
    Seattle v. Banc of America Securities LLC, et al.
     and  Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Merrill
    Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith, Inc., et al . In
    addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB Seattle contends that
    defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the
    number of borrowers who actually lived in the houses that
    secured the mortgage loans and the business practices of the
    lending institutions that made the mortgage loans. FHLB Seattle
    claims that the sales violated the Securities Act of Washington.
    On October 18, 2010, the Corporation entities and
    Countrywide entities named as defendants in three of the cases
    filed a consolidated motion to dismiss the amended complaints,
    which is currently pending. On the same date, the

Merrill Lynch entities named as defendants in the fourth case
    filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which is
    currently pending.

The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB
    San Francisco) filed two actions against various affiliates
    of the Corporation, as well as various Countrywide and Merrill
    Lynch entities in the Superior Court of California, County of
    San Francisco, entitled: (i)  Federal Home Loan Bank
    of San Francisco v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
    LLC, et al. , which asserts claims against CFC, CSC, BAS and
    several of their affiliates; and (ii)  Federal Home Loan
    Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities
    Inc., et al. , which asserts claims against CSC and MLPFS. In
    addition to certain MBS Claims, FHLB San Francisco contends
    that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding
    the original mortgage lenders  guidelines for extending the
    loans to borrowers. FHLB San Francisco also claims that
    defendants failed to disclose that third-party ratings
    services  credit ratings of the MBS did not take into
    account defendants  false and misleading statements about
    the mortgage loans underlying the MBS. On November 5, 2010,
    FHLB San Francisco sought permission from the court to
    amend its complaint in the first action to include the
    Corporation as a defendant and, among other things, to assert
    control person liability claims against the Corporation under
    state and federal securities laws and to assert that the
    Corporation succeeded to CFC s interests. Defendants had
    removed the state court actions to federal court, but on
    December 20, 2010, the U.S. District Court, Northern
    District of California remanded the cases to state court and
    denied a motion to amend the complaint as moot when it granted
    remand. On November 5, 2010, FHLB San Francisco also
    filed a declaratory action in the Superior Court of California,
    County of San Francisco, entitled  Federal Home Loan Bank
    of San Francisco v. Bank of America Corporation and
    Does 1-10 , seeking a determination that the Corporation is a
    successor to the liabilities of CFC including the liabilities at
    issue in  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v.
    Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, et al. 

Charles Schwab
    Litigation   

The Charles Schwab Corporation (Schwab) has filed an action
    against the Corporation, BAS, Countrywide, and several of their
    affiliates, in the Superior Court of California, County of
    San Francisco, on July 15, 2010 entitled  The
    Charles Schwab Corp. v. BNP Paribas Securities Corp., et
    al . This action is in connection with the purchase by Schwab
    of approximately $577 million of MBS, $166 million of
    which relates to claims with respect to the Corporation and BAS
    and $411 million of which relates to claims with respect to
    Countrywide. In addition to MBS Claims, Schwab contends that the
    Corporation, BAS and Countrywide are liable for false and
    misleading statements regarding among other things, the business
    practices of the lending institution that made the original loan
    and MBS credit ratings. In September 2010, the Corporation, BAS
    and Countrywide joined in or consented to the removal of this
    action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
    of California. Schwab has filed a motion to remand the action to
    California state court, which remains pending.

Allstate
    Litigation   

Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company,
    Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York and American
    Heritage Life Insurance Company (collectively, the Allstate
    Plaintiffs) filed an action on December 27, 2010 against
    CFC, the Corporation, several of their affiliates and several
    individuals in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of New York, entitled  Allstate Insurance Company, et
    al., v. Countrywide Financial Corporation, et al . (the
    Allstate Action). The Allstate Plaintiffs allege that they
    purchased MBS issued by CFC related entities in 25 offerings
    between March 2005 and June 2007. All but three of the 25
    offerings in the Allstate Action are also at issue in the Luther
    and Western Teamsters Actions. Two of the 25 offerings in the
    Allstate Action are also at issue in the second amended
    complaint filed by plaintiffs in

Bank of America
    2010        203  

Table of Contents   

the Maine Action on December 6, 2010. In addition to
    certain MBS Claims, the Allstate Plaintiffs contend that
    defendants made false and misleading statements regarding:
    (i) the number of borrowers who used the properties
    securing the mortgage loans as their primary residence;
    (ii) the number of mortgage loans in each offering that
    were originated under reduced documentation programs; and
    (iii) the standards by which the mortgage loans were
    serviced after origination.

Regulatory
    Investigations   

In addition to the MBS litigation discussed beginning on
    page 201, the Corporation has also received a number of
    subpoenas and other informal requests for information from
    federal regulators regarding MBS matters, including inquiries
    related to the Corporation s underwriting and issuance of
    MBS and its participation in certain CDO offerings.

Municipal
    Derivatives Matters  

The SEC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
    the Federal Reserve and a Working Group of State Attorneys
    General (the Working Group) have investigated the Corporation,
    BANA and BAS concerning possible anticompetitive practices in
    the municipal derivatives industry dating back to the early
    1990s. These investigations have focused on the bidding
    practices for guaranteed investment contracts, the investment
    vehicles in which the proceeds of municipal bond offerings are
    deposited, as well as other types of derivative transactions
    related to municipal bonds. On January 11, 2007, the
    Corporation entered a Corporate Conditional Leniency Letter with
    the DOJ, under which the DOJ agreed not to prosecute the
    Corporation for criminal antitrust violations in connection with
    matters the Corporation has reported to the DOJ, subject to the
    Corporation s continued cooperation. On December 7,
    2010, the Corporation and its affiliates settled inquiries with
    the SEC, OCC, IRS and the Working Group for an aggregate amount
    that is not material to the Corporation s results of
    operations. In addition, the Corporation entered into an
    agreement with the Federal Reserve providing for additional
    oversight and compliance risk management.

BANA and Merrill Lynch, along with other financial institutions,
    are named as defendants in several substantially similar class
    actions and individual actions, filed in various state and
    federal courts by several municipalities that issued municipal
    bonds, as well as purchasers of municipal derivatives. These
    actions generally allege that defendants conspired to violate
    federal and state antitrust laws by allocating customers, and
    fixing or stabilizing rates of return on certain municipal
    derivatives from 1992 to the present. These actions seek
    unspecified damages, including treble damages. However, as a
    result of the Corporation s receipt of the Corporate
    Leniency Letter from the DOJ referenced above, the Corporation
    is eligible to seek a ruling that certain civil plaintiffs are
    limited to single, rather than treble, damages and relief from
    joint and several liability with co-defendants in the civil
    suits discussed below. All of the actions have been transferred
    to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York and consolidated in a single proceeding, entitled  In re
    Municipal Derivatives Antitrust Litigation . Defendants other
    than BANA and Merrill Lynch filed motions to dismiss
    plaintiffs  complaints, which the court denied in large
    part in April 2010. The action has otherwise been largely stayed
    while the DOJ completes its criminal trials concerning other
    parties.

Ocala
    Litigation  

BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation and Deutsche Bank AG each filed
    claims (the 2009 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of New York entitled  BNP
    Paribas Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.
     and  Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A .
    Plaintiffs allege that BANA failed to properly perform its
    duties as indenture trustee, collateral agent, custodian and
    depositary for Ocala Funding, LLC (Ocala), a home

mortgage warehousing facility, resulting in the loss of
    plaintiffs  investment in Ocala. Ocala was a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Taylor, Bean   Whitaker Mortgage Corp.
    (TBW), a home mortgage originator and servicer which is alleged
    to have committed fraud that led to its eventual bankruptcy.
    Ocala provided funding for TBW s mortgage origination
    activities by issuing notes, the proceeds of which were to be
    used by TBW to originate home mortgages. Such mortgages and
    other Ocala assets in turn were pledged to BANA, as collateral
    agent, to secure the notes. Plaintiffs lost most or all of their
    investment in Ocala when, as the result of the alleged fraud
    committed by TBW, Ocala was unable to repay the notes purchased
    by plaintiffs and there was insufficient collateral to satisfy
    Ocala s debt obligations. Plaintiffs allege that BANA
    breached its contractual, fiduciary and other duties to Ocala,
    thereby permitting TBW s alleged fraud to go undetected.
    Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief from BANA,
    including interest and attorneys  fees, in an unspecified
    amount, but which plaintiffs allege exceeds $1.6 billion.
    BANA s motions to dismiss these actions are currently
    pending.

On August 30, 2010, plaintiffs each filed a new lawsuit
    (the 2010 Actions) against BANA in the U.S. District Court
    for the Southern District of Florida entitled  BNP Paribas
    Mortgage Corporation v. Bank of America, N.A.  and
     Deutsche Bank AG v. Bank of America, N.A. , which the
    parties agreed to transfer to the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of New York as related to the 2009
    Actions. The 2010 Actions assert an alternative theory for
    plaintiffs to recover a portion of their Ocala losses from BANA.
    Plaintiffs allege that BANA s commercial division purchased
    from TBW participation interests in pools of mortgage loans that
    allegedly included loans that were already pledged as collateral
    for plaintiffs  Ocala notes. Plaintiffs allege that the
    purchase of these participation interests constituted conversion
    of the underlying mortgage loans and that BANA is thus required
    to reimburse plaintiffs for the value of these loans. Plaintiffs
    seek compensatory and other damages, interest and
    attorneys  fees in amounts that are unspecified but which
    plaintiffs allege exceed approximately $665 million,
    representing a portion of the same losses alleged in the 2009
    Actions. BANA s motion to dismiss the 2010 Actions was
    argued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
    of New York on January 26, 2011.

On October 1, 2010, BANA, on behalf of Ocala s
    investors, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Columbia against the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC) as receiver of Colonial Bank (TBW s
    primary bank) and Platinum Community Bank (a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of TBW) entitled  Bank of America, National
    Association as indenture trustee, custodian and collateral agent
    for Ocala Funding, LLC v. Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation . The suit seeks judicial review of the
    FDIC s denial of the administrative claims brought by BANA,
    on behalf of Ocala, in the FDIC s Colonial and Platinum
    receivership proceedings. BANA s claims allege that
    Ocala s losses were in whole or in part the result of
    Colonial s and Platinum s participation in TBW s
    alleged fraud. BANA seeks a court order requiring the FDIC to
    allow BANA s claims in an amount equal to Ocala s
    losses and, accordingly, to permit BANA, as trustee, collateral
    agent, custodian and depositary for Ocala, to share
    appropriately in distributions of any receivership assets that
    the FDIC makes to creditors of the two failed banks.

Parmalat  

On November 23, 2005, the Official Liquidators of Food
    Holdings Limited and Dairy Holdings Limited, two entities in
    liquidation proceedings in the Cayman Islands, filed a complaint
    in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York, entitled  Food Holdings Ltd, et al. v. Bank of
    America Corp., et al. , against the Corporation and several
    related entities. Plaintiffs allege that the Corporation and
    other defendants conspired with Parmalat, which was admitted to
    insolvency proceedings in Italy in December 2003, in carrying
    out transactions involving the plaintiffs in connection with the
    funding of Parmalat s Brazilian entities. Plaintiffs assert
    claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
    fiduciary duty and other related claims. The complaint

seeks in excess of $400 million in compensatory damages and
    interest, among other relief. On February 17, 2010, the
    court dismissed all of plaintiffs  claims. On
    March 18, 2010, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on
    April 1, 2010, the Corporation filed a cross-appeal.
    Briefing was completed in December 2010.

NOTE 15  Shareholders 
    Equity   

Common
    Stock  

In October 2010, July 2010, April 2010 and January 2010, the
    Board declared the fourth, third, second and first
    quarters  cash dividends of $0.01 per common share, which
    were paid on December 24, 2010, September 24, 2010,
    June 25, 2010 and March 26, 2010 to common
    shareholders of record on December 3, 2010,
    September 3, 2010, June 4, 2010 and March 5,
    2010, respectively. In addition, in January 2011, the Board
    declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.01 per common share
    payable on March 25, 2011 to common shareholders of record
    on March 4, 2011.

On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a special
    meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder
    approval of an amendment to the Corporation s amended and
    restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of
    authorized shares of common stock from 10.0 billion to
    11.3 billion. On April 28, 2010, at the
    Corporation s 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the
    Corporation obtained shareholder approval of an amendment to the
    Corporation s amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
    common stock from 11.3 billion to 12.8 billion.

In January 2009, the Corporation issued 1.4 billion shares
    of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Merrill
    Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch
    acquisition, see  Note 2   Merger and
    Restructuring Activity . During 2009 and 2008, in connection
    with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government under
    the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Corporation issued
    warrants to purchase 121.8 million shares of common stock
    at an exercise price of $30.79 per share and 150.4 million
    shares of common stock at an exercise price of $13.30 per share.
    The U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010.

In May 2009, the Corporation issued 1.3 billion shares of
    its common stock at an average price of $10.77 per share through
    an
     at-the-market 
    issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately
    $13.5 billion.

Through a 2008 authorized share repurchase program, the
    Corporation had the ability to repurchase shares of its common
    stock, subject to certain restrictions, from time to time, in
    the open market or in private transactions. The 2008 authorized
    repurchase program expired on January 23, 2010. There is no
    existing Board authorized share repurchase program. In 2010, the
    Corporation did not repurchase any shares of common stock and
    issued approximately 98.6 million shares under employee
    stock plans. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had
    reserved 1.5 billion unissued shares of common stock for
    future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock
    warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.

Preferred
    Stock  

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate dividends declared on
    preferred stock were $1.4 billion, $4.5 billion and
    $1.3 billion, respectively. This included $474 million
    and $536 million in 2010 and 2009 related to preferred
    stock issued or remaining outstanding as a part of the Merrill
    Lynch acquisition.

In connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, Merrill Lynch
    non-convertible preferred shareholders received Bank of America
    Corporation preferred stock having substantially identical
    terms. On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares
    of the mandatory convertible preferred stock of Merrill Lynch
    automatically converted into an aggregate of 50 million
    shares of the Corporation s Common Stock in accordance with
    the terms of these preferred securities.

In October 2008, in connection with TARP, the Corporation issued
    to the U.S. Treasury non-voting perpetual preferred stock
    and warrants for $15.0 billion. In addition, in January
    2009, in connection with TARP and the Merrill Lynch acquisition,
    the Corporation issued additional preferred stock for
    $30.0 billion.

In December 2009, the Corporation repurchased the non-voting
    perpetual preferred stock previously issued to the
    U.S. Treasury (TARP Preferred Stock) through the use of
    $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in
    proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion Common Equivalent
    Securities (CES) valued at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of
    depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common
    Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common
    Equivalent Stock) and contingent warrants to purchase an
    aggregate of 60 million shares of the Corporation s
    common stock. On February 23, 2010, the Corporation held a
    special meeting of stockholders at which it obtained shareholder
    approval of an amendment to the Corporation s amended and
    restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of
    authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Common
    Equivalent Stock automatically converted in full into
    1.286 billion shares of common stock on February 24,
    2010. In addition, as a result, the contingent warrants expired
    without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist.

During 2009, the Corporation entered into agreements with
    certain holders of non-government perpetual preferred stock to
    exchange their holdings of approximately $7.3 billion
    aggregate liquidation preference, before third-party issuance
    costs, of approximately 323 million shares of perpetual
    preferred stock for approximately 545 million shares of
    common stock with a fair value of stock issued of
    $6.1 billion. In addition, the Corporation exchanged
    approximately $3.9 billion aggregate liquidation
    preference, before third-party issuance costs, of approximately
    144 million shares of non-government preferred stock for
    approximately 200 million shares of common stock in an
    exchange offer with a fair value of stock issued of
    $2.5 billion. In total, these exchanges resulted in the
    exchange of approximately $11.3 billion aggregate
    liquidation preference, before third-party issuance costs, of
    approximately 467 million shares of preferred stock into
    approximately 745 million shares of common stock with a
    fair value of stock issued of $8.6 billion.

In addition, during 2009, the Corporation exchanged
    3.6 million shares, or $3.6 billion aggregate
    liquidation preference of Series L 7.25% Non-Cumulative
    Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock into 255 million
    shares of common stock valued at $2.8 billion, which was
    accounted for as an induced conversion of preferred stock.

As a result of these exchanges, the Corporation recorded an
    increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) applicable
    to common shareholders of $576 million. This represents the
    net of a $2.62 billion benefit due to the excess of the
    carrying value of the Corporation s non-convertible
    preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock
    exchanged. This was partially offset by a $2.04 billion
    inducement representing the excess of the fair value of the
    common stock exchanged over the fair value of the common stock
    that would have been issued under the original conversion terms.

Series L Preferred Stock does not have early
    redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L
    Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of
    the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporation s common
    stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. On or after
    January 30, 2013, the Corporation may cause some or all of
    the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or
    from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock
    at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days
    during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing
    price of common stock exceeds 130 percent of the
    then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred
    Stock. If the Corporation exercises its rights to cause the
    automatic conversion of Series L Preferred Stock on
    January 30, 2013, it will still pay any accrued dividends
    payable on January 30, 2013 to the applicable holders of
    record.

NOTE 17  Earnings
    Per Common Share   

The calculation of EPS and diluted EPS for 2010, 2009 and 2008
    is presented below. See  Note 1   Summary of
    Significant Accounting Principles  for additional information
    on the calculation of EPS.

(1)   

Includes incremental shares from
    RSUs, restricted stock shares, stock options and warrants.

Due to the net loss applicable to common shareholders for 2010
    and 2009, no dilutive potential common shares were included in
    the calculation of diluted EPS because they would have been
    antidilutive.

For 2010, 2009 and 2008, average options to purchase
    271 million, 315 million and 181 million shares,
    respectively, of common stock were outstanding but not included
    in the computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under
    the treasury stock method. For 2010 and 2009, average warrants
    to purchase 272 million and 265 million shares of
    common stock were outstanding but not included in the
    computation of EPS because they were antidilutive under the
    treasury stock method. For 2010 and 2009, 107 million and
    147 million average dilutive potential common shares
    associated with the convertible Series L Preferred Stock,
    and the mandatory convertible Preferred Stock Series 2 and
    Series 3 of Merrill Lynch were excluded from the diluted
    share count because the result would have been antidilutive
    under the  if-converted  method. For 2009,
    81 million average dilutive potential common shares
    associated with the CES were also excluded from the diluted
    share count because the result would have been antidilutive
    under the  if-converted  method. For 2008,
    128 million average dilutive potential common shares
    associated with the convertible Series L Preferred Stock
    were excluded from the diluted share count because the result
    would have been antidilutive under the  if-converted 
    method.

For purposes of computing basic EPS, CES were considered to be
    participating securities prior to February 24, 2010,
    however, due to a net loss for 2010, CES were not allocated
    earnings. The two-class method prohibits the allocation of an
    undistributed loss to participating securities. For purposes of
    computing diluted EPS, there was no dilutive effect of the CES,
    which were outstanding prior to February 24, 2010, due to a
    net loss for 2010.

For 2009, as a result of repurchasing the TARP Preferred Stock,
    the Corporation accelerated the remaining accretion of the
    issuance discount on the TARP Preferred Stock of
    $4.0 billion and recorded a corresponding charge to
    retained earnings and income (loss) applicable to common
    shareholders in the calculation of diluted earnings per common
    share. In addition, in 2009, the Corporation recorded an
    increase to retained earnings and net income (loss) available to
    common shareholders of $576 million related to the
    Corporation s preferred stock exchange for common stock.

NOTE 18  Regulatory
    Requirements and Restrictions   

The Federal Reserve requires the Corporation s banking
    subsidiaries to maintain reserve balances based on a percentage
    of certain deposits. Average daily reserve balances required by
    the Federal Reserve were $12.9 billion and
    $10.9 billion for 2010 and 2009. Currency and coin residing
    in branches and cash vaults (vault cash) are used to partially
    satisfy the reserve requirement. The average daily reserve
    balances, in excess of vault cash, held with the Federal Reserve
    amounted to $5.5 billion and $3.4 billion for 2010 and
    2009.

The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the
    Corporation to its shareholders are dividends received from its
    banking subsidiaries, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card
    Services, N.A. In 2010, the Corporation received
    $4.6 billion in dividends from Bank of America, N.A. In
    2011, Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. can
    declare and pay dividends to the Corporation of
    $5.8 billion and $0 plus an additional amount equal to
    their net profits for 2011, as defined by statute, up to the
    date of any such dividend declaration. The other subsidiary
    national banks can pay dividends in aggregate in 2011 of
    $53 million plus an additional amount equal to their net
    profits for 2011, as defined by statute, up to the date of any
    such dividend declaration. The amount of dividends that each
    subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without approval
    by the OCC is the subsidiary bank s net profits for that
    year combined with its net retained profits, as defined, for the
    preceding two years.

The Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision
    (collectively, joint agencies) have in place regulatory capital
    guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Failure to meet
    the capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and
    discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material
    effect on the Corporation s financial position. The
    regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to the
    credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items
    using various risk weights. Under the regulatory capital
    guidelines, Total capital consists of three tiers of capital.
    Tier 1 capital includes qualifying common
    shareholders  equity, CES, qualifying noncumulative
    perpetual preferred stock, qualifying Trust Securities,
    hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interests, less
    goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of
    qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the

208        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

allowance for loan and lease losses, a portion of net unrealized
    gains on AFS marketable equity securities and other adjustments.
    Tier 3 capital includes subordinated debt that is
    unsecured, fully paid, has an original maturity of at least two
    years, is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval
    by the Federal Reserve and includes a lock-in clause precluding
    payment of either interest or principal if the payment would
    cause the issuing bank s risk-based capital ratio to fall
    or remain below the required minimum. Tier 3 capital can
    only be used to satisfy the Corporation s market risk
    capital requirement and may not be used to support its credit
    risk requirement. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Corporation had no subordinated debt that qualified as
    Tier 3 capital.

Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue
    Trust Securities are not consolidated. In accordance with
    Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities continue to qualify
    as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that
    will be effective on March 31, 2011. As a result, the
    Corporation includes Trust Securities in Tier 1
    capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under
    which the Corporation s previously issued and outstanding
    Trust Securities in the aggregate amount of
    $19.9 billion (approximately 137 bps of Tier 1
    capital) at December 31, 2010, will no longer qualify as
    Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. This amount
    excludes $1.6 billion of hybrid Trust Securities that
    are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the
    date of implementation. The exclusion of Trust Securities
    from Tier 1 capital will be phased in incrementally over a
    three-year phase-in period. The treatment of
    Trust Securities during the phase-in period remains unclear
    and is subject to future rulemaking.

Current limits restrict core capital elements to 15 percent
    of total core capital elements for internationally active bank
    holding companies. Internationally active bank holding companies
    are those that have significant activities in
     non-U.S. markets 
    with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or
    on-balance sheet
     non-U.S. exposure 
    greater than $10 billion. In addition, the Federal Reserve
    revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments
    included in regulatory capital. At December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation s restricted core capital elements comprised
    11.4 percent of total core capital elements. The
    Corporation is and expects to remain fully compliant with the
    revised limits.

To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements,
    an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of four
    percent and a Total capital ratio of eight percent. A
     well-capitalized  institution must generally maintain
    capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines.
    The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a
    Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital
    divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain
    adjustments.  Well-capitalized  bank holding companies
    must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent.
    National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at
    least five percent to be classified as
     well-capitalized.  At December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and
    Tier 1 leverage ratios were 11.24 percent,
    15.77 percent and 7.21 percent, respectively. This
    classifies the Corporation as  well-capitalized  for
    regulatory purposes, the highest classification.

Net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and
    marketable equity securities, net unrealized gains and losses on
    derivatives, and employee benefit plan adjustments in
    shareholders  equity are excluded from the calculations of
    Tier 1 common capital as discussed below, Tier 1
    capital and leverage ratios. The Total capital ratio excludes
    all of the above with the exception of up to 45 percent of
    the pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity
    securities.

The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as
    Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock,
    qualifying Trust Securities, hybrid securities and
    qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was
    included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable
    regulatory guidance and the expectation at December 31,
    2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred
    Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following
    shareholder approval of additional authorized shares.
    Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized
    shares of common stock and the Common Equivalent Stock converted
    into common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common
    capital was $125.1 billion and $120.4 billion and the
    Tier 1 common capital ratio was 8.60 percent and
    7.81 percent at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The table below presents actual and minimum required regulatory
    capital amounts for 2010 and 2009.

Regulatory
    Capital Developments  

In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the
    intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements
    with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While
    economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the
    Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to
    regulatory standards of capital adequacy.

The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was
    published on December 7, 2007, established requirements for
    the U.S. implementation and provided detailed requirements
    for a new regulatory capital framework related to credit and
    operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar
    2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). The Corporation
    began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1,
    2010.

Subsequently, amended rules issued by the Basel Committee on
    Bank Supervision known as Basel III were published in
    December 2010 along with final Market Risk Rules issued by the
    Federal Reserve. The Basel III rules and the Financial
    Reform Act seek to disqualify trust preferred securities and
    other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital
    treatment with the Financial Reform Act proposing it to be
    phased in over a period from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also
    proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred
    tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension
    assets, among others, within prescribed limitations certain of
    which may be significant), increased capital for counterparty
    credit risk, and three capital buffers to strengthen capital
    levels which would be also phased in over time. The three
    capital buffers include a capital conservation buffer, a
    countercyclical buffer and a systematically important financial
    institution buffer, which would result in a minimum Total
    capital ratio of at least eight percent by 2013. Market Risk
    Rules include additional VaR based measurements, among others,
    that are meant to further strengthen capital levels. The
    Corporation continues to monitor the development and potential
    impact of these rules, and has determined that given current
    initiatives and continued focus on all of these rules by the
    date of full implementation in 2018, the Corporation must have a
    Tier 1 common capital ratio of seven percent which it
    anticipates it will meet. The Corporation does not expect the
    need to issue any common stock to meet the new Basel proposals.

There remains significant uncertainty on the final impacts as
    the U.S. has issued final rules only for Basel II and
    a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at
    this time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules
    for Basel III and the regulatory agencies interpret the final
    rules during the implementation process.

NOTE 19  Employee
    Benefit Plans   

Pension and
    Postretirement Plans  

The Corporation sponsors noncontributory trusteed pension plans
    that cover substantially all officers and employees, a number of
    noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement
    health and life plans. The plans provide defined benefits based
    on an employee s compensation and years of service. The
    Bank of America Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) provides
    participants with compensation credits, generally based on years
    of service. For account balances based on compensation credits
    prior to January 1, 2008, the Pension Plan allows
    participants to select from various earnings measures, which are
    based on the returns of certain funds or common stock of the
    Corporation. The participant-selected earnings measures
    determine the earnings rate on the individual participant
    account balances in the Pension Plan. Participants may elect to
    modify earnings measure allocations on a periodic basis subject
    to the provisions of the Pension Plan. For account balances
    based on compensation credits subsequent to December 31,
    2007, the account balance earnings rate is based on a benchmark
    rate. For eligible employees in the Pension Plan on or after
    January 1, 2008, the benefits become vested upon completion
    of three years of service. It is the

policy of the Corporation to fund not less than the minimum
    funding amount required by ERISA.

The Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account
    balances with participant-selected earnings, applied at the time
    a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively
    provides principal protection for participant balances
    transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is
    responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.

In May 2008, the Corporation and the IRS entered into a closing
    agreement resolving all matters relating to an audit by the IRS
    of the Pension Plan and the Bank of America 401(k) Plan. The
    audit included a review of voluntary transfers by participants
    of 401(k) Plan accounts to the Pension Plan. In connection with
    the agreement, during 2009 the Pension Plan transferred
    approximately $1.2 billion of assets and liabilities
    associated with the transferred accounts to a newly established
    defined contribution plan.

As a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the
    obligations related to the pension plans of FleetBoston, MBNA,
    U.S. Trust Corporation, LaSalle and Countrywide. These
    five acquired pension plans have been merged into a separate
    defined benefit pension plan, which, together with the Pension
    Plan, are referred to as the Qualified Pension Plans. The
    benefit structures under these acquired plans have not changed
    and remain intact in the merged plan. Certain benefit structures
    are substantially similar to the Pension Plan discussed above;
    however, certain of these structures do not allow participants
    to select various earnings measures; rather the earnings rate is
    based on a benchmark rate. In addition, these benefit structures
    include participants with benefits determined under formulas
    based on average or career compensation and years of service
    rather than by reference to a pension account. Certain of the
    other benefit structures provide participant s retirement
    benefits based on the number of years of benefit service and a
    percentage of the participant s average annual compensation
    during the five highest paid consecutive years of the last ten
    years of employment.

As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation
    assumed the obligations related to the plans of Merrill Lynch.
    These plans include a terminated U.S. pension plan,
     non-U.S. pension 
    plans, nonqualified pension plans and postretirement plans. The
     non-U.S. 
    pension plans vary based on the country and local practices. The
    terminated U.S. pension plan is referred to as the Other
    Pension Plan.

In 1988, Merrill Lynch purchased a group annuity contract that
    guarantees the payment of benefits vested under the terminated
    U.S. pension plan. The Corporation, under a supplemental
    agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit from actual
    experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The
    Corporation made no contribution in 2010 and contributed
    $120 million during 2009 under this agreement. Additional
    contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.

The Corporation sponsors a number of noncontributory,
    nonqualified pension plans (the Nonqualified Pension Plans). As
    a result of acquisitions, the Corporation assumed the
    obligations related to the noncontributory, nonqualified pension
    plans of certain legacy companies including Merrill Lynch. These
    plans, which are unfunded, provide defined pension benefits to
    certain employees.

In addition to retirement pension benefits, full-time, salaried
    employees and certain part-time employees may become eligible to
    continue participation as retirees in health care
     and/or  life
    insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. Based on the other
    provisions of the individual plans, certain retirees may also
    have the cost of these benefits partially paid by the
    Corporation. The obligations assumed as a result of acquisitions
    are substantially similar to the Corporation s
    postretirement health and life plans, except for Countrywide
    which did not have a postretirement health and life plan.
    Collectively, these plans are referred to as the Postretirement
    Health and Life Plans.

The table below summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan
    assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the
    funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO)
    and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to
    determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and
    postretirement plans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Amounts
    recognized at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are reflected in
    other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The discount rate assumption is
    based on a cash flow matching

technique and is subject to change each year. This technique
    utilizes yield curves that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds
    with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of
    the plans to produce the discount rate assumptions. The asset
    valuation method for the Qualified Pension Plans recognizes
    60 percent of the prior year s market gains or losses
    at the next measurement date with the remaining 40 percent
    spread equally over the subsequent four years.

The measurement date for the
    Qualified Pension Plans,

Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of

    subject to ERISA or
     non-U.S. pension 
    plans where funding strategies vary due to legal requirements
    and local practices.

Net periodic benefit cost (income) for 2010, 2009 and 2008
    included the following components.

n/a = not applicable

The net periodic benefit cost (income) for each of the plans in
    2010 and 2009 includes Merrill Lynch. The net periodic benefit
    cost (income) of the Merrill Lynch Nonqualified and Other
    Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans was
    $(20) million and $18 million in 2009 using a blended
    discount rate of 5.59 percent at January 1, 2009.

Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was
    determined using the  projected unit credit  actuarial
    method. Gains and losses for all benefits except postretirement
    health care are recognized in accordance with the standard
    amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance.
    For the Postretirement Health Care Plans, 50 percent of the
    unrecognized gain or

loss at the beginning of the fiscal year (or at subsequent
    remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year.

The discount rate and expected return on plan assets impact the
    net periodic benefit cost (income) recorded for the plans. With
    all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in
    the discount rate and expected return on plan assets would
    result in an increase of approximately $50 million and
    $41 million, respectively, for the Qualified Pension Plans.
    For the
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans, the Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and
    Postretirement Health and Life Plans, the 25-basis point decline
    in rates would not have a significant impact.

Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement
    benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the
    Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care
    cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits
    covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans was
    7.50 percent for 2011, reducing in steps to
    5.00 percent in 2017 and later years. A
    one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend
    rates would have increased the service and interest costs and
    the

benefit obligation by $4 million and $62 million in
    2010. A one-percentage-point decrease in assumed health care
    cost trend rates would have lowered the service and interest
    costs and the benefit obligation by $4 million and
    $58 million in 2010.

Plan
    Assets  

The Qualified Pension Plans have been established as retirement
    vehicles for participants, and trusts have been established to
    secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plans. The
    Corporation s policy is to invest the trust assets in a
    prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits
    to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of
    administration. The Corporation s investment strategy is
    designed to provide a total return that, over the long term,
    increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy
    attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level
    of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying
    with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The
    investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal
    determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the
    assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically
    reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability
    characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers
    are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the
    assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to
    minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes
    matching the equity exposure of participant-selected earnings
    measures. For example, the common stock of the Corporation held
    in the trust is maintained as an offset to the exposure related
    to participants who elected to receive an earnings measure

based on the return performance of common stock of the
    Corporation. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the
    Corporation during 2011.

The assets of the
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans are primarily attributable to the U.K. pension plan. The
    U.K. pension plan s assets are invested prudently so that
    the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration
    given to the nature and the duration of the plan s
    liabilities. The current planned investment strategy was set
    following an asset-liability study and advice from the
    trustee s investment advisors. The selected asset
    allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than
    the lowest risk strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to
    meeting the plan s liabilities.

The Expected Return on Asset assumption (EROA assumption) was
    developed through analysis of historical market returns,
    historical asset class volatility and correlations, current
    market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the
    funds  past experience, and expectations on potential
    future market returns. The EROA assumption is determined using
    the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension
    Plans and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The EROA
    assumption represents a long-term average view of the
    performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plans, the
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and
    Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any
    one

calendar year. Some of the building blocks used to arrive at the
    long-term return assumption include an implied return from
    equity securities of 8.75 percent, debt securities of
    5.75 percent and real estate of 7.00 percent for the
    Qualified Pension Plans, the
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and
    Life Plans. The terminated U.S. pension plan is solely
    invested in a group annuity contract which primarily invested in
    fixed-

income securities structured such that asset maturities match
    the duration of the plan s obligations.

The target allocations for 2011 by asset category for the
    Qualified Pension Plans,
     Non-U.S. Pension 
    Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement
    Health and Life Plans are presented in the following table.

Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plans include common
    stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $189 million
    (1.21 percent of total plan assets) and $224 million
    (1.54 percent of total plan assets) at December 31,

    retirement plans. As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition,
    the Corporation also maintains the defined contribution plans of
    Merrill Lynch which include the 401(k) Savings  
    Investment Plan, the Retirement and Accumulation Plan (RAP) and
    the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The Corporation
    contributed approximately $670 million, $605 million
    and $454 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in

cash, to the qualified defined contribution plans. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, 208 million shares and
    203 million shares of the Corporation s common stock
    were held by plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on
    common stock were $8 million, $8 million and
    $214 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In addition, certain
     non-U.S. employees

    pension plans that are separately administered in accordance
    with local laws.

NOTE 20  Stock-based
    Compensation Plans   

The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation
    plans, including the Key Employee Stock Plan, the Key Associate
    Stock Plan and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation
    Plan. Descriptions of the material features of the equity
    compensation plans are below. Under these plans, the Corporation
    grants long-term stock-based awards, including stock options,
    restricted stock shares and RSUs. For 2010, restricted stock
    awards generally vest in three equal annual installments
    beginning one year from the grant date, with the exception of
    certain awards to financial advisors that vest eight years from
    the grant date, and an award of restricted stock shares that was
    vested on the grant date but released from restrictions over
    18 months.

For most awards, expense is generally recognized ratably over
    the vesting period net of estimated forfeitures, unless the
    associate meets certain retirement eligibility criteria. For
    associate awards that meet retirement eligibility criteria, the
    Corporation records the expense upon grant. For associates that
    become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the
    Corporation recognizes expense from the grant date to the date
    on which the associate becomes retirement eligible, net of
    estimated forfeitures. The compensation cost for the following
    stock-based plans was $2.0 billion, $2.4 billion and
    $885 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    related income tax benefit was $727 million,
    $892 million and $328 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Key Employee
    Stock Plan  

The Key Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provided
    for different types of awards including stock options,
    restricted stock shares and RSUs. Under the plan,
     10-year 
    options to purchase approximately 260 million shares of
    common stock were granted through December 31, 2002 to
    certain employees at the closing market price on the respective
    grant dates. At December 31, 2010, approximately
    36 million fully vested options were outstanding under this
    plan. No further awards may be granted.

Key Associate
    Stock Plan  

The Key Associate Stock Plan became effective January 1,
    2003. It provides for different types of long-term awards,
    including stock options, restricted stock shares and RSUs. As of
    December 31, 2010, the shareholders had authorized
    approximately 1.1 billion shares for grant under this plan.
    Additionally, any shares covered by awards under the Key
    Employee Stock Plan or certain legacy company plans that cancel,
    terminate, expire, lapse or settle in cash after a specified
    date may be re-granted under the Key Associate Stock Plan.

In February 2010, the Corporation issued approximately
    191 million RSUs to certain employees under the Key
    Associate Stock Plan. These awards generally vest in three equal
    annual installments beginning one year from the grant date.
    Vested RSUs will be settled in cash unless the Corporation
    authorizes settlement in common shares. Certain awards contain
    clawback provisions which permit the Corporation to cancel all
    or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. The
    compensation cost for cash-settled awards and awards subject to
    certain clawback provisions is accrued over the vesting period
    and adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price
    of the Corporation s common stock. The compensation cost
    for the remaining awards is fixed and based on the share price
    of the common stock on the date of grant, or the date upon which
    settlement in common stock has been authorized. The Corporation
    hedges a portion of its exposure to variability in the expected
    cash flows for unvested awards using a combination of economic
    and cash flow hedges as described in  Note 4  
    Derivatives . During 2010, the Corporation authorized
    approximately 100 million RSUs to be settled in common
    shares and terminated a portion of the corresponding economic
    and cash flow hedges. As a result of the decision to
    share-settle these RSUs, these share-settled RSUs are no longer
    adjusted to fair value based upon changes in the share price of
    the Corporation s common stock.

At December 31, 2010, approximately 140 million
    options were outstanding under this plan. There were no options
    granted under this plan during 2010 or 2009.

Merrill Lynch
    Employee Stock Compensation Plan  

The Corporation assumed the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock
    Compensation Plan. Shares can be granted under this plan in the
    future. Approximately 34 million shares of RSUs were
    granted in 2009 which generally vest in three equal annual
    installments beginning one year from the grant date. Awards
    granted prior to 2009 generally vest in four equal annual
    installments beginning one year from the grant date. There were
    no shares granted under this plan during 2010. At
    December 31, 2010, there were approximately 28 million
    shares outstanding.

Other Stock
    Plans  

As a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the Corporation
    assumed the obligations of outstanding awards granted under the
    Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plans
    (FACAAP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (ESPP). The FACAAP is no longer an active plan and no awards
    were granted in 2010 or 2009. Awards granted in 2003 and
    thereafter are generally payable eight years from the grant date
    in a fixed number of the Corporation s common stock. For
    outstanding awards granted prior to 2003, payment is generally
    made ten years from the grant date in a fixed number of the
    Corporation s common shares unless the fair value of such
    shares is less than a specified minimum value, in which case the
    minimum value is paid in cash. At December 31, 2010, there
    were 18 million shares outstanding under this plan.

The ESPP allows eligible associates to invest from one percent
    to 10 percent of eligible compensation to purchase the
    Corporation s common stock, subject to legal limits.
    Purchases were made at a discount of up to five percent of the
    average high and low market price on the relevant purchase date
    and the maximum annual contribution per employee was $23,750 in
    2010. Up to 107 million shares have been authorized for
    issuance under the ESPP in 2010. There were 12 million
    shares available at January 1, 2010 and 3 million
    shares purchased during the year. There were 9 million
    shares available at December 31, 2010.

The weighted-average fair value of the ESPP stock purchase
    rights (i.e., the five percent discount on the
    Corporation s common stock purchases) exercised by
    employees in 2010 is $0.80 per stock purchase right.

Restricted
    Stock/Unit Details  

The following table presents the status of the share-settled
    restricted stock/unit awards at December 31, 2010 and
    changes during 2010.

At December 31, 2010, there was $944 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
    compensation arrangements for all awards and it is expected to
    be recognized over a period up to seven years, with a
    weighted-average period of 1.07 years. The total fair value
    of restricted stock vested in 2010 was $2.4 billion. In
    2010, the amount of cash used to settle equity instruments was
    $186 million.

    term of options outstanding was 3.0 years, options
    exercisable was 3.0 years, and options vested and expected
    to vest was 3.1 years at December 31, 2010. These
    remaining contractual terms are similar because options have not
    been granted since 2008 and they generally vest in three years.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in
    2008 was $8.92. No options were granted in 2010 or 2009.

The table below presents the assumptions used to estimate the
    fair value of stock options granted on the date of grant using
    the lattice option-pricing model for 2008. No stock options were
    granted in 2010 or 2009. Lattice option-pricing models
    incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs and those ranges
    are disclosed in the table below. The risk-free interest rate
    for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied
    volatilities from traded stock options on the Corporation s
    common stock, historical volatility of the Corporation s
    common stock, and other factors. The Corporation uses historical
    data to estimate stock option exercise and employee termination
    within the model. The expected term of stock options granted is
    derived from the output of the model and represents the period
    of time that stock options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. The estimates of fair value from these models are
    theoretical values for stock options and changes in the
    assumptions used in the models could result in materially
    different fair value estimates. The actual value of the stock
    options will depend on the market value of the
    Corporation s common stock when the stock options are
    exercised.

Excluded from the previous table are assumptions used to
    estimate the fair value of 108 million stock options
    assumed in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition with an
    aggregate fair value of $1.1 billion. The fair value of
    these awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Similar to options valued using the lattice
    option-pricing model described above, key assumptions used
    include the implied volatility based on the Corporation s
    common stock of 75 percent, the risk-free interest rate
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
    December 31, 2008, an expected dividend yield of
    4.2 percent and the expected life of the options based on
    their actual remaining term.

NOTE 21  Income
    Taxes   

The components of income tax expense (benefit) for 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were as presented in the table below.

Total income tax expense (benefit) does not reflect the deferred
    tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and
    marketable equity securities, foreign currency translation
    adjustments, derivatives and employee benefit plan adjustments
    that are included in accumulated OCI. As a result of these tax
    effects, accumulated OCI decreased $3.2 billion and
    $1.6 billion in 2010 and 2009, and increased
    $5.9 billion in 2008. In addition, total income tax expense
    (benefit) does not reflect tax effects associated with the
    Corporation s employee stock plans which decreased common
    stock and additional paid-in capital $98 million,
    $295 million and $9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Income tax expense (benefit) for 2010, 2009 and 2008 varied from
    the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to
    income (loss) before income taxes. A reconciliation between the
    expected U.S. federal

income tax expense using the federal statutory tax rate of
    35 percent to the Corporation s actual income tax
    expense (benefit) and resulting effective tax rate for 2010,
    2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below.

The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits
    (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the table
    below.

Reconciliation
    of the Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits   

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the balance of the
    Corporation s UTBs which would, if recognized, affect the
    Corporation s effective tax rate was $3.4 billion,
    $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Included
    in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would
    not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of
    certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs
    that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated
    federal deduction and the portion of gross
     non-U.S. UTBs 
    that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.

The Corporation is under examination by the IRS and other tax
    authorities in countries and states in which it has significant
    business operations. The table below summarizes the status of
    significant examinations for the Corporation and various
    acquired subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010.

(1)   

All tax years subsequent to the
    years shown remain open to examination.

(2)   

The
     2001-2002 years 
    in Appeals process relate to the separate returns of a
    subsidiary.

In addition to the above examinations, the Corporation is in the
    process of appealing an adverse decision by the U.S. Tax
    Court with respect to a 1987 Merrill Lynch transaction. The
    income tax associated with this matter has been remitted and is
    included in the UTB balance above.

The IRS proposed adjustments for two issues in the audit of
    Merrill Lynch for the tax year 2004 which have been protested to
    the Appeals Office. The issues involve eligibility for the
    dividends received deduction and foreign tax credits with
    respect to a structured investment transaction. The Corporation
    also intends to protest any adjustments the IRS proposes for
    these same issues in tax years 2005 through 2007. The IRS has
    proposed similar adjustments in the Bank of America Corporation
    audit cycles currently in the Appeals process and is expected to
    propose further adjustments disallowing foreign tax credits
    related to certain structured investment transactions. The
    Corporation intends to protest these adjustments in all relevant
    tax years.

The Corporation files income tax returns in more than
    100 state and
     non-U.S. jurisdictions 
    each year and is under continuous examination by various state
    and
     non-U.S. taxing 
    authorities. While many of these examinations are resolved every
    year, the Corporation does not anticipate that resolutions
    occurring within the next twelve months will result in a
    material change to the Corporation s financial position.

Considering all U.S. federal and
     non-U.S. examinations, 
    it is reasonably possible that the UTB balance will decrease by
    as much as $1.0 billion during the next twelve months,
    since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether
    their resolution resulted in payment or recognition.

During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation recognized in income tax
    expense $99 million and $184 million of interest and
    penalties,
     net-of-tax. 
    At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation s
    accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes,
    net of taxes and remittances, was $1.1 billion.

Significant components of the Corporation s net deferred
    tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    are presented in the table below.

On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new
    consolidation guidance and the transition adjustment included an
    increase of $3.5 billion in retained earnings which was
    offset against net deferred tax assets. On July 1, 2010,
    the Corporation adopted new accounting guidance on embedded
    credit derivatives and the related fair value option election
    and the transition adjustment included an increase of
    $128 million in retained earnings which is offset against
    net deferred tax assets.

The U.S. federal deferred tax asset excludes
    $56 million related to certain employee stock plan
    deductions that will be recognized and will increase additional
    paid-in capital when realized.

The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related
    valuation allowances recognized for the net operating and
    capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards at
    December 31, 2010.

(1)   

The U.K. NOL may be carried
    forward indefinitely. Due to
     change-in-control 
    limitations in the three years prior to and following the change
    in ownership, this unlimited carryforward period may be
    jeopardized by certain major changes in the nature or conduct of
    the U.K. businesses.

(2)   

The NOL and related valuation
    allowance for U.S. states before considering the benefit of
    federal deductions were $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion.

The Corporation concluded that no valuation allowance is
    necessary to reduce the U.K. NOL, U.S. NOL and general
    business credit carryforwards since estimated future taxable
    income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their
    expiration. With the acquisition of Merrill Lynch on
    January 1, 2009, the Corporation established a valuation
    allowance to reduce certain other deferred tax assets to the
    amount more-likely-than-not to be realized before their
    expiration. During 2010 and 2009, the Corporation released
    $1.7 billion and $650 million of the valuation
    allowance attributable to Merrill Lynch s capital loss
    carryforward due to utilization against net capital gains
    realized in 2010 and 2009. The valuation allowance also
    increased due primarily to increases in operating loss
    carryforwards generated in certain state jurisdictions for which
    management believes it is more-likely-than-not that realization
    of these assets will not occur.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, U.S. federal income
    taxes had not been provided on $17.9 billion and
    $16.7 billion of undistributed earnings of
     non-U.S. subsidiaries 
    earned prior to 1987 and after 1997 that have been reinvested
    for an indefinite period of time. If the earnings were
    distributed, an additional $2.6 billion and
    $2.5 billion of tax expense, net of credits for
     non-U.S. taxes 
    paid on such earnings and for the related
     non-U.S. withholding 
    taxes, would have resulted as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

NOTE 22  Fair
    Value Measurements   

Under applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as
    the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid
    to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
    The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial
    instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under
    applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to
    maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three
    levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. For
    more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the
    Corporation measures fair value, see  Note 1  
    Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The
    Corporation accounts for certain corporate loans and loan
    commitments, LHFS, structured reverse repurchase agreements,
    long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value
    option. For more informations, see  Note 23  
    Fair Value Option .

Level 1, 2
    and 3 Valuation Techniques  

Financial instruments are considered Level 1 when the
    valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial
    instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or
    models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
    by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered
    Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing
    models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
    techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or
    input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation.

The Corporation uses market indices for direct inputs to certain
    models where the cash settlement is directly linked to
    appreciation or depreciation of that particular index (primarily
    in the context of structured credit products). In those cases,
    no material adjustments are made to the index-based values. In
    other cases, the use of market indices is inherently limited
    because the fair value of an individual position being valued
    may not move in tandem with changes in fair value of a specific
    market index. Accordingly, market indices are used as inputs to
    the valuation, but are adjusted for trade specific factors such
    as rating, credit quality, vintage and other factors.

Trading Account
    Assets and Liabilities and
     Available-for-Sale 
    Debt Securities  

The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are
    primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are
    based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.
    The fair values of AFS debt securities are generally based on
    quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets.
    Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the
    fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and AFS
    debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily
    available for some positions, or positions within a market
    sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or
    ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted
    cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the
    securities using internal credit risk, interest rate and
    prepayment risk models that incorporate management s best
    estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss
    severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows
    are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar
    instruments with adjustments that management believes a market
    participant would consider in determining fair value for the
    specific security. Others are valued using a net asset value
    approach which considers the value of the underlying securities.
    Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services,
    where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and
    ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by
    the market s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a
    single company or a specific market sector. In these instances,
    fair value is determined based on limited available market
    information and other factors, principally from reviewing the
    issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings
    made by one or more ratings agencies.

Derivative Assets
    and Liabilities  

The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in
    the
     over-the-counter 
    (OTC) market are determined using quantitative models that
    utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices
    and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and
    volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market
    inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external
    sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party
    pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative
    asset and liability positions that are either option-based or
    have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are
    less readily available or are unobservable, in which case,
    quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index
    scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values
    of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for
    market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other deal
    specific factors, where appropriate. The Corporation
    incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC
    derivatives the net credit differential between the counterparty
    credit risk and the Corporation s own credit risk. An
    estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination
    of fair value, primarily based on market data.

Corporate Loans
    and Loan Commitments  

The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on
    market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses
    using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments
    or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable
    borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow calculations may be
    adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or
    the perceived credit risk of the borrower.

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights  

The fair values of MSRs are determined using models that rely on
    estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted-average
    lives of the MSRs and

the OAS levels. For more information on MSRs, see
     Note 25   Mortgage Servicing Rights .

Loans
     Held-for-Sale   

The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where
    available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows
    using interest rates approximating the Corporation s
    current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect
    the inherent credit risk.

Other
    Assets  

The fair values of AFS marketable equity securities are
    generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for
    similar assets. However, non-public investments are initially
    valued at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted when
    evidence is available to support such adjustments.

Securities
    Financing Agreements  

The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,
    repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are
    determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash
    flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs
    including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous
    yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of
    market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through
    external sources, including brokers, market transactions and
    third-party pricing services.

Deposits,
    Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings  

The fair values of deposits, commercial paper and other
    short-term borrowings are determined using quantitative models,
    including discounted cash flow models that require the use of
    multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to
    generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility
    factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and
    can be validated through external sources, including brokers,
    market transactions and third-party pricing services. The
    Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spreads in
    the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is
    determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the
    secondary cash market.

Long-term
    Borrowings  

The Corporation issues structured notes that have coupons or
    repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity
    securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair value
    of structured notes is estimated using valuation models for the
    combined derivative and debt portions of the notes accounted for
    under the fair value option. These models incorporate observable
    and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security
    prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,
    commodity or equity rates and correlations between these inputs.
    The impact of the Corporation s own credit spreads is also
    included based on the Corporation s observed secondary bond
    market spreads.

Asset-backed
    Secured Financings  

The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on
    external broker bids, where available, or are determined by
    discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates
    approximating the Corporation s current origination rates
    for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

During 2010, the more significant transfers into Level 3
    included $3.2 billion of trading account assets,
    $3.5 billion of AFS debt securities, $1.1 billion of
    net derivative contracts and $1.9 billion of long-term
    debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets
    were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower
    levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate
    securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in
    valuation methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow
    model. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were
    due to an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other
    taxable securities priced using a discounted cash flow model.
    Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were
    primarily related to a lack of price observability for certain
    credit default and total return

swaps. Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 for
    long-term debt are primarily due to changes in the impact of
    unobservable inputs on the value of certain equity-linked
    structured notes.

During 2010, the more significant transfers out of Level 3
    were $3.4 billion of trading account assets and
    $1.8 billion of long-term debt. Transfers out of
    Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased
    price verification of certain mortgage-backed securities,
    corporate debt and
     non-U.S. government 
    and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for
    long-term debt were the result of a decrease in the significance
    of unobservable pricing inputs for certain equity-linked
    structured notes.

    in this Note. These assets and liabilities primarily include
    LHFS, unfunded loan commitments
     held-for-sale,

    Insurance  was $11.9 billion and $2.8 billion at
    December 31, 2010. See  Note 10   Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets  for additional information on the
    goodwill impairment charges. The amounts below represent only

NOTE 23  Fair
    Value Option   

Corporate Loans
    and Loan Commitments  

The Corporation elected to account for certain large corporate
    loans and loan commitments which exceeded the Corporation s
    single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair
    value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are
    actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, credit risk
    for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use
    of credit derivatives, with the Corporation s public side
    credit view and market perspectives determining the size and
    timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not
    meet the requirements for derivatives designated as accounting
    hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with changes in
    fair value recorded in other income (loss). Electing the fair
    value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and
    loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with
    management s view of the underlying economics and the
    manner in which they are managed. In addition, accounting for
    these loans and loan commitments at fair value reduces the
    accounting asymmetry that would otherwise result from carrying
    the loans at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair
    value.

Loans
     Held-for-Sale   

The Corporation elected to account for certain LHFS at fair
    value. Electing the fair value option allows a better offset of
    the changes in fair values of the

loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge
    them. The Corporation has not elected to account for other LHFS
    under the fair value option primarily because these loans are
    floating-rate loans that are not economically hedged using
    derivative instruments. Residential mortgage LHFS, commercial
    mortgage LHFS and other LHFS are accounted for under the fair
    value option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in
    other interest income. The changes in fair value are largely
    offset by hedging activities. An immaterial portion of these
    amounts was attributable to changes in instrument-specific
    credit risk.

Other
    Assets  

The Corporation elected to account for certain other assets
    under the fair value option including private equity investments.

Securities
    Financing Agreements  

The Corporation elected to account for certain securities
    financing agreements, including resale and repurchase
    agreements, under the fair value option based on the tenor of
    the agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the interest
    rate risk. The majority of securities financing agreements
    collateralized by U.S. government securities were excluded
    from the fair value option election as these contracts are
    generally short-dated and therefore the interest rate risk is
    not significant.

Long-term
    Deposits  

The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term
    fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits, which are economically
    hedged with derivatives, under the fair value option. Election
    of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the
    accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
    accounting asymmetry created by accounting for the financial
    instruments at historical cost and the economic hedges at fair
    value. The Corporation did not elect to carry other long-term
    deposits at fair value because they were not economically hedged
    using derivatives.

Commercial Paper
    and Other Short-term Borrowings  

The Corporation elected to account for certain commercial paper
    and other short-term borrowings under the fair value option.
    This debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.

Long-term
    Debt  

The Corporation elected to account for certain long-term debt,
    primarily structured notes that were acquired as part of the
    Merrill Lynch acquisition, under the fair value option. This
    long-term debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. Election
    of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the
    accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
    accounting asymmetry created by accounting for these financial
    instruments at historical cost and the related economic hedges
    at fair value.

Asset-backed
    Secured Financings  

The Corporation elected to account for certain asset-backed
    secured financings that were acquired as part of the Countrywide
    acquisition, which are classified in commercial paper and other
    short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of
    the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the
    accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the
    accounting asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed
    secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding
    mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value.

NOTE 24  Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments   

The fair values of financial instruments have been derived using
    methodologies described in  Note 22   Fair
    Value Measurements . The following disclosures include
    financial instruments where only a portion of the ending
    balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is carried at fair
    value on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Short-term
    Financial Instruments  

The carrying value of short-term financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed,
    federal funds sold and purchased, resale and certain repurchase
    agreements, commercial paper and other short-term investments
    and borrowings approximates the fair value of these instruments.
    These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to
    limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have
    short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate
    market. The Corporation elected to account for certain
    structured reverse repurchase agreements under the fair value
    option.

Loans  

Fair values were generally determined by discounting both
    principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected using
    an observable discount rate for similar instruments with
    adjustments that the Corporation believes a market participant
    would consider in determining fair value. The Corporation
    estimates the cash flows expected to be collected using internal
    credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that
    incorporate the Corporation s best estimate of current key
    assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment
    speeds for the life of the loan. The carrying value of loans is
    presented net of the applicable allowance for loan and lease
    losses and excludes leases. The Corporation elected to account
    for certain large corporate loans which exceeded the
    Corporation s single name credit risk concentration
    guidelines under the fair value option.

Deposits  

The fair value for certain deposits with stated maturities was
    determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current
    market rates for instruments with similar maturities. The
    carrying value of
     non-U.S. time 
    deposits approximates fair value. For deposits with no stated
    maturities, the carrying amount was considered to approximate
    fair value and does not take into account the significant value
    of the cost advantage and stability of the Corporation s
    long-term relationships with depositors. The Corporation
    accounts for certain long-term fixed-rate deposits which are
    economically hedged with derivatives under the fair value option.

Long-term
    Debt  

The Corporation uses quoted market prices, when available, to
    estimate fair value for its long-term debt. When quoted market
    prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on
    current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with
    similar terms and maturities. The Corporation accounts for
    certain structured notes under the fair value option.

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments  

The carrying values and fair values of certain financial
    instruments that are not carried at fair value at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the table below.

NOTE 25  Mortgage
    Servicing Rights   

The Corporation accounts for consumer MSRs at fair value with
    changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income in mortgage banking income. The Corporation economically
    hedges these MSRs with certain derivatives and securities
    including MBS and U.S. Treasuries. The securities that
    economically hedge the MSRs are classified in other assets with
    changes in the fair value of the securities and the related
    interest income recorded in mortgage banking income.

The table below presents activity for residential first mortgage
    MSRs for 2010 and 2009.

(1)   

These amounts reflect the change in
    discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to
    changes in interest rates, as well as the effect of changes in
    other assumptions.

The Corporation uses an OAS valuation approach to determine the
    fair value of MSRs which factors in prepayment risk. This
    approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under
    multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash
    flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key economic
    assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented below.

232        Bank
    of America 2010

Table of Contents   

The table below presents the sensitivity of the weighted-average
    lives and fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions.
    These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with
    caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on
    variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated
    because the relationship of the change in assumption to the
    change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a
    variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs
    that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated
    without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in
    one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify
    or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not
    reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate
    such risk.

Commercial and residential reverse mortgage MSRs, which are
    carried at the lower of cost or market value and accounted for
    using the amortization method, totaled $278 million and
    $309 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and are
    not included in the table below.

NOTE 26  Business
    Segment Information   

The Corporation reports the results of its operations through
    six business segments:  Deposits, Global Card Services, Home
    Loans   Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, Global
    Banking   Markets (GBAM)  and  Global
    Wealth   Investment Management (GWIM) , with the
    remaining operations recorded in  All Other . Effective
    January 1, 2010, the Corporation realigned the Global
    Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former  Global
    Banking  business segment with the former  Global Markets
     business segment to form  GBAM  and to reflect
     Global Commercial Banking  as a standalone segment. In
    addition, the Corporation may periodically reclassify business
    segment results based on modifications to its management
    reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment.
    Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    current period presentation.

Deposits  

Deposits  includes the results of consumer deposits
    activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products
    provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition,
     Deposits  includes an allocation of ALM activities.
    Deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money
    market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and
    interest-bearing checking accounts. These products provide a
    relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. The
    Corporation earns net interest spread revenue from investing
    this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending
    and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit
    products using a funds transfer pricing

process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity
    characteristics of the deposits.  Deposits  also generates
    fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees,
    overdraft charges and ATM fees. In addition,  Deposits
     includes the net impact of migrating customers and their
    related deposit balances between  GWIM  and
     Deposits . Subsequent to the date of migration, the
    associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest
    expense are recorded in the business to which deposits were
    transferred.

Global Card
    Services  

Global Card Services  provides a broad offering of
    products including U.S. consumer and business card,
    consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers
    and small businesses. The Corporation reports its  Global Card
    Services  current period results in accordance with new
    consolidation guidance that was effective on January 1,
    2010. Under this new consolidation guidance, the Corporation
    consolidated all previously unconsolidated credit card trusts.
    Accordingly, current year results are comparable to prior year
    results that were presented on a managed basis, which was
    consistent with the way that management evaluated the results of
    the business. Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were
    not sold and presented earnings on these loans in a manner
    similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held
    loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative
    funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify
    funding sources.  Global Card Services  managed income
    statement line items differ from a held basis as follows:
    managed net interest income includes  Global Card Services
     net interest income on held loans and interest income on the
    securitized loans less the internal funds transfer pricing
    allocation related to securitized loans; managed noninterest
    income includes  Global Card Services  noninterest income
    on a held basis less the reclassification of certain components
    of card income (e.g., excess servicing income) to record
    securitized net interest income and provision for credit losses;
    and provision for credit losses represents the provision for
    credit losses on held loans combined with realized credit losses
    associated with the securitized loan portfolio.

Home
    Loans   Insurance  

Home Loans   Insurance  provides an extensive
    line of consumer real estate products and services to customers
    nationwide.  Home Loans   Insurance  products
    include fixed and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for
    home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home
    equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage
    products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to
    investors while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer
    relationships, or are held on the Corporation s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for ALM purposes and reported in
     All Other. Home Loans   Insurance  is not
    impacted by the Corporation s first mortgage production
    retention decisions as  Home Loans   Insurance
     is compensated for the decision on a management accounting
    basis with a corresponding offset recorded in  All Other .
    Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are
    held on the Corporation s Consolidated Balance Sheet. In
    addition,  Home Loans   Insurance  offers
    property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance.
     Home Loans   Insurance  also includes the impact
    of migrating customers and their related loan balances between
     GWIM  and  Home Loans   Insurance  based on
    client segmentation thresholds. Subsequent to the date of
    migration, the associated net interest income and noninterest
    expense are recorded in the business segment to which loans were
    transferred.

    and their related deposit and loan balances to or from  GWIM
     and  Deposits, Home Loans   Insurance  and
    the Corporation s ALM activities. Subsequent to the date of
    migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest
    income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to
    which the clients migrated.

All
    Other  

All Other  consists of equity investment activities
    including Global Principal Investments, Strategic Investments,
    the residential mortgage portfolio associated with ALM
    activities, the impact of the cost allocation processes, merger

and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, and the
    results of certain businesses that are expected to be or have
    been sold or are in the process of being liquidated.  All
    Other  also includes certain amounts associated with ALM
    activities, amounts associated with the change in the value of

    whole mortgage loans, gains (losses) on sales of debt
    securities, OTTI write-downs on certain AFS securities and for
    periods prior to January 1, 2010, a securitization offset
    which removed the securitization impact of sold loans in
     Global Card Services  in order to present the consolidated
    results of the Corporation on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis).

Basis of
    Presentation  

The management accounting and reporting process derives segment
    and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for
    revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses
    is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an
    activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other
    methodologies and assumptions management believes are
    appropriate to reflect the results of the business.

Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest
    income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis and noninterest
    income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis
    results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The
    segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense
    methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net
    interest income of the businesses includes the results of a
    funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and
    liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity
    characteristics. For presentation purposes, in segments where
    the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are
    generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates
    assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business
    segments also includes an allocation of net interest income
    generated by the Corporation s ALM activities.

The Corporation s ALM activities include an overall
    interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use
    of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings
    that are caused by interest rate volatility. The
    Corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity
    so that movements in interest rates do not significantly
    adversely affect net interest income. The Corporation s ALM
    activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate
    based on performance. ALM activities include external product
    pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the
    effects of the Corporation s internal funds transfer
    pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.

Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific
    business segment are allocated to the segments. The most
    significant of these expenses include data and item processing
    costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data
    processing costs are allocated to the segments based on
    equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the
    segments based on the volume of items processed for each
    segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions
    are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.

Since the Corporation s operations are highly integrated,
    certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts must be
    allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of
    interest expense, income (loss) before income taxes and net
    income (loss) by geographic area. The Corporation identifies its
    geographic performance based on the business unit structure used
    to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region as
    applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the
    allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately
    matched with the related expense or capital deployed in the
    region.

    America Corporation s (the  Corporation )
    assertion, included under Item 9A, that the
    Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of December 31, 2010 ( Management s
    Assertion ). Disclosure controls and procedures mean
    controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission s rules and forms, and that information required
    to be disclosed by an issuer in reports that it files or submits
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and
    communicated to the issuer s management, including its
    principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons
    performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. The Corporation s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective disclosure
    controls and procedures and for Management s Assertion of
    the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on Management s
    Assertion based on our examination.

There are inherent limitations to disclosure controls and
    procedures. Because of these inherent limitations, effective
    disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
    assurance of achieving the intended objectives. Disclosure
    controls and procedures may not prevent, or detect and correct,
    material misstatements, and they may not identify all
    information relating to the Corporation to be accumulated and
    communicated to the Corporation s management to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Also,
    projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods

are subject to the risk that disclosure controls and procedures
    may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
    the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

We conducted our examination in accordance with attestation
    standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether effective disclosure controls and procedures were
    maintained in all material respects. Our examination included
    obtaining an understanding of the Corporation s disclosure
    controls and procedures and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure
    controls and procedures based on the assessed risk. Our
    examination also included performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
    examination was not conducted for the purpose of expressing an
    opinion, and accordingly we express no opinion, on the accuracy
    or completeness of the Corporation s disclosures in its
    reports, or whether such disclosures comply with the rules and
    regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In our opinion, Management s Assertion that the
    Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of December 31, 2010 is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in  Internal
    Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Other
    Information  

On February 24, 2011, the Board approved amendments to the
    Corporation s Bylaws that provide for the number of
    directors to be established by resolution of the Board as well
    as other non-substantive changes, such as updating the names of
    the Board committees. The prior Bylaw provision stated that the
    number of directors would be no less than five nor more than 30
    with the minimum and maximum to be established by the Board. The
    description of the

Amended and Restated Bylaws does not purport to be complete and
    is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and
    Restated Bylaws, which are attached as Exhibit 3(b) to this
    report.

On February 24, 2011, the company and Brian T. Moynihan,
    President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a
    non-exclusive aircraft time sharing agreement (the
     Agreement ), which will permit Mr. Moynihan to
    lease the company s aircraft for his use. Mr. Moynihan
    will pay the company for such use of the aircraft pursuant to
    the terms of the Agreement, provided such payment does not
    exceed the maximum amount allowed under Federal Aviation
    Administration regulations. The Agreement automatically renews
    each year and each party shall have the right to terminate the
    Agreement at anytime with 30 days  written notice to
    the other party. The Agreement also shall terminate immediately
    if Mr. Moynihan no longer serves as the company s
    Chief Executive Officer. The company and Pilot In Command retain
    the authority to determine what flights may be scheduled under
    the Agreement and when a flight may be cancelled or changed for
    safety reasons. The description of the Agreement does not
    purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
    reference to the Agreement, which is attached as
    Exhibit 10(jjj) to this report.

The following table presents information on equity compensation
    plans at December 31, 2010:

(1)   

This table does not include
    outstanding options to purchase 9,365,888 shares of the
    Corporation s common stock that were assumed by the
    Corporation in connection with prior acquisitions, under whose
    plans the options were originally granted. The weighted-average
    option price of these assumed options was $87.21 at
    December 31, 2010. Also, at December 31, 2010 there
    were 216,956 vested deferred restricted stock units associated
    with these plans. No additional awards were granted under these
    plans following the respective dates of acquisition.

(2)   

This table does not include
    outstanding options to purchase 9,560,763 shares of the
    Corporation s common stock that were assumed by the
    Corporation in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition,
    which were originally issued under certain Merrill Lynch plans.
    The weighted-average option price of these assumed options was
    $56.85 at December 31, 2010. Also, at December 31,
    2010 there were 18,985,432 outstanding restricted stock units
    and 1,760,307 vested deferred restricted stock units and stock
    option gain deferrals associated with such plans. These Merrill
    Lynch plans were frozen at the time of the acquisition and no
    additional awards may be granted under these plans. However, as
    previously approved by the Corporation s shareholders, if
    any of the outstanding awards under these frozen plans
    subsequently are cancelled, forfeited or settled in cash, the
    shares relating to such awards thereafter will be available for
    future awards issued under the Corporation s Key Associate
    Stock Plan (KASP).

(3)   

Includes 160,534,411 outstanding
    restricted stock units and 117,363 vested deferred restricted
    stock units under plans approved by the Corporation s
    shareholders and 28,521,170 outstanding restricted stock units
    under plans not approved by the Corporation s shareholders.

(4)   

Does not reflect restricted stock
    units included in the first column, which do not have an
    exercise price.

(5)   

Includes 522,081,106 shares of
    common stock available for future issuance under the KASP
    (including 20,875,047 shares originally subject to awards
    outstanding under frozen Merrill Lynch plans at the time of the
    acquisition which subsequently have been cancelled, forfeited or
    settled in cash and become available for issuance under the
    KASP, as described in note (2) above) and
    678,465 shares of common stock which are available for
    future issuance under the Corporation s Directors 
    Stock Plan.

(6)   

In connection with the Merrill
    Lynch acquisition, the Corporation assumed and has continued to
    issue awards in accordance with applicable NYSE listing
    standards under the following plans, which were not approved by
    the Corporation s shareholders: the Merrill Lynch Employee
    Stock Compensation Plan (ESCP) and the Merrill Lynch Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), both of which were approved by
    Merrill Lynch s shareholders prior to the acquisition. The
    material features of these plans are described below under the
    heading  Description of Plans Not Approved by the
    Corporation s Shareholders. 

(7)   

This amount includes
    60,189,074 shares of common stock available for future
    issuance under the ESCP and 9,444,696 shares of common
    stock available for future issuance under the ESPP.

Description of
    Plans Not Approved by the Corporation s
    Shareholders  

Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Compensation Plan
     (ESCP).  The ESCP covers associates who were
    salaried key employees of Merrill Lynch or its subsidiaries
    immediately prior to the effective date of the Merrill Lynch
    acquisition, other than executive officers. Under the ESCP, the
    Corporation may award restricted shares, restricted units,
    incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and stock
    appreciation rights. Awards of restricted shares and restricted
    units are subject to a vesting schedule specified in the grant
    documentation. Restricted shares and restricted units under the
    ESCP may generally be cancelled prior to the vesting date in the
    event of (i) violation of covenants specified in the grant
    documentation (including, but not limited to, non-competition,
    non-solicitation, nondisparagement and confidentiality

covenants) or (ii) termination of employment prior to the
    end of the vesting period (except in certain limited
    circumstances, such as death, disability and retirement).
    Options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
    the stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the ESCP
    expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, and
    the applicable grant documentation specifies the extent to which
    options may be exercised during their respective terms,
    including in the event of an associate s death, disability
    or termination of employment. Shares that are cancelled,
    forfeited or settled in cash from an additional frozen Merrill
    Lynch plan also will become available for grant under the ESCP.

Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     (ESPP).  The purpose of the ESPP is to give
    associates employed by Merrill Lynch or an eligible subsidiary
    an opportunity to purchase the Corporation s common stock
    through payroll

    of America 2010

deductions (an employee can elect either payroll deductions of
    one percent to 10 percent of current compensation or an
    annual dollar amount equal to a maximum of 10 percent of
    current eligible compensation). Shares are purchased quarterly
    at 95 percent of the fair market value (average of the
    highest and lowest share prices) on the date of the purchase and
    the maximum annual contribution is $23,750. An associate is
    eligible to participate if he or she was employed by Merrill
    Lynch or any participating subsidiary for at least
    12 months prior to the start of the new plan year.

Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or by the Secretary acting under instructions of
the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President,

revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to
the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation.

(c) Calling of a Special Meeting. The Secretary shall not be required to call a special
meeting of Stockholders if (i) the Board of Directors calls an annual or special meeting of
Stockholders to be held not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which a valid Special
Meeting Request or Stockholder Special Meeting Requests have been delivered to the Secretary (the
 Delivery Date  or (ii) the Special Meeting Request or the Stockholder Special Meeting Request
(A) is received by the Secretary during the period commencing seventy-five (75) days prior to the
first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of
the next annual meeting; (B)contains an identical or substantially similar item (a  Similar Item )
to an item that was presented at any meeting of Stockholders held within one hundred and twenty
(120) days prior to the Delivery Date (and, for purposes of this clause (B) the election of
directors shall be deemed a  Similar Item  with respect to all items of business involving the
election or removal of directors); (C) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject
for action by the party requesting the special meeting under applicable law; (D) was made in a
manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law;
or (E) does not comply with the provisions of this Section 2. The Secretary may call a special
meeting of Stockholders at any time as requested by any government or regulatory agency.

(d) Holding a Special Meeting. Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting
shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with
these Bylaws and the DGCL. In the case of a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, such meeting
shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however,
that the date of any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be not more than sixty (60) days
after the record date for such meeting (the  Meeting Record Date ), which shall be fixed in
accordance with Article III, Section 5 of these Bylaws; provided further that, if the Board of
Directors fails to designate, within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, a date and time for a
Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 9:00 a.m. local time on
the 60th day after the Meeting Record Date (or, if that day shall not be a business day, then on
the next preceding business day); and provided further that in the event that the Board of
Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting within ten (10)
days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the Corporation s principal
executive offices. In fixing a date and time for any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting the
Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of
business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of

3 

the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting
and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.

(e) Business Transacted at a Special Meeting. Business to be transacted at a special meeting
may only be brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting. Business
transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated
in the Stockholder Special Meeting Request(s); provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to the Stockholders at any Stockholder
Requested Special Meeting.

Section 3.  Place of Meeting . The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer or the President of the Corporation, or the Secretary acting under instructions
of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President,
shall designate any place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the place of meeting
for any annual meeting of Stockholders or for any special meeting of Stockholders.

Section 4.  Notice to Stockholders . Except as otherwise provided herein or required by law,
whenever Stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice
of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting,
the means of remote communications, if any, by which the Stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any notice to Stockholders shall be effective
if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder in the manner and to
the extent permitted by the DGCL.

The written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice may be given to Stockholders sharing an address in the manner
and to the extent permitted by the DGCL. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the Stockholder at such Stockholder s address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 5.  Fixing of Record Date . For the purpose of determining Stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or Stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or in order to make a
determination of Stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in
advance a date for any such determination of Stockholders, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which date in any case

4 

to be not more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of Stockholders, not less than ten days prior
to, the date of such meeting or on which such action is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for
the determination of Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders, or
for determination of the Stockholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or other
distribution or any other purpose, the close of business on the day before the first notice is
given shall be the record date. When a determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at any
meeting of Stockholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply
to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date.

Section 6.  Stockholders List . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before the meeting of Stockholders, a
complete list of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each Stockholder and the number of Shares registered in the name of each
Stockholder. The list of Stockholders shall be open to the examination of any Stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting during
ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation, or the Corporation
may place the Stockholder s list on a reasonably accessible electronic network as permitted by the
DGCL. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting and be available for
inspection by any Stockholder who is present at the meeting.

Section 7.  Quorum . A majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of Stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is
required, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the outstanding shares of such class or
series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. In the absence of a quorum, such
meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the approval of the majority of the voting power of
the outstanding shares present and entitled to vote at the meeting, even if less than a quorum.
Once a quorum is present at a meeting, it is deemed present for the remainder of the meeting and
for any adjournment of that meeting, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Stockholders to leave
less than a quorum.

Section 8.  Proxies . Each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another
person or persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

Without limiting the manner in which a Stockholder may authorize another person or persons to
act for such Stockholder as proxy pursuant to the previous paragraph, the following shall
constitute a valid means by which a Stockholder may grant such authority:

(1) A Stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act
for such Stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the Stockholder or such
Stockholder s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or
causing such person s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means
including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

5 

(2) A Stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder
as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other
means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a
proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by
the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth
or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the Stockholder. If it is
determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the
inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination
shall specify the information upon which they relied.

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or
transmission created pursuant to the previous paragraph of this section may be substituted
or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which
the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
original writing or transmission.

A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and
only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is
coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.

Section 9.  Voting of Shares . Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, each outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter voted
on at a Stockholders meeting. Other Shares are entitled to vote only as provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation or the DGCL. If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than election of
directors or the Chairman of a meeting) is approved if the votes cast favoring an action exceed the
votes cast opposing the action, unless the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL requires a
greater number of affirmative votes. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or
series is required, the approval of the majority of the votes entitled to be cast within such class
or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be
the act of such class or series or classes or series. Such class or series or classes or series
shall not be entitled to vote separately unless expressly required by the Certificate of
Incorporation or as otherwise provided in the DGCL.

Section 10.  Required Vote for Directors . A nominee for director shall be elected to the
Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee s election exceed the votes cast against such
nominee s election; provided, however, that the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast at any meeting of Stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a
notice that a Stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in
compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in
Article III, Section 12 of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such
Stockholder on or prior to the tenth day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice
of meeting for such meeting to the Stockholders. If no nominees for election to the Board

6 

of Directors are elected at an annual meeting, a special meeting of Stockholders shall be called
for an election of directors in the manner provided in Article III, Section 2 of these Bylaws.

Section 11.  Conduct of Meetings . The Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman at
each meeting of Stockholders or, in the Chairman s absence, the Chief Executive Officer shall so
preside. At the request of the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, in both their
absences, such other officer as the Board of Directors shall designate shall so preside at any such
meeting. In the absence of a presiding officer determined in accordance with the preceding
sentence, any person may be designated to so preside at a Stockholders meeting by a plurality vote
of the Shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. The Secretary or, in the absence or
at the request of the Secretary, any person designated by the person presiding at a Stockholders
meeting shall act as secretary of such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of Stockholders shall
determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including regulation of the
manner of voting, the conduct of discussion, and the propriety of any proposal brought before the
meeting. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the
Stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting.

Section 12.  Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations . At any meeting of the
Stockholders, only nominations for the election of directors and the proposal of other business to
be considered that has been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 12 may be conducted. Nominations for the election of directors and the
proposal of other business at an annual meeting may be made only: (a) pursuant to the Corporation s
notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto); (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or any committee thereof; or (c) by a stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of
record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 12 is delivered to
the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with
this Section 12.

For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder
pursuant to clause (c) of the above paragraph of this Section 12, the stockholder must have given
timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business
other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a
proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder s notice shall be delivered to
the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the seventy-fifth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting (provided,
however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or
more than seventy days after its anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the seventy-fifth day prior to
such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of
such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above.

Any notice by a stockholder shall set forth:

7 

(a) 
       
     the name and address of the stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on
whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, as they appear on the Corporation s
books; 

(b) 
       
     a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of the
Corporation s stock (including the number and class of shares which are owned
beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner), entitled to
vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
propose such business or nomination 

(c) 
       
     whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of
transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding (including any short positions or any borrowing or lending
of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to
or manage risk of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power
of, such stockholder or any such beneficial owner with respect to any share of stock of
the Corporation; 

(d) 
       
     a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any,
intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or
form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation s outstanding
capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b)
otherwise to solicit proxies from Stockholders in support of such proposal or
nomination; 

(e) 
       
     as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a
director, a description of all arrangements or understandings among the stockholder or
the beneficial owner, if any, and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming
such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made
by the stockholder, and such person s written consent to being named in the proxy
statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; 

(f) 
       
     as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a
director, all information regarding each nominee that would be required to be disclosed
in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest pursuant
to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; and 

(g) 
       
     as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting,
the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed
for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the
Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for
conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such 

8 

business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made. 

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of
the Corporation.

Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of the second paragraph of this Section 12 to
the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of
the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the
Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred twenty (120)
days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, a stockholder s notice
required by this Section 12 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for
the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day
on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of Stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting. Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of Stockholders at which
directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting (1) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or (2) provided that the Board of
Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 12
is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon
such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 12. In the
event the Corporation calls a special meeting of Stockholders for the purpose of electing one or
more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of
directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as
specified in the Corporation s notice of meeting, if the stockholder s notice required by the
second paragraph of this Section 12 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the
Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty
(a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
12 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination
or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the
case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder s nominee or proposal

9 

in compliance with such stockholder s representation as required by clause (d) above of this
Section 12) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance
with this Section 12, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed
business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12,
unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the
stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation to
present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed
business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 12, to be considered a qualified
representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner
of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an
electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the
meeting of Stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a
reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of Stockholders.
In the event that a qualified representative of the stockholder will appear at the annual or
special meeting of Stockholders to present a nomination or proposed business, the stockholder must
provide notice of the designation, including the identity of the representative, to the Corporation
at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to such meeting. Where a stockholder fails to provide such
notice of designation to the Corporation within the required timeframe, such stockholder must
appear in person to present his, her or its nomination or proposed business at the annual or
special meeting or such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be
transacted as provided for above.

For purposes of this Section 12,  public announcement  shall include disclosure in a press
release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news
service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a stockholder seeking to include
a proposal in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies shall
comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 12. Nothing in this Section 12
shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of Stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to
any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

ARTICLE IV 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

Section 1.  General Powers . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
under the direction of its Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or permitted under the DGCL.

Section 2.  Number and Qualifications . The number of directors of the Corporation shall be
fixed or changed from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Directors

10 

need not be residents of the State of Delaware or Stockholders of the Corporation. A director of
the Corporation shall at all times meet all statutory and regulatory qualifications for a director
of a publicly held bank holding company and financial holding company.

Section 3.  Terms of Directors . The terms of all directors shall expire at the next annual
Stockholders meeting following their election. A decrease in the number of directors does not
shorten an incumbent director s term. The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy shall expire
at the next Stockholders meeting at which directors are elected. Despite the expiration of a
director s term, however, such director shall continue to serve until the director s successor is
elected and qualified or until such director s earlier resignation or removal. Any director may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding Shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Section 4.  Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships . Except in those instances where the
Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law provides otherwise, a majority of directors then in
office, although less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director, may fill a vacancy or a newly
created directorship on the Board of Directors. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date
(by reason of a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise) may be filled before the
vacancy occurs by a majority of directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, but
the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

Section 5.  Compensation . The Board of Directors may provide for the compensation of
directors for their services as such and may provide for the payment or reimbursement of any or all
expenses reasonably incurred by them in attending meetings of the Board or of any committee of the
Board or in the performance of their other duties as directors. Nothing herein contained, however,
shall prevent any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity or receiving
compensation therefor.

Section 6.  Executive Committee . The Board of Directors may designate four or more directors
who shall constitute the Executive Committee of the Corporation. The Executive Committee, between
meetings of the Board of Directors and subject to such limitations as may be required by law or
imposed by resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all of the authority
of the Board of Directors in the management of the Corporation.
Meetings of the Executive Committee may be held at any time on call of its Chairman or any two
members of the Committee. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum at all meetings. The
Executive Committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings and shall report its actions to the next
succeeding meeting of the Board of Directors.

Section 7.  Other Committees . The Board of Directors may from time to time create or
eliminate one or more other committees, including but not limited to Audit, Compensation and
Benefits, Corporate Governance, Credit and Enterprise Risk committees, and appoint members of the
Board of Directors to serve on them. Each committee must have one or more members who serve at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall periodically approve a charter
describing the duties of each committee. The provisions of the DGCL and these Bylaws that govern
meetings, action without meetings, notice and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements
of the Board of Directors, shall apply to committees and their

11 

members as well. To the extent specified by the Board of Directors, each committee may exercise the
authority of the Board of Directors, except as to the matters which the DGCL specifically excepts
from the authority of such committees. Nothing contained in this Section shall preclude the Board
of Directors from establishing and appointing any committee, whether of directors or otherwise, not
having or exercising the authority of the Board of Directors.

ARTICLE V 

MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS 

Section 1.  Regular Meetings . A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held
without other notice than this Bylaw provision immediately after, and at the same place as, the
annual meeting of the Stockholders. In addition, the Board of Directors may provide, by resolution,
the date, time and place for the holding of additional regular meetings.

Section 2.  Special Meetings . Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any
date, time and place upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the

Executive Officer or the President, or upon the call of any three directors. Special meetings may

unless otherwise required by the DGCL.

12 

Section 4.  Waiver of Notice . A director may waive any notice required by the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the
notice. The waiver must be in writing, signed by the director entitled to the notice, and filed
with the minutes or corporate records, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing requirement of
written notice, a director s attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice
to the director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting expressly
objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 5.  Quorum . A majority of the number of directors in office immediately before the
meeting begins, but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of directors fixed by the Board of
Directors, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of
Directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of directors present
may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

Section 6.  Manner of Acting . Except as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation or herein, the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

Section 7.  Conduct of Meetings . The Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer shall preside
at all meetings of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that in the absence or at the request
of the Chairman of the Board, or if there shall not be a person holding such offices, the person
selected to preside at a meeting of directors by a vote of a majority of the directors present
shall preside at such meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence or at the request of the Secretary,
any person designated by the person presiding at a meeting of the Board of Directors, shall act as

committee designated by the Board of Directors may participate in a Board of Directors or committee
meeting by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all

Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer, a President, one or more Vice Chairmen, one or
more Division Presidents, one or more Executive Vice Presidents, one or more Senior Vice
Presidents, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and such other officers,
assistant or deputy officers and agents, as may be elected from time to time by or under the
authority of the Board of Directors. The same individual may simultaneously hold more than one
office in the Corporation, but no individual may act in more than one capacity where action of two
or more officers is required. The title of any officer may include any additional designation
descriptive of such officer s duties as the Board of Directors may prescribe.

Section 2.  Appointment and Term . The officers of the Corporation shall be elected by the
Board of Directors or by a committee or an officer authorized by the Board of Directors or a
committee to elect one or more officers; provided, however, that no officer may be authorized to
elect the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. Each officer shall
hold office until his or her death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification or until
such officer s successor is elected and qualified.

Section 3.  Compensation . The compensation of all officers of the Corporation shall be fixed
by or under the authority of the Board of Directors. No officer shall be prevented from receiving
such salary by reason of the fact that such officer is also a director.

Section 4.  Resignation and Removal of Officers . An officer may resign at any time by
communicating such officer s resignation to the Corporation. A resignation is effective when it is
communicated unless it specifies in writing a later effective date. If a resignation is made
effective at a later date and the Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board of
Directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board of Directors provides
that the successor does not take office until the effective date. The Board of Directors, by the
affirmative vote of a majority of its members, may remove the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer or the President whenever in its judgment the best interest of the Corporation
would be served thereby. In addition, the Board of Directors or a committee or an officer
authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee may remove any other officer at any
time with or without cause.

Section 5.  Contract Rights of Officers . The appointment of an officer does not itself
create contract rights. An officer s removal does not itself affect the officer s contract rights,
if any, with the Corporation, and an officer s resignation does not itself affect the Corporation s
contract rights, if any, with the officer.

Section 6.  Chief Executive Officer . The Board of Directors may elect a Chief Executive
Officer. The Chief Executive Officer shall, subject to the direction and control of the Board of
Directors, supervise and control the business and affairs of the Corporation. In general the Chief

as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these Bylaws from time to time.

Section 7.  Chairman of the Board . The Board of Directors may elect from among its members
an officer designated as the Chairman of the Board, but the appointment of a Chairman of the Board
shall not be required. If a Chairman of the Board shall be elected, then the Chairman of the Board
shall have such other duties and authority as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time
to time. In general the Chairman of the Board shall perform all duties incident to the position of
chairman of the board or as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these Bylaws from time
to time.

The Chairman of the Board shall be a director who is independent from the Corporation. For
purposes of this Bylaw,  independent  has the meaning set forth in the New York Stock Exchange
( NYSE ) listing standards, unless the Corporation s common stock ceases to be listed on the NYSE
and is listed on another exchange, in which case such exchange s definition of independence shall
apply. If the Board of Directors determines that a Chairman who was independent at the time he or
she was selected is no longer independent, the Board of Directors shall select a new Chairman who
satisfies the requirements of this Bylaw within 60 days of such determination. Compliance with this
Bylaw shall be excused if no director who qualifies as independent is elected by the Stockholders
or if no director who is independent is willing to serve as Chairman of the Board. This Bylaw shall
apply prospectively, so as not to violate any contractual obligation of the Corporation in effect
when this Bylaw was adopted.

Section 8.  President . The Board of Directors may elect a President. The President shall
perform the duties and exercise the powers of that office and, in addition, the President shall
perform such other duties and shall have such other authority as the Board of Directors shall
prescribe. In general the President shall perform all duties incident to the position of president
or as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these Bylaws from time to time. The Board of
Directors shall, if it deems such action necessary or desirable, designate the officer of the
Corporation who is to perform the duties of the President in the event of such officer s absence or
inability to act.

Section 9.  Vice Chairman . The Board of Directors may elect one or more officers designated
as the Vice Chairman, but the appointment of one or more Vice Chairmen shall not be required. If
one or more Vice Chairmen shall be elected, then one or more Vice Chairmen shall have such duties
and authority as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to time.

Section 10.  Division Presidents . The Board of Directors may appoint one or more officers
designated as Division Presidents, but the appointment of one or more Division Presidents shall not
be required. If one or more Division Presidents shall be appointed, then the Division President(s)
shall have such duties and authority as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors from time to
time.

Section 11.  Managing Directors and Vice Presidents . The Board of Directors may appoint one
or more Managing Directors and one or more Vice Presidents. Categories of Vice Presidents may
include, but are not limited to, Group Executive Vice Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents,

15 

Senior Vice Presidents, and Assistant Vice Presidents. The Board of Directors may create categories
of Managing Directors. Each Managing Director and each Vice President shall have such duties and
authorities as may be described by the Board of Directors or by the officer to whom such Managing
Director or Vice President reports.

Section 12.  Secretary . The Secretary shall keep the minutes of meetings of the Stockholders
and of the Board of Directors and be custodian of the corporate records, and in general perform all
duties incident to the office of the secretary and such other duties as from time to time may be
assigned to the Secretary by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors or a committee
created by the Board of Directors.

Section 13.  Treasurer . The Treasurer shall have charge and custody of all funds and
securities of the Corporation, and in general perform all of the duties incident to the office of

Section 1.  Shares . Shares of the Corporation may but need not be represented by
certificates. Upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a
certificate. When Shares are represented by certificates, the Corporation shall issue such
certificates in such form as shall be required by the DGCL and as determined by the Board of
Directors, to every Stockholder for the fully paid Shares owned by such Stockholder. Each
certificate shall be signed by the Chairman, or a Vice Chairman of the Board, or the President, or

in place of a certificate claimed to have been lost, destroyed or mutilated, upon receipt of an
affidavit of such fact from the persons claiming the loss or destruction and any other
documentation satisfactory to the Board of Directors or such officer. At the discretion of the
party reviewing such claim, any such claimant may be required to give the Corporation a bond in
such sum as it may direct to indemnify against the loss from any claim with respect to the
certificate claimed to have been lost or destroyed.

Section 4.  Holder of Record . Except as otherwise required by the DGCL, the Corporation may
treat the person in whose name the Shares stand of record on its books as the absolute owner of the
Shares and the person exclusively entitled to receive notification and distributions, to vote, and
to otherwise exercise the rights, powers and privileges of ownership of such Shares.

Section 5.  Transfer Agent and Registrar; Regulations . The Corporation may, if and whenever
the Board of Directors so determines, maintain in the State of Delaware or any other state of the
United States, one or more transfer offices or agencies and also one or more registry offices,

stock of the Corporation in respect of which a Transfer Agent and Registrar shall have been
designated shall be valid unless countersigned by such Transfer Agent and registered by such
Registrar. Any such countersignature may be a facsimile. The Board may also make such additional
rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of
certificates.

ARTICLE VIII 

INDEMNIFICATION 

Section 1.  Right to Indemnification  .  Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a  proceeding ), by reason of
the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, manager or employee of an
Affiliate or of another corporation, association, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an  indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, manager, or employee or agent, shall be vested with the contractual
right to indemnification and be held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized
by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and
loss

17 

(including attorneys  fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith if the
indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interest of the Corporation or other entity covered by this Article VIII, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that
indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. Such indemnification shall not be retroactively amended to
adversely affect the rights of an indemnitee in connection with any act, omissions, facts or
circumstances occurring prior to the date of amendment, shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in
Section 3 of this Article VIII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification,
the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. This Article shall supercede any conflicting provisions
contained in the corporate governance documents of any Affiliate of the Corporation.

Section 2.  Right to Advancement of Expenses . The right to indemnification conferred in this
Article shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding for which such right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an  advancement of expenses  provided, however, that an advancement of
expenses incurred by an indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking (hereinafter an  Undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which
there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a  final adjudication ) that such indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise.

Section 3.  Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit . The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, as limited by Section 7
hereof, are contract rights. If a claim under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in
full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,
except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period
shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a
suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
Undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Corporation shall
be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors
or independent legal counsel) that the indemnitee

18 

has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has
not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
Article or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 4.  Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws, agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 5.  Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or any person serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of another
corporation, association, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Section 6.  Indemnification of Agents of the Corporation . The Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the
advancement of expenses to any agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of
this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers of the Corporation.

Section 7.  Limitations on Indemnification . All indemnification and insurance provisions
contained in this Article VIII are subject to the limitations and prohibitions imposed by federal
law, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and any
implementing regulations concerning indemnification.

ARTICLE IX

Exhibit 10(c) 

OFFICER S CERTIFICATE OF GLOBAL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS AND 
SHARED SERVICES EXECUTIVE 
REGARDING WANGER DIVESTITURE 

The undersigned, Mark S. Behnke, the Global Compensation, Benefits and Shared Services Executive of
Bank of America Corporation (the  Corporation ), hereby certifies, determines and resolves that:

1.  Delegated Authority.  The Corporation has previously delegated to the Global Compensation,
Benefits and Shared Services Executive of the Corporation authority to approve and adopt proposals
relating to any employee benefit plans sponsored by the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the
 Benefit Plans ), including the power to execute instruments which adopt, amend, modify or
terminate any such plan on behalf of the Corporation or a subsidiary, other than a proposal which
would: (1) provide more favorable treatment to executive officers of the Corporation than other
officers of the Corporation, (2) materially increase the cost to the Corporation, or (3) in the
case of  qualified  pension, profit-sharing or 401(k) plans, or  non-qualified  deferred
compensation or supplemental retirement plans or similar arrangements, materially change the
benefits conferred upon eligible associates.

2.  Wanger Divestiture.  Pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement by and among Bank of America,
N.A., Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and the Corporation, dated September 29, 2009 (the  Agreement ),
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. acquired certain assets and liabilities, including all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of Columbia Wanger Asset Management, L.P. ( Wanger ). The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement occurred on April 30, 2010 (the
 Closing Date ) and constituted a change in the ownership of Wanger as defined in Treasury
Regulation  1.409A-3(i)(5)(v).

3.  Benefits Distribution.  Pursuant to the delegation of authority described in paragraph 1, for
purposes of effectuating benefits distributions with respect to associates employed by Wanger on
the Closing Date ( Wanger Associates ) who are participants in certain Benefit Plans maintained by
the Corporation, including the Bank of America 401(k) Restoration Plan, the Bank of America Pension
Restoration Plan, the Post-2004 Benefit under the Bank of America Retirement Income Assurance Plan
for Legacy Fleet, and the Columbia Management Group Mutual Fund Units Plan, and in order to comply
with applicable tax laws, including Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury
Regulation  1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), the Benefit Plans identified in this paragraph are terminated
with respect to the Wanger Associates, effective as of December 31, 2010, which such date
constitutes the Delink Calculation Date for purposes of the Bank of America Pension Restoration
Plan and the Post-2004 Benefit under the Bank of America Retirement Income Assurance Plan for
Legacy Fleet. Full lump sum distribution of such Wanger Associates  benefits under such Benefit
Plans will occur no later than the date required pursuant to Treasury Regulation
 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). The Benefit Plans identified in this paragraph constitute all agreements,
methods, programs and other arrangements sponsored by the Corporation immediately after the Closing
Date in which the Wanger Associates participate and with respect to which deferrals of compensation
are treated as having been deferred under a single plan under Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(c)(2).

Note : The number of Restricted Stock Units is based on a
 divisor price  of $16.60, which is the five-day average closing
price of Bank of America common stock for the five business days
immediately preceding and including January 15, 2010.

This Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement and all Exhibits hereto (the  Agreement ) is made
between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Bank of America ), and you, an
associate of Bank of America or one of its Subsidiaries.

Bank of America sponsors the Bank of America Corporation 2003 Key Associate Stock Plan (the  Stock
Plan ). A Prospectus describing the Stock Plan has been delivered to you. The Stock Plan itself
is available upon request, and its terms and provisions are incorporated herein by reference. When
used herein, the terms which are defined in the Stock Plan shall have the meanings given to them in
the Stock Plan, as modified herein (if applicable).

The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement are being awarded to you pursuant to your
offer letter with Bank of America dated August 3, 2009 and subject to the following terms and
provisions:

1. 
       
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement, Bank of America
awards to you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown above. Each Restricted Stock Unit
shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Bank of America common
stock. 

2. 
       
     You acknowledge having read the Prospectus and agree to be bound by all the terms and
conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement. 

3. 
       
     If a cash dividend is paid with respect to Bank of America common stock, a cash dividend
equivalent equal to the total cash dividend you would have received had your Restricted Stock
Units been actual shares of Bank of America common stock will be accumulated and paid in cash
through payroll when the Restricted Stock Units become earned and payable. Dividend
equivalents are credited with interest at the three-year constant maturity Treasury rate in
effect on the date of grant until the payment date. 

4. 
       
     The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Award shall become earned by, and payable to, you
in the amounts and on the dates shown on the enclosed Exhibit A. 

5. 
       
     You agree that you shall comply with (or provide adequate assurance as to future compliance
with) all applicable securities laws and income tax laws as determined by Bank of America as a
condition precedent to the delivery of any shares of Bank of America common stock pursuant to
this Agreement. In addition, you agree that, upon request, you will furnish a letter
agreement providing that (i) you will not distribute or resell any of said shares in violation
of the Securities Act of 1933, as

Page 3 of 10

amended, (ii) you will indemnify and hold Bank of America harmless against all liability for any
such violation and (iii) you will accept all liability for any such violation. 

6. 
       
     You agree that the Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement are subject to the
Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy set forth in the Bank of America Corporate Governance
Guidelines. To the extent allowed by and consistent with applicable law and any applicable
limitations period, if it is determined at any time that you have engaged in Detrimental
Conduct or engaged in any hedging or derivative transactions involving Bank of America common
stock that would undermine the long-term performance incentives created by the Restricted
Stock Units, Bank of America will be entitled to recover from you in its sole discretion some
or all of the Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement. You recognize that if you
engage in Detrimental Conduct or any hedging or derivative transactions involving Bank of
America common stock, the losses to Bank of America and/or its Subsidiaries may amount to the
full value of your Restricted Stock Units. 

7. 
       
     By executing and returning a Beneficiary Designation Form, you may designate a beneficiary to
receive payment in connection with the Restricted Stock Units awarded hereunder in the event
of your death while in service with Bank of America or its Subsidiaries. If you do not
designate a beneficiary or if your designated beneficiary does not survive you, then your
beneficiary will be your estate. A Beneficiary Designation Form has been included in your
Award package. 

8. 
       
     The existence of this Award shall not affect in any way the right or power of Bank of America
or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations,
reorganizations or other changes in Bank of America s capital structure or its business, or
any merger or consolidation of Bank of America, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred
or prior preference stocks ahead of or convertible into, or otherwise affecting the Bank of
America common stock or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of Bank of
America, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other
corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. 

9. 
       
     Bank of America may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to this
grant or future Awards that may be granted under the Stock Plan by electronic means or request
your consent to participate in the Stock Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to
receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, agree to participate in the
Stock Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Bank of
America or another third party designated by Bank of America. 

Any notice which either party hereto may be required or permitted to give to the other shall be
in writing and may be delivered personally, by intraoffice mail, by fax, by electronic mail or
other electronic means, or via a postal service, postage prepaid, to such electronic mail or
postal address and directed to such person as Bank of America may notify you from time to time;
and to you at your electronic mail or postal address as shown on the records of Bank of America
from time to time, or at such other electronic mail or postal address as you, by notice to Bank
of America, may designate in writing from time to time. 

10. 
       
     Regardless of any action Bank of America or your employer takes with respect to any or all
income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), you acknowledge
that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your
responsibility and that Bank of America and/or your employer (i) make no representations or
undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of
the grant of Restricted Stock Units, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock
Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units
and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant
or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for
Tax-Related Items. 

2010 US KASP RSU 
(3-year cliff) 
Page 4 of 10

In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must withhold any
Tax-Related Items as a result of your participation in the Stock Plan, you agree as a condition
of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to make arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America
and/or your employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not
limited to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Restricted
Stock Units. In addition, you authorize Bank of America and/or your employer to fulfill its
withholding obligations by all legal means, including, but not limited to: withholding
Tax-Related Items from your wages, salary or other cash compensation your employer pays to you;
withholding Tax-Related Items from the cash proceeds, if any, received upon sale of any Shares
received in payment for your Restricted Stock Units; and at the time of payment, withholding
Shares sufficient to meet minimum withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items. Bank of
America may refuse to issue and deliver Shares in payment of any earned Restricted Stock Units
if you fail to comply with any withholding obligation. 

11. 
       
     The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement are governed by, and subject to, the
laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the United States, as provided in the Stock
Plan. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the
relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby
submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of North Carolina and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted solely in the courts of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina or
the federal courts for the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, where
this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no other courts. 

12. 
       
     In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason,
the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Agreement, and the
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been
included. This Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding the Restricted Stock Units. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations
concerning the Restricted Stock Units are superseded. Subject to the terms of the Stock Plan,
this Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument signed by both parties. 

13. 
       
     If you move to any country outside of the United States during the term of your Award,
additional terms and conditions may apply to your Award. Bank of America reserves the right
to impose other requirements on the Award to the extent Bank of America determines it is
necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of
the Award and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Bank of America has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized

This Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement and all Exhibits hereto (the  Agreement ) is made

is available upon request, and its terms and provisions are incorporated herein by reference. When
used herein, the terms which are defined in the Stock Plan shall have the meanings given to them in
the Stock Plan, as modified herein (if applicable).

The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement are being awarded to you in connection with
your participation in the Performance Year 2009 program, subject to the following terms and
provisions:

1. 
       
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement, Bank of America
awards to you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown above. Each Restricted Stock Unit
shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Bank of America common
stock. 

2. 
       
     You acknowledge having read the Prospectus and agree to be bound by all the terms and
conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement. 

3. 
       
     The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Award shall become earned by, and payable to, you
in the amounts and on the dates shown on the enclosed Exhibit A. 

4. 
       
     If a cash dividend is paid with respect to Bank of America common stock, a cash dividend
equivalent equal to the total cash dividend you would have received had your Restricted Stock
Units been actual shares of Bank of America common stock will be accumulated and paid in cash
through payroll when the Restricted Stock Units become earned and payable. Dividend
equivalents are credited with interest at the three-year constant maturity Treasury rate in
effect on the date of grant until the payment date. 

5.

     You agree that the Award covered by this Agreement is subject to the Incentive Compensation
Recoupment Policy set forth in the Bank of America Corporate Governance Guidelines. To the
extent allowed by and consistent with applicable law and any applicable limitations period, if
it is determined at any time that you have engaged in Detrimental Conduct or engaged in any
hedging or derivative transactions involving Bank of America common stock in violation of the
Bank of America Corporation Code of Ethics that would undermine the long-term performance
incentives created by the Award, Bank of America will be entitled to recover from you in its
sole discretion some or all of the Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement. You
recognize that if you engage in Detrimental Conduct or any hedging or derivative transactions
involving Bank of America common stock, the losses to Bank of America and/or its Subsidiaries

7. 
       
     You may designate a beneficiary to receive payment in connection with the Restricted Stock
Units awarded hereunder in the event of your death while in service with Bank of America or

beneficiary does not survive you, then your beneficiary will be your estate. 

8. 
       
     The existence of this Award shall not affect in any way the right or power of Bank of America
or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations,
reorganizations or other changes in Bank of America s capital structure or its business, or

or prior preference stocks ahead of or convertible into, or otherwise affecting the Bank of
America common stock or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of Bank of
America, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other

other electronic means, or via a postal service, postage prepaid, to such electronic mail or
postal address and directed to such person as Bank of America may notify you from time to time;
and to you at your electronic mail or postal address as shown on the records of Bank of America
from time to time, or at such other electronic mail or postal address as you, by notice to Bank
of America, may designate in writing from time to time. 

10. 
       
     Regardless of any action Bank of America or your employer takes with respect to any or all
income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), you acknowledge
that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your
responsibility and that Bank of America and/or your employer (i) make no representations or
undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of

Units the subsequent sale of Shares acquired upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units
and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant
or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for

Tax-Related Items as a result of your participation in the Stock Plan, you agree as a condition
of the grant of the

America may refuse to issue and deliver Shares in payment of any earned Restricted Stock Units
if you fail to comply with any withholding obligation. 

11. 
       
     The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement are governed by, and subject to, the
laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the United States, as provided in the Stock
Plan. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the

the federal courts for the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, where
this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no other courts. 

12. 
       
     In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason,
the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Agreement, and the
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been
included. This Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding the Restricted Stock Units. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations
concerning the Restricted Stock Units are superseded. Subject to the terms of the Stock Plan,
this Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument signed by both parties.

(iii)

which you actively solicited or with whom you worked or otherwise had
material contact in the course of your employment with Bank of America

equivalents) remain payable, you will not engage in Detrimental
Conduct. 

(iii)

11. 
       
     Regardless of any action Bank of America or your employer takes with respect to any or all
income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), you acknowledge
that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your
responsibility and that Bank of America and/or your employer (i) make no representations or

Shares of Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items. 

In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must withhold any

condition of the grant of the Shares of Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement to make

Plan. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the
relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby
submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of North Carolina and agree that such

the federal courts for the United States for the Western District of North Carolina, where
this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no other courts. 

13. 
       
     In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason,
the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Agreement, and the
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been
included. This Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding the Shares of Restricted Stock. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations
concerning the Restricted Stock Shares are superseded. Subject to the terms of the Stock
Plan, this Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument signed by both parties.

This Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement and all

terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement.

3. The Restricted Stock Units covered by this Award shall become earned by,

4. If a cash dividend is paid with respect to Bank of America common stock, a

received had your Restricted Stock Units been actual shares of Bank of America
common stock will be accumulated and paid in cash through payroll when the
Restricted Stock Units become earned and payable. Dividend equivalents are
credited with interest at the three-year constant maturity Treasury rate in
effect on the date of grant until the payment date.

5. To the extent this Award is paid in shares of Bank of America common stock,

entitled to recover from you in its sole discretion some or all of the cash or

such requirements, all to the extent determined by Bank of America in its
discretion to be applicable to you.

America s beneficiary designation procedures, as in effect from time to time.

the other shall be in writing and may be delivered personally, by intraoffice
mail, by fax, by electronic mail or other electronic means, or via a postal
service, postage prepaid, to such electronic mail or postal address and

and to you at your electronic mail or postal address as shown on the records of
Bank of America from time to time, or at such other electronic mail or postal
address as you, by notice to Bank of America, may designate in writing from
time to time.

10. Regardless of any action Bank of America or your employer takes with
respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding
( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all
Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by Bank of America or your employer. You further
acknowledge that Bank of America and/or your employer (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related
Items in connection with any aspect of the grant of Restricted Stock Units,
including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent
sale of Shares acquired upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units and the
receipt of any dividends and/or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to
structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to
reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items. Further, if you have
become subject to the Tax-Related Items in connection with the Award in more
than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Bank of America or your employer
(or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for
Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must
withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of your participation in the Stock
Plan, you agree as a condition of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to
make arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America and/or your employer to
enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited
to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the
Restricted Stock Units. In addition, you authorize Bank of America and/or your
employer to fulfill its

withholding obligations by all legal means, including,
but not limited to, withholding Tax-Related Items from your wages, salary or
other cash compensation your employer pays to you, withholding Tax-Related
Items from the cash proceeds, if any, received upon any sale of any Shares
received in payment for your Restricted Stock Units and, at the time of
payment, withholding Shares sufficient to meet minimum withholding obligations
for Tax-Related Items. Bank of America may refuse to pay any earned Restricted
Stock Units if you fail to comply with any withholding obligation.

11. The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement are governed by,
and subject to, the laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the United
States, as provided in the Stock Plan. For purposes of litigating any dispute
that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties
evidenced by this grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of North Carolina and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted solely in the courts of Mecklenburg County, North
Carolina or the federal courts for the United States for the Western District
of North Carolina, where this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no
other courts.

12. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. This
Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding the Restricted Stock Units. Any prior agreements, commitments or
negotiations concerning the Restricted Stock Units are superseded. Subject to
the terms of the Stock Plan, this Agreement may only be amended by a written
instrument signed by both parties.

13. If you move to any country outside of the United States during the term of
your Award, additional terms and conditions may apply to your Award. Bank of
America reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Award to the
extent Bank of America determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Award and to
require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

you do not engage in Competition during such period, (ii) you
comply with the covenants described in paragraph (d) below and
(iii) prior to each applicable Settlement Date, you provide Bank
of America with a written certification that you have not engaged
in Competition to the extent the Competition restriction in (i)

In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must
withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of your participation in the Stock
Plan, you agree as a condition of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to
make arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America

and/or your employer to
enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited
to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the
Restricted Stock Units. In addition, you authorize Bank of America and/or your
employer to fulfill its withholding obligations by all legal means, including,
but not limited to, withholding Tax-Related Items from your wages, salary or
other cash compensation your employer pays to you, withholding Tax-Related
Items from the cash proceeds, if any, received upon any sale of any Shares
received in payment for your Restricted Stock Units and, at the time of
payment, withholding Shares sufficient to meet minimum withholding obligations
for Tax-Related Items. Bank of America may refuse to issue and deliver Shares
in payment of any earned Restricted Stock Units if you fail to comply with any
withholding obligation.

11. The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement are governed by,
and subject to, the laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the United
States, as provided in the Stock Plan. For purposes of litigating any dispute
that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties
evidenced by this grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of North Carolina and agree that such
litigation shall be conducted solely in the courts of Mecklenburg County, North
Carolina or the federal courts for the United States for the Western District
of North Carolina, where this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no
other courts.

12. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. This
Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding the Restricted Stock Units. Any prior agreements, commitments or
negotiations concerning the Restricted Stock Units are superseded. Subject to
the terms of the Stock Plan, this Agreement may only be amended by a written
instrument signed by both parties.

your Award, additional terms and conditions may apply to your Award. Bank of
America reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Award to the
extent Bank of America determines it is necessary or advisable in order to
comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Award and to
require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Re:       Retention Award   Letter Agreement  

Dear Bruce:

You have been identified as a key contributor who is critical to successfully accomplishing the
merger between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch   Co. Inc (the  Company ). Your leadership and
commitment are vital now and in the coming months. Accordingly, the Company wishes to offer you a
Retention Award as described in this Letter Agreement.

I.        Eligibility and Payment   
You are eligible to receive a Retention Award in the total amount of  $3,000,000 , earned in two
equal installments on the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Date of the merger
between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America (the  Retention Period. ) You will be eligible for
payment of the Retention Award installments if you satisfy the following terms:

You are actively employed by the Company on the first and second anniversaries of the
Effective Date of the merger between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America; and 

You continue to perform your work in a satisfactory and positive manner, as determined
by the Company in its sole discretion. 

If earned, each of the two installments of the Retention Award will be paid, less applicable
deductions and withholdings, within 60 days of the applicable anniversary date.

You will continue to be eligible for the Retention Award if the Company eliminates your position
during the Retention Period and you meet all of the eligibility requirements to receive severance
pay under the severance plan applicable to you, including signing and not revoking a separation
agreement and release, or if your employment terminates due to your death or disability. In these
circumstances, the next scheduled annual installment of your Retention Award would be paid to you
or your estate no later than sixty (60) days following the termination of your employment .  You
would not be eligible for additional annual installments, if any, beyond the one accelerated annual
payment. You will  not  be eligible for the Retention Award and it will be cancelled if (i)
you voluntarily terminate your employment or transfer to another position during the Retention
Period or (ii) if you engage in conduct that results in the immediate termination of your
employment, as determined by the Company consistent with applicable Company policies and practices.

This is an individual arrangement and your eligibility is further contingent upon you maintaining
the confidentiality of the Retention Award and Letter Agreement. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, you are not permitted to discuss the Retention Award or Letter Agreement with any
other person at the Company except your division head, Human Resources executive, or their
designated representatives. You also are not permitted to discuss the Retention Award or Letter
Agreement with any other person except your financial advisors and spouse, partner or other close
family members, and then only on condition that you advise them of the obligation to maintain
confidentiality. Your obligation to maintain the confidentiality of this Retention Award is
enforceable regardless of whether you remain employed and regardless of whether you are paid the
Retention Award.

II.       Other Terms/Release of Claims  

The Retention Award is not considered eligible earnings for purposes of qualified and non-qualified
Company plans in which you participate.

If you take an approved leave of absence during the effective period of this Agreement, the
Retention Award may be prorated to exclude the period of leave.

1 

This Letter Agreement does not create a contract of employment and does not provide any rights
regarding your continued employment with the Company. Retention Award payment will not reduce any
severance benefits for which you may be eligible in the event your employment is terminated without
cause. The terms of the applicable plans will apply.

We ask that you consider the terms of this Retention Award and, if you agree, sign and return the
duplicate copy of this letter to me no later than  2/11/09 .

Sincerely,

/s/ Michael Lloyd

VP, Human Resources

This 2011 Stock Units Award Agreement and all Exhibits hereto (the  Agreement )

shall have the meanings given to such terms on the enclosed Exhibit A.

event of your death while in service with Bank of America or its Subsidiaries
in accordance with Bank of America s beneficiary designation procedures, as in
effect from time to time. If you do not designate a beneficiary or if your

estate.

6. Bank of America may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any
documents related to this Award by electronic means or request your consent to
participate in the Award by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive
such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, agree to participate

of the Bank of America Corporation Code of Ethics that would undermine the
performance incentives created by the Award, Bank of America will be entitled
to recover from you in its sole discretion some or all of the cash paid to you

( Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all
Tax-Related Items owed by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by Bank of America or your employer. You further

representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related
Items in connection with any aspect of the grant of Stock Units, including the
grant and vesting of the Stock Units

or payout of the Award; and (ii) do not
commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock Units to
reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items. Further, if you have

than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Bank of America or your employer
(or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for
Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

In the event Bank of America determines that it and/or your employer must
withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of your Award, you agree as a
condition of the grant of the Stock Units to make arrangements satisfactory to
Bank of America and/or your employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding
requirements, including, but not limited to, withholding any applicable
Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Stock Units. In addition, you
authorize Bank of America and/or your employer to fulfill its withholding
obligations by all legal means, including, but not limited to, withholding
Tax-Related Items from your wages, salary or other cash compensation your
employer pays to you. Bank of America may refuse to pay any earned Stock Units
if you fail to comply with any withholding obligation.

States. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or
indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this Award or this
Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive

federal courts for the United States for the Western District of North
Carolina, where this grant is made and/or to be performed, and no other courts.

10. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
remaining parts of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. This
Agreement constitutes the final understanding between you and Bank of America
regarding this Award. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations
concerning this Award are superseded. This Agreement may only be amended by a
written instrument signed by both parties.

additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.

right of Bank of America to terminate your employment at any time, nor confer
upon you any right to continue in the employment of Bank of America or its
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, a transfer of your employment
between Bank of America and a Subsidiary of Bank of America,

or terminate this Agreement in whole or in part. No termination, amendment or
modification of this Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way your
rights with respect to the Award, without your written consent.

15. Your rights and interests under this Agreement may not be assigned or
transferred. To the extent that you acquire a right to receive payments from
Bank of America under this Agreement, such right shall be no greater than the
right of any unsecured general creditor of Bank of America. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or any
fiduciary relationship between you and Bank of America. This Agreement shall
be binding on Bank of America and any successor in interest of Bank of America.

16. The Award shall be equitably adjusted as determined by Bank of America in
the event of any stock dividend, stock split or similar change in the

also included if you wish to designate a beneficiary or if you wish to change your current
beneficiary designation.

What you need to do 

1. 
       
     Review the Award Agreement to ensure you understand its provisions. With each award you
receive, provisions of your Award Agreement may change so it is important to review your Award
Agreement. 

2. 
       
     Print the Award Agreement and file it with your important papers. 

3. 
       
     Accept your Award Agreement through the online acceptance process.* 

4. 
       
     Designate a beneficiary for your award by completing a Beneficiary Designation Form and
returning it to the address listed on the form. 

* 
       
     If you do not accept your Award Agreement through the online acceptance process by November 15,
2009, or such other date that may be communicated, Bank of America will automatically accept the
Award Agreement on your behalf. 

Summary of Rule of 60 vesting condition 

Below is a summary of the vesting condition for Rule of 60 that applies to eligible associates
for awards granted in 2006 or later. You meet the Rule of 60 if your age plus years of vesting
service equals 60, with a minimum of 10 years of vesting service and no minimum age. If you do not
meet the Rule of 60, this vesting condition does not apply to you.

If your employment ends after you have attained the Rule of 60 , to the extent the award
does not otherwise vest upon termination, the award will vest in accordance with the original
vesting schedule so long as you comply with the Rule of 60 vesting condition, as follows:

You must not work for a named competitor  of Bank of America during the remaining
vesting period of your award. On the next page is the current list of named competitors. This
list will be updated annually. The list in effect at your termination of employment will
control. 

You must annually provide a written certification  that you are not working for any
of the named competitors. Each December, Bank of America will send to the most recent mailing
address you have on record a certification form for you to complete and return. If you do not
receive your form by early in the new year, you are responsible for obtaining a certification
form by contacting the Bank of America Personnel Center at 1.800.556.6044. You will be
considered in breach of the vesting condition if you fail to provide written certification as
and when required. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the company receives your
annual certification. Accordingly, you need to keep the company apprised of any changes to
your mailing address. 

If you comply with these requirements, your award will continue to vest in accordance with the
original vesting schedule. However, if you fail to meet either of the above requirements, the
unvested portion of your award will be immediately canceled.
