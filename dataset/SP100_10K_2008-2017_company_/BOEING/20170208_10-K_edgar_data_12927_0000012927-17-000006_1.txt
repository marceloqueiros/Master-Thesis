The major programs for strategic defense and intelligence systems include:   Ground-based Midcourse Defense   (  GMD  ); satellite systems: commercial, civil and military satellites; and space exploration:   Space Launch System   (  SLS  ), Commercial Crew and International Space Station (ISS). This segment also includes our joint venture operations related to   United Launch Alliance  .  
  Global Services   Support   Segment 
  This segment provides customers with mission readiness through total support solutions. Our global services business sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance, modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training. Major programs supported by integrated logistics include the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook for domestic and international customers. Aircraft modernization and sustainment includes major support performed as part of the C-17 Globemaster III Integrated Sustainment Program and aircraft programs for the   Airborne Early Warning and Control   (  AEW C  ) and   Airborne Warning and Control Systems   (  AWACS  ).  
   
  Boeing Capital   Segment 
  BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure.   BCC   s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.  
   
  Financial and Other Business Information 
  See the Summary of Business Segment Data and Note   21   to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments. 
   
  Intellectual Property 
  We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
   
  Non-U.S. Revenues 
  See Note   21   to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding non-U.S. revenues.

Research and Development 
  Research and development (R D) expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. R D expenditures are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. government contracts. 
  Our total research and development expense, net amounted to   $4.6 billion  ,   $3.3 billion   and   $3.0 billion   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. 
  Research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. Bid and proposal costs were   $311 million  ,   $286 million   and   $289 million   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. 
   
  Employees 
  Total workforce level at   December 31, 2016   was approximately   150,500  . As of   December 31, 2016  , our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions:

Competition 
  The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. 
  BDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into   2017  .

Regulatory Matters 
  Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. 
  Government Contracts.   The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. 
  Commercial Aircraft.   In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. 
  Environmental.   We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. 
  A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note   11   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  International.   Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. 
   
  Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies 
  We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are  

4 

     Table of Contents  

aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies. 
   
  Suppliers 
  We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. 
   
  Seasonality 
  No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC, press and earnings releases and other written and oral communications, contain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as  may,   should,   expects,   intends,   projects,   plans,   believes,   estimates,   targets,   anticipates  and similar expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. 
  Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors, including  

5 

     Table of Contents  

those set forth in the  Risk Factors  section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report. 
  Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks. 
  Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft.   The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the continued operations of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. 
  We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate.   Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business. 
  We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines.   We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.

     Table of Contents  

Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. 
  The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. 
  We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability.   We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed, if other production rate changes result in significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer. 
  Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.   Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program. 
  If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues.   Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues. 
  Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. 
  We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the   U.S. DoD  . Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills.  
   In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012  

7 

     Table of Contents  

and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure. 
  In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the   U.S. DoD   and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations committees included funding for Boeing s major programs in FY2017, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache,   KC-46A Tanker   and P-8 programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2017 and beyond will affect Boeing s programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.  
  In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the   U.S. DoD   to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the   U.S. DoD   customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted. 
  We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks. 
  In   2016  ,     23%   of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. 
  Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.   New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS business. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. 
  The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts.   The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as  continuing resolutions  rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. 
  We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts.   U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a  

8 

     Table of Contents  

specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false. 
  We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. 
  Our BDS business generated approximately   71%   of its   2016   revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of   $1,128 million   on the   USAF KC-46A Tanker   contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. 
  Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15,   USAF KC-46A Tanker  , and commercial and military satellites. 
  We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks. 
  Our BDS business generated approximately   29%   of its   2016   revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include   GMD  , Proprietary and   SLS   programs. 
  We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks. 
  Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges.

Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. 
  We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations.  
  We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. 
  Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers  assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. 
  With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units  expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance. 
  Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under  Management s Discussion and Analysis

  Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales. 
  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our   U.S. DoD   and international customers will intensify competition for many of our products and services. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share. 
  We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. 
  In   2016  , non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately   59%   of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including: 
             
    changes in regulatory requirements; 
                
    domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements; 
                
    fluctuations in international currency exchange rates; 
                
    volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders; 
                
    the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants; 
                
    the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States; 
                
    uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees; 
                
    imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; 
                
    the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries; 
                
    compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and 
                
    unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts. 
     While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.

The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
  We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks. 
  A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected. 
  We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. 
  We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , our airplane financing commitments totaled   $14,847 million   and   $16,283 million  . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments. 
  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures. 
  As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We  

12 

     Table of Contents  

also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. 
  Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures. 
  We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities. 
  Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses. 
  Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services. 
  Some of our and our suppliers  workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages. 
  Approximately   57,000   employees, which constitute   38%   of our total workforce, were union represented as of   December 31, 2016  . We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BMA program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with   11   U.S. labor organizations and   7   non-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions  requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations. 
  We have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders  '   equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods. 
  The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the   Employee Retirement Income Security Act   and discretionary contributions to improve the plans  '   funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions     could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our  

13 

     Table of Contents  

annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders  '   equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see      Management  '  s Discussion and Analysis  -  Critical Accounting Policies  -  Pension Plans      on pages   46       47   of this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans. 
    
  Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. 
  We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note   11   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Unauthorized access to our or our customers  information and systems could negatively impact our business. 
  We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers  confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

  Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
  Overview 
  We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. 
  Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses   Commercial Airplanes and   Defense, Space   Security   (  BDS  )   supplemented and supported by   Boeing Capital   (  BCC  ). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset.   BCC   facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers. 
  In November 2016, we announced plans for the formation of Boeing Global Services (BGS), which will bring together certain Commercial Aviation Services businesses currently included in the Commercial Airplanes segment and certain BDS businesses (primarily those currently included in the Global Services   Support (GS S) segment). We expect BGS to be operational during the second half of 2017.

    These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page   42   -   43   for important information about these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
     Revenues     
  The following table summarizes Revenues: 

Revenues in   2016     decreased   by   $1,543 million   or   2%   compared with   2015  . Commercial Airplanes revenues   decreased   by   $979 million   or   1%   primarily due to lower deliveries. BDS revenues for   2016     decreased   by   $890 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower revenues in   Boeing Military Aircraft   (  BMA  ) and   Network   Space Systems   (  N SS  ), partially offset by higher revenues in   GS S  .  
  Revenues in 2015 increased by $5,352 million or 6% compared with 2014. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix. BDS revenues decreased by $493 million or 2% primarily due to lower revenues in the   GS S   and   N SS   segments. 
  The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries.

Earnings From Operations     
  The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: 

Earnings from operations in   2016     decreased   by   $1,609 million   compared with   2015   due to lower earnings at Commercial Airplanes, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). Commercial Airplanes earnings in   2016   decreased by   $2,027 million   primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in second quarter as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses.  
  Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $30 million compared with 2014 primarily reflecting a fourth quarter charge of $885 million related to the 747 program at Commercial Airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker recorded by Commercial Airplanes and our BMA segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments.  
  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2016, we recorded charges of   $1,128 million  , of which   $772 million   was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and   $356 million   at our   BMA   segment. During 2015, we recorded charges of   $835 million  :   $513 million   at Commercial Airplanes and   $322 million   at our BMA segment. During 2014, we recorded charges of   $425 million  :   $238 million   at Commercial Airplanes and   $187 million   at our BMA segment. During 2016 and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million. 
  Core operating earnings for   2016     decreased   by   $2,277 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs described above.  
  Core operating earnings in 2015 decreased by $1,119 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges.

     Table of Contents  

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other   The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: 

* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See pages   42   -   43  . 
  Deferred compensation expense   decreased   by   $17 million   in   2016   and increased by $19 million in 2015, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price. 
  Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by   $  20 million   in   2016   and decreased by   $  64 million in 2015 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations.  
  Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled   $523 million  ,   $2,786 million   and   $2,208 million   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: 

The decrease in net periodic pension benefit cost of   $2,263 million   in   2016   is primarily due to lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. The lower service costs reflect the changes to our retirement plans whereby certain employees transitioned in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. The lower amortization of actuarial losses reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%.  
  The increase in 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to $557 million of higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2015 resulting from the 2014 year-end discount rate decrease from 4.8% to 3.9%. 
  A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note   21  .

     Table of Contents  

Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows: 

The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in   2016   was a benefit of   $217 million   compared with expense of   $421 million   in   2015  . The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. Unallocated pension expense recognized in earnings decreased by $1,048 million in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years and lower curtailment charges in 2015. 
  Other Earnings Items 

Interest and debt expense increased by   $31 million   in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances. 
  Our effective income tax rates were   12.1%  ,   27.7%   and   23.7%   for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than 2015 primarily due to tax benefits of   $617 million   recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2011 - 2012 federal tax audits. Our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of   $524 million   recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007-2010 federal tax audits. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note   4   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Total Costs and Expenses ( Cost of Sales ) 
  Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and   BDS   predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.  

22 

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes cost of sales: 

Cost of sales in   2016     decreased   by   $1,298 million  , or 2%, compared with   2015  , primarily due to lower volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at Commercial Airplanes.  
  Cost of sales in 2015 increased by $5,336 million, or 7%, compared with 2014, primarily driven by the $5,352 million, or 6%, increase in revenues. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,846 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 10% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $252 million, or 1%, primarily due to the 2% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges.  
  Research and Development   The following table summarizes our Research and development expense: 

Research and development expense in   2016     increased   by   $1,296 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on 777X at Commercial Airplanes. Research and development expense in 2015 increased by $284 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher 777X spending at Commercial Airplanes which more than offset lower spending at BDS.  
  Backlog 
  Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: 

23 

     Table of Contents  

Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during   2016   and   2015   was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders.  
  Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in   2016   was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS contracts. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2015 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards.  
   
  Additional Considerations 
   
  KC-46A Tanker   In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the   U.S. Air Force   (  USAF  ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The   KC-46A Tanker   is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the   USAF   authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. 
  Through 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,260 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2016 we recorded reach-forward losses of   $1,128 million  . In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded charges of $243 million which were primarily driven by higher than anticipated certification and test rework and the change incorporation impact to EMD and LRIP aircraft. In the second quarter of 2016, technical complexities and schedule delays resulted in charges of $573 million. The charges were driven by costs associated with certification delays and higher costs associated with the overall revised schedule, as well as a boom axial load issue that required a hardware solution, and production concurrency between late-stage development testing and the initial production aircraft. Charges of $312 million in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by greater than anticipated effort required to incorporate previously identified changes into LRIP aircraft currently in production, along with associated manufacturing and schedule disruptions. The need for this additional work was identified as aircraft were being prepared for certification and testing. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs.  
  The first tanker delivery is expected to occur in late 2017 with 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in early 2018. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion.   
   
  Russia/Ukraine   We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 
   
  Export-Import Bank of the United States   Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than  

24 

     Table of Contents  

$10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources.  
   
  Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
  Commercial Airplanes 
  Business Environment and Trends 
  Airline Industry Environment   Passenger traffic growth is estimated at approximately 6% in 2016. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. Air cargo traffic growth is estimated at approximately 3% in 2016. The sluggish air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions. 
  Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2016 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to be approximately $36 billion in 2016. 2017 airline profits are expected to be slightly lower than 2016, at approximately $30 billion. 
  The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.8% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term projections of 2.9% average annual GDP growth, we project a $5.9 trillion market for approximately 39,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. However, we continue to monitor near-term market conditions in the wide-body segment. 
  The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations. 
  Industry Competitiveness   The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 
  Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes  contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers.  
  We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Some of these competitors  

25 

     Table of Contents  

have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including  launch aid,  which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. 
  Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors  revenues and profits. Many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong U.S. dollar experienced in 2016 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings. 
  We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.  
   
  Results of Operations     

Revenues     
  Commercial Airplanes revenues   decreased   by   $979 million   or   1%   in   2016   compared with   2015   primarily due to lower deliveries. Revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix.

  Earnings From Operations     
  Earnings from operations in   2016     decreased   by   $2,027 million   compared with the same period in   2015  . The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of   $1,415 million  , delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of   $1,258 million   compared with   $885 million   in   2015  . Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Earnings include reach-forward losses related to the KC-46A Tanker of   $772 million   recorded in 2016 compared with   $513 million   in 2015.  
  Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix. 
  Backlog    
  Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. 
  The decrease in backlog during   2016   and 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders.  
  Accounting Quantity   The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity  

27 

     Table of Contents  

is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life. Estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. 
  The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. 
  The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 

* At   December 31, 2016  , the 747 accounting quantity has   26   undelivered aircraft, including   9   that have not been sold or may be remarketed.  
  ** The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.  
   
  Program Highlights 
  737 Program   The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2016 due to the program     s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan to increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 
   
  747 Program   During the fourth quarter of 2016 we received an order for 14 new aircraft. We are currently producing at rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of 1.0 aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from 1,574 to 1,555 aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted  

28 

     Table of Contents  

in a reach-forward loss of   $1,188 million   in the second quarter of 2016. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of   $885 million   in 2015 and   $70 million   during the first quarter of 2016 related to our prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and anticipating lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 
   
  767 Program   The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2016 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We increased the combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1.5 per month to 2 per month in April 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017.  
   
  777 Program   We produced at a rate of 8.3 per month during 2016. We implemented a planned production rate decrease to 7 per month at the beginning of 2017. In addition, we announced in December 2016 that, due to lower than anticipated 777 orders, we plan to further reduce the rate to 5 per month in the second half of 2017. We reduced the program accounting quantity from 1,650 to 1,625 aircraft, reflecting recent order activity and planned production rates.  
  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.  
   
  787 Program   During 2016, the program received 58 net new orders and increased the production rate from 10 per month to a rate of 12 per month. We are planning a further rate increase to 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged.  
  We remain focused on improving productivity and obtaining additional orders to support planned production. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft.  
  During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with those airplanes were included in research and development expense. We produced the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft in 2009 but have been unable to sell them at acceptable prices. The aircraft have been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early 2017 for commercial sale based on sales activity and market interest. However, during the second quarter of 2016 we determined that firm orders for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely, and that the Company would not invest company funds for their refurbishment. The Company also determined the costs to refurbish the aircraft at a future date would be prohibitively expensive. We therefore determined that the aircraft were not commercially saleable, and accordingly, costs of   $1,235 million   associated with these aircraft were reclassified from 787 program inventory to research and development expense during the second quarter of 2016. We have firm orders for the five remaining undelivered early build aircraft and plan to complete retrofitting them by the end of 2017  . 
  The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. We are continuing to monitor wide-body demand and if sufficient orders do not materialize during the next several quarters we  

29 

     Table of Contents  

may consider appropriate adjustments to the planned production rate increase. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with the planned production rate and productivity improvements, supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. 
   
  Fleet Support   We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately   1.5%   of total consolidated costs of products and services. 
   
  Program Development   The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.

  We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013. 

Additional Considerations 
  The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

  Business Environment and Trends  
  United States Government Defense Environment Overview     The new U.S. administration and key members of the 115th Congress have expressed a general desire to reverse the effects of the budgetary reductions of the past several years. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act), which mandated limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, remains in effect through the 2021 government fiscal year causing budget uncertainty and continued risk of future sequestration cuts.  
  In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. 
    
  Funding timeliness also remains a risk as the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on April 28, 2017. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.    
    
  International Environment Overview   The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of international opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats.   
   
  Results of Operations     

Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: 

Revenues     
  BDS   revenues in   2016     decreased   by   $890 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower revenues of   $909 million   and   $705 million   in the   BMA   and   N SS   segments, partially offset by higher revenues of   $724 million   in the   GS S   segment. 
  BDS   revenues in 2015 decreased by $493 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenues in the   GS S   and   N SS   segments. 
  Earnings From Operations     
  BDS   earnings from operations in   2016     decreased   by   $266 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower earnings of   $233 million   and   $80 million   in the   N SS   and BMA segments, partially offset by higher earnings of   $47 million   in the   GS S   segment. Included above are net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were   $429 million   higher in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily reflecting the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and the charge of $162 million on the Commercial Crew program recorded at N SS during 2016.  
  BDS   earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due to higher earnings in all three segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49 million lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily reflecting higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at   BMA   which more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the   GS S   segment. 
  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BDS earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. 
  Backlog 
  Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated.   BDS   total backlog was   $57,134 million   at   December 31, 2016  , reflecting a   decrease   of   1%   from   December 31, 2015  . BDS total backlog was $57,675 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2014. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below.

Additional Considerations 
  Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include   Ground-based Midcourse Defense   (  GMD  ), Proprietary and Space Launch System (  SLS  ) programs. 
  Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.

Revenues     
  BMA   revenues in   2016     decreased   by   $909 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to lower revenues of $973 million related to fewer C-17 deliveries and timing and mix of deliveries on the CH-47 Chinook and F/A-18 programs. 
  BMA   revenues in 2015 increased by $14 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher revenues of $1,131 million from a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 on the F-15 program due to completion of contract negotiations, higher milestone revenue on the USAF KC-46A Tanker program, and higher deliveries and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. The increase was partially offset by fewer deliveries and mix on the F/A-18, Apache and V-22 programs.  
  Earnings From Operations     
  BMA   earnings from operations in   2016     decreased   by   $80 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook, and C-17, partially offset by higher volume and mix on the Apache and P-8 programs. BMA recorded charges of   $356 million   in 2016 compared with   $322 million   in 2015 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were   $253 million   higher in   2016   than in   2015   primarily driven by the absence of favorable

F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and higher USAF KC-46A Tanker charges recorded in 2016. 
  BMA   earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to C-17 charges in 2014, higher CH-47 Chinook deliveries in 2015 and higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs.   BMA   recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. In addition,   BMA   recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partially offset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments. 
  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BMA earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. 
  Backlog 
  BMA   total backlog of   $25,441 million   at   December 31, 2016     decrease  d by   6%   from   December 31, 2015  , reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the P-8, Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and weapons programs. 
  BMA   total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $27,088 million, a decrease of 7% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F-15, Apache, C-17 and F/A-18 programs.

Revenues     
  N SS   revenues in   2016     decreased   by   $705 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to lower revenue of $838 million related to the Commercial Crew program, lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs, and lower volume on proprietary programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the SLS program.

     Table of Contents  

N SS   revenues in 2015 decreased by $252 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenue of $1,061 million, primarily on satellite and proprietary programs and volume and mix of sales to our United Launch Alliance (  ULA  ) joint venture, partially offset by higher volume on the Commercial Crew program. 
  New-build satellite deliveries were as follows: 

Earnings From Operations     
  N SS   earnings from operations in   2016     decreased   by   $233 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to a charge of $162 million during the third quarter of 2016 and lower volume on the Commercial Crew program. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were   $186 million   higher in   2016   than   2015   primarily reflecting the charge on the Commercial Crew program during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings. 
  N SS   earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $28 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher earnings of $83 million from improved performance on several   Electronic and Information Solutions   (  E IS  ) programs partially offset by lower performance on a development program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $10 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on commercial satellite programs. 
  N SS   earnings from operations include equity earnings of   $255 million  ,   $183 million   and   $211 million   primarily from our   ULA   joint venture in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively.

  N SS   total backlog of   $13,347 million   at   December 31, 2016     increase  d by   8%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due to adjustments recorded in 2016 related to backlog in prior years. Current year contract awards for missile defense, SLS, and government satellite programs were more than offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. 
  N SS   total backlog was $12,347 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 17% from December 31, 2014 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards including orders from NASA for International Space Station engineering support and Post Certification Mission 1 on the Commercial Crew program.

Revenues     
  GS S   revenues in   2016     increased   by   $724 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher volume in several   Aircraft Modernization   Sustainment   (  AM S  ), Training Systems   Government Services (TSGS), and Integrated Logistics (IL) programs.  
  GS S   revenues in 2015 decreased by $255 million compared with 2014 primarily due to final   Airborne Early Warning and Control   (  AEW C  ) deliveries and lower volume in several TSGS programs, partially offset by higher volume on several   IL   programs. 
  Earnings From Operations     
  GS S   earnings from operations in   2016     increased   by   $47 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher volume and mix across the segment partially offset by lower performance. The impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2016.  
  GS S   earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $96 million compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance across the segment. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $57 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to favorable F-15 program adjustments.

Boeing Capital 
  Business Environment and Trends 
  BCC s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at   December 31, 2016   totaled   $4,115 million  . A substantial portion of BCC s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft. 
  BCC provided customer financing of   $1,376 million   and   $586 million   during   2016   and   2015  . While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2017 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC s new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions.  
  Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately   2,200   western-built commercial jet aircraft (  8.8%   of current world fleet) were parked at the end of   2016  , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately   7%   are not expected to return to service. At the end of   2015   and   2014  ,   9.5%   and   9.8%   of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

Revenues     
  BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income.   BCC   s revenues in   2016   decreased by   $115 million   compared with   2015   primarily due to lower lease income, and lower end of lease settlement payments.   BCC   s revenues in 2015 were consistent with 2014.  
  Earnings From Operations     
  BCC s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in   2016   increased by   $9 million   primarily due to lower asset impairment expense which more than offset lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $42 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher asset impairment expense.

  The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:   

BCC   s customer financing and investment portfolio at   December 31, 2016     increased   from   December 31, 2015  ,   primarily due to new volume of $1,376 million partially offset by note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off.  
  At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , BCC had   $6 million   and   $49 million   of assets that were held for sale or re-lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately   $46 million   are scheduled to be returned off lease during   2017  . We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended. 
  BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flow Summary 

Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was   $10.5 billion   during   2016  , compared with   $9.4 billion   during   2015   and   $8.9 billion   in   2014  . The   increase   of   $1.1 billion   in   2016   was primarily  

38 

     Table of Contents  

due to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. Advances and progress billings   decreased   by   $1.9 billion   in   2016   and increased by   $0.4 billion   in   2015   and   $6.9 billion   in   2014  . Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were   $0.1 billion   in   2016   and insignificant in   2015   compared with   $0.8 billion   in   2014  .  
  Investing Activities   Cash used by investing activities during   2016   and   2015   was   $3.4 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , largely due to capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities during   2014   was   $2.5 billion  , largely due to changes in investments in time deposits.   Net contributions to   investments were   $0.5 billion   in   2016   compared with   net proceeds from   investments of   $0.6 billion   in   2015   and   $4.8 billion   in   2014  . Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, during   2016   was   $0.3 billion   compared with an insignificant amount in   2015   and   $0.2 billion   in   2014  . In   2016  , capital expenditures totaled   $2.6 billion  , up from   $2.5 billion   in   2015   and   $2.2 billion   in   2014  . We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be lower than   2016  . 
  Financing Activities   Cash used by financing activities was   $9.6 billion   during   2016  , an increase of   $1.7 billion   compared with   2015   primarily due to net borrowings in 2015 as well as higher share repurchases and dividend payments in 2016. Cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings in 2015 of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015, which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion. 
  During   2016  , we issued   $1.3 billion   and repaid   $1.4 billion   of debt. At   December 31, 2016   and   2015   the recorded balance of debt was   $10.0 billion   and   $10.0 billion   of which   $0.4 billion   and   $1.2 billion   was classified as short-term. At   December 31, 2016   and   2015   this included   $2.9 billion   and   $2.4 billion   of debt attributable to   BCC  , of which   $0.1 billion   and   $0.5 billion   were classified as short-term. 
  During   2016   and   2015   we repurchased   55.1 million   and   46.7 million   shares totaling   $7.0 billion   and   $6.8 billion   through our open market share repurchase program. In   2016 and 2015  , we had   0.7 million   shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At   December 31, 2016  , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 12, 2016, totaled   $14 billion  . 
  Capital Resources   We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout   2016   and at   December 31, 2016  , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have   $5.0 billion   of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. 
  Financing commitments totaled   $14.8 billion   and   $16.3 billion   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. 
  In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy  

39 

     Table of Contents  

existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. 
  At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , our pension plans were   $20.1 billion   and   $17.9 billion   underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an   Employee Retirement Income Security Act   (  ERISA  ) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at   December 31, 2016   with minimal required contributions in   2017  . We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately   $0.5 billion   in   2017  . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. 
  At   December 31, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of   December 31, 2016  , and the estimated timing thereof.

    Excludes income tax matters. As of   December 31, 2016  , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of   $1,557 million  , was   $1,169 million  . For further discussion of income taxes, see Note   4   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions.  
     Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits   Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to   ERISA   regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. 
  Purchase Obligations   Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. 
  Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position   Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation. 
  Industrial Participation Agreements   We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During   2016  , we incurred no such penalties. As of   December 31, 2016  , we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling   $18.1 billion   that extend through   2029  . Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.

Commercial Commitments 
  The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of   December 31, 2016  . 

Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note   11   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Contingent Obligations 
  We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: 
  Legal   Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note   20   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Environmental Remediation   We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of   $562 million   at   December 31, 2016  . For additional information, see Note   11   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note   12   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America   (  GAAP  ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs allocated to BDS segments are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally  

42 

     Table of Contents  

based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during   2016   was a benefit of   $217 million   compared with an expense of   $421 million   and   $1,469 million   in   2015   and   2014  . The   2016   benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements and curtailments. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management s Discussion and Analysis on pages   21   and   22   of this Form 10-K and see Note   21   to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Contract Accounting 
  Contract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.  
  Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. 
  Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by   $912 million   and   $224 million  . For the year ended December 31,   2014   net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by   $100 million  . 
  Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of   2016   had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately   $295 million  . In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. 
  Program Accounting 
  Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. 

44 

     Table of Contents  

Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. 
  To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. 
  The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized. 
  Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment s operating margins. For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings.    
  The 747 program was in a reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Deliveries of 747s in 2016 were recorded at a zero margin and absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, future 747 deliveries will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. It is reasonably possible that we could make a decision to terminate the 747 program, which may result in additional reach-forward losses which may be material. The 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2016. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost or future production rates were to change, we could be required to record reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments 
  We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. 
  We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. 
  The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. 
  We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1,   2016   and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31,   2016  , we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.  
  As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , we had   $490 million   of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
  Pension Plans 
  The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders  equity.

     Table of Contents  

The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of   December 31, 2016  . 

Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased   2016   net periodic pension expense by   $147 million  . We expect   2017   net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately   $214 million   and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately   $1,315 million   primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses. 
   
  Other 
  Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Act ), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.  
   
  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of   December 31, 2016  , the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At   December 31, 2016  , a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by   $226 million  . Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

  Note   1     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as  Boeing,  the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies for share-based payments to be recorded in the period shares vest or settle as income tax expense or benefit, rather than within Additional paid-in capital. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will be included in Net cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures and are not planning to change tax withholdings. 
  The Company prospectively adopted the standard during the second quarter of 2016 effective January 1, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase of   $105   to Net earnings and   $0.16   to diluted earnings per share. Adoption also resulted in a   $105   increase in Net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding   $105   reduction in Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
  Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016 - 02,   Leases     (Topic 842)  . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We do not expect the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  We plan to implement ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   in the first quarter of 2018. This comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding revenue and contracts with customers. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018 and apply it retrospectively to all periods presented. 
  We are analyzing the impact of the new standard on the Company s revenue contracts, comparing our current accounting policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard, and identifying potential differences that would result from applying the new standard to our contracts. We are also identifying and  

55 

     Table of Contents  

implementing changes to the Company s business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard in 2018 and recasting prior periods  financial information. 
  We expect adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our income statement and balance sheet but are unable to quantify those impacts at this time. We currently expect that most of our BDS contracts that currently recognize revenue as deliveries are made or based on the attainment of performance milestones will recognize revenue under the new standard as costs are incurred. Certain military derivative aircraft contracts in our Commercial Airplane business will also recognize revenue as costs are incurred. The new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts, only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized. We expect a corresponding acceleration in timing of cost of sales recognition for these contracts resulting in a decrease in Inventories from long-term contracts in progress upon adoption of the new standard.    
  We do not expect the new standard to affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our Commercial Airplane business. We will continue to recognize revenue for these contracts at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane.  
  From a balance sheet perspective we expect adoption of the new standard will increase Total Assets and Total Liabilities because netting of advances from customers against inventory will no longer be permitted. This will result in an increase in the Advances liability and Inventories from commercial aircraft programs upon adoption of the new standard. 
  Use of Estimates 
  Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Operating Cycle 
  For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is   generally longer than one year  . 
  Revenue and Related Cost Recognition 
  Contract Accounting   Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by Defense, Space   Security (  BDS  ). The majority of business conducted by BDS is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that extend over several years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized. 
  Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract s percent complete. In   2016   and   2015  , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by   $912   and   $224   and diluted EPS by   $1.25   and   $0.23  . In   2014   net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by   $100   and diluted EPS by   $0.10  . Significant adjustments during the three  

56 

     Table of Contents  

years ended December 31,   2016   included reach-forward losses of   $1,128  ,   $835   and   $425   on the   USAF KC-46A Tanker   contract recorded during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  . 
  We combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. These essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. When a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. Similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract. 
  Sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. 
  Program Accounting   Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. Program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units  expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. 
  We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. See Note   11  . 
  Concession Sharing Arrangements   We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. 
  Spare Parts Revenue   We recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. 

57 

     Table of Contents  

Service Revenue   Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of U.S. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. Service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, space travel on Commercial Crew, ongoing maintenance of International Space Station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. Service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered. 
  Financial Services Revenue   We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable. 
  Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. 
  For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. 
  For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note. 
  Reinsurance Revenue   Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers  compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members  individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were   $147  ,   $136   and   $135   during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were   $139  ,   $132   and   $144   during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Fleet Support 
  We provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. This activity continues throughout the aircraft s operational life. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.

Research and Development 
  Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of   $311  ,   $286   and   $289   in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  We have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. Our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. In each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. The amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. In the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in Accrued liabilities until earned. 
  Share-Based Compensation 
  We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. 
  Income Taxes 
  Provisions for federal, state, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. 
  The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax expense.

Postretirement Plans 
  The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders  equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
  Postemployment Plans 
  We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated. 
  Environmental Remediation 
  We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were   $77   and   $163   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Inventories 
  Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe  

60 

     Table of Contents  

benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering. 
  Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process. 
  The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. 
  Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. See  Aircraft Valuation  within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs. 
  Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period. 
  We net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in Advances and billings in excess of related costs. 
  Precontract Costs 
  We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying Consolidated  

61 

     Table of Contents  

Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from   10   to   40   years; and new machinery and equipment, from   4   to   20   years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years  digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over   5   years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. 
  Long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material. 
  We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability s fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g., asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles 
  Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. 
  We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. 

62 

     Table of Contents  

Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. 
  Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from   4   to   14   years; product know-how, from   3   to   30   years; customer base, from   3   to   17   years; distribution rights, from   3   to   27   years; and other, from   2   to   32   years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. 
  Investments 
  Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost. 
  Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly.  
  The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between   20%   and   50%  . 
  We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. Earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(expense), net. 
  Derivatives 
  All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these  

63 

     Table of Contents  

aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately. 
  Aircraft Valuation 
  Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments   In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price,   generally 10 to 15 years   after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments. 
  Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of: 
           (1) 
    adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or 
              (2) 
    charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. 
     The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer s requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. 
  Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing. 
  Customer financing   Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. 
  We assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets  carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. 

64 

     Table of Contents  

We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. 
  Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease   We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 
  When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. 
  Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables   We record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables. 
  We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize. 
  We review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. 
  We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. 
  Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.

Warranties 
  In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a   three   to   four  -year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs  estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. These sales are generally accompanied by a   six   month to   two  -year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. 
  We provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs  estimate at completion. 
  Supplier Penalties 
  We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts. 
  Guarantees 
  We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantee s inception. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount.

Note   2     Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles 
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015   were as follows: 

(1)     
    The increase in goodwill is primarily the result of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary. 
     As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of   $490   relating to trade names. 
  The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets were as follows at December 31: 

Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015   was   $220   and   $224  . Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows:  

During   2016   and   2015   we acquired   $113   and   $15   of finite-lived intangible assets, of which   $31   and   $0   related to non-cash investing and financing transactions.

Note   3     Earnings Per Share  
  Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. 
  Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 
  The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: 

(1)   
    Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. 
     The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. These shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was either antidilutive or the performance condition was not met.

Income tax expense/(benefit) consisted of the following: 

Net income tax payments were   $1,460  ,   $1,490   and   $355   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of   35%   to our effective income tax rates: 

(1)   
    In the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2014, we recorded incremental tax benefits of   $440   and   $265   related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis adjustment). 
               (2)   
    Throughout 2016, we recorded tax benefits of   $105   as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which required excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments to be recorded through tax expense.

Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2013-2014 federal tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2016 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. 
  Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: 

(1)    
    Of the deferred tax asset for net operating loss and credit carryovers,   $262   expires on or before December 31, 2036 and   $15   may be carried over indefinitely.  
      Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows: 

The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
  We have provided for U.S. deferred income taxes and foreign withholding tax in the amount of   $32   on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately   $850   because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution. 
  As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014  .

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

As of   December 31  ,   2016, 2015 and 2014  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was   $1,557  ,   $1,617   and   $1,312  , respectively, of which   $1,402  ,   $1,479   and   $1,180   would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of   December 31, 2016  , these amounts are primarily associated with U.S. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit, tax basis adjustments and U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed. 
   
  Note   5     Accounts Receivable, net 
  Accounts receivable at   December 31   consisted of the following:   

            (1)   
    Excludes U.S. government contracts 
     The following table summarizes our accounts receivable under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of   December 31  : 

Under contract accounting unbillable receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. Any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. Factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customer s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. Unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were     $172   and   $178   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . Accounts

  Note   6     Inventories 
  Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following:   

  Long-Term Contracts in Progress 
  Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to   United Launch Alliance   (  ULA  ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the inventory balance was   $120   (net of advances of   $220  ) and   $120   (net of advances of   $310  ). See indemnifications to ULA in Note   12  . 
  Included in inventories are capitalized precontract costs of   $729   and   $732   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and C-17. See Note   11  .  
  Commercial Aircraft Programs 
  At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program:   $32,501   and   $34,656   of work in process (including deferred production costs of   $27,308   and   $28,510  ),   $2,398   and   $2,551   of supplier advances, and   $3,625   and   $3,890   of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At   December 31, 2016  ,   $23,818   of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and   $7,115   is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders.  
  During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that it was unlikely we would receive firm orders for two flight test aircraft that were produced in 2009 and   a  ccordingly reclassified associated costs of   $1,235   from 787 program inventory to research and development expense. The reclassification also impacted 787 deferred production costs, reducing the balance by   $1,011   at June 30, 2016.  
  At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program:   $35   and   $942   of deferred production costs, net of reach-forward losses, and   $284   and   $377   of unamortized tooling costs. At   December 31, 2016  ,   $233   of 747 deferred production and unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and   $86   is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , work in process inventory included a number of completed 747 aircraft that we expect to recover from future orders.

     Table of Contents  

Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling   $3,117   and   $3,166   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Used aircraft in inventories at Commercial Airplanes totaled   $150     and   $267     at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  .  
   
  Note   7     Customer Financing 
  Customer financing primarily relates to the Boeing Capital (BCC) segment and consisted of the following at December 31: 

The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows:   

  Operating lease equipment primarily includes large commercial jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft. At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , operating lease equipment included   $6   and   $49   available for sale or re-lease. At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , we had firm lease commitments for   $0   and   $15   of this equipment. 
  Financing receivable balances evaluated for impairment at December 31 were as follows: 

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At   December 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of   $55   and   $86  , of which   $44   and   $0   were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables. 
  Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer  .   The average recorded investment  

73 

     Table of Contents  

in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 was   $41   and the related interest income was insignificant.   
  The change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014  , consisted of the following: 

The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies.  
  Our financing receivable balances at December 31 by internal credit rating category are shown below: 

At   December 31, 2016  , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged   12.7%  ,   8.8%   and   1.1%   to the exposure associated with those receivables. 
  Customer Financing Exposure 
  Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.

Note   10     Other Assets 
  Sea Launch 
  At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , Other assets included   $356   of receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch s bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The   $356   includes   $147   related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and   $209   related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia (RSC Energia)     $223  , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine     $89   and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine     $44  . 
  On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the   $147   bank guarantee payment and the   $209   partner loan obligations. On May 12, 2016, the court issued a judgment in favor of Boeing relating to the bank guarantee payment and the partner loan obligations.  
  In December 2016, we reached an agreement which we believe will enable us to recover the outstanding receivable balance from RSC Energia over the next several years. The agreement is subject to certain contingencies which we expect will be resolved during the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners   in connection with the court judgment and continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement from the Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation. 
    
  Spirit AeroSystems 
  As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , Other assets included   $143   and   $140   of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees that were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We expect to fully recover from Spirit. 
   
  Note   11     Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies 
  Accrued Liabilities 
  Accrued liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following:

     Table of Contents  

Environmental 
  The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 

The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by   $857   and   $853  . 
  Product Warranties 
  The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 

Commercial Aircraft Commitments 
  In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. 
  Trade-in commitment agreements at   December 31, 2016   have expiration dates from   2017   through   2026  . At   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , total contractual trade-in commitments were   $1,485   and   $1,585  . As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling   $126   and   $240   and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was   $126   and   $240  .

Financing Commitments 
  Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled   $14,847   and   $16,283   as of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of   December 31, 2016   are as follows: 

As of   December 31, 2016  , all of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. 
  Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds 
  We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately   $4,701   and   $4,968   as of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Commitments to ULA 
  We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of   December 31, 2016  , ULA s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was   $120  . See Note   6  . 
  F/A-18 
  At   December 31, 2016  , our backlog included   23   F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy and funding has been authorized and appropriated for an additional   12   aircraft. In addition, Kuwait has requested up to   40   aircraft. We have begun work or authorized suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond those already in backlog in anticipation of these future orders. At December 31, 2016, we had   $57   of capitalized precontract costs and   $790   of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with F/A-18 aircraft.

Company Owned Life Insurance 
  McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the cash surrender value was   $483   and   $487   and the total loans were   $456   and   $456  . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
   
  United States Government Defense Environment Overview 
  The new U.S. administration and key members of the 115th Congress have expressed a general desire to reverse the effects of the budgetary reductions of the past several years. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act), which mandated limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, remains in effect through the 2021 government fiscal year causing budget uncertainty and continued risk of future sequestration cuts.     
  In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.    
  Funding timeliness also remains a risk as the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on April 28, 2017. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.    
   
  BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts 
  Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during 2016, we have recorded additional reach-forward losses of   $1,128   on the KC-46A Tanker program and a charge of   $162   resulting from a reach-forward loss of   $38   on the Commercial Crew Program. Moreover, both of these programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs. 

80 

     Table of Contents  

KC-46A Tanker    
  In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at   $4.9 billion   and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In August 2016, the   USAF   authorized LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at   $2.8 billion  . At   December 31, 2016  , we had approximately   $311   of capitalized precontract costs and   $1,016   of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. 
  Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts  
  Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. 
   
  Russia/Ukraine 
  We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 
   
  747 Program 
  Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of   1.0   aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from   1,574   to   1,555   aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted in a reach-forward loss of   $1,188   in the second quarter. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of   $885   and   $70   during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively, related to the prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We reduced the rate from   1.0   to   0.5   per month in   September 2016  . The adjusted program accounting quantity includes   26   undelivered aircraft, currently scheduled to be produced through 2019. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 
  787 Program 
  The 787 program continued to have near breakeven gross margins. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability. We are continuing to monitor wide-body demand and if sufficient orders do not materialize during the next several quarters we may consider appropriate adjustments to planned production rates. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rates and productivity improvements,  

81 

     Table of Contents  

supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could record a reach-forward loss that may be material.  
   
  Note   12     Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
  We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. 
  The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a  worst-case scenario,  and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. 

Contingent Repurchase Commitments   The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. 
  Indemnifications to ULA   In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of   $1,360   of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus   $1,860   of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on   March 31, 2021  . Since inception, ULA has consumed   $1,283   of the   $1,360   of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume   $77  . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of   $1,472   through   December 31, 2016  . ULA has made payments of   $1,740   to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made   $63   of net indemnification payments to ULA.  
  We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the USAF for   four   satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing for each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the USAF appealed the ASBCA s ruling. If the USAF s appeal of the ASBCA's ruling is successful, and ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to   $261   and may record up to   $277   in pre-tax losses associated with the   three   missions.

Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include   $85   related to deferred support costs and   $91   related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that   $271   of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional   $114   of deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA s certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. government s counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to   $317   of the costs questioned by the DCMA. 
  Other Indemnifications   In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note   11  . 
  Credit Guarantees   We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next   four   years. 
  Industrial Revenue Bonds 
  Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita and St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita and St. Louis sites. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue, and a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  
  During 2016, the City of Wichita IRBs were settled. As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were   $64   and   $584  . 
   
  Note   13     Debt 
  On   May 18, 2016  , we issued   $1,200   of fixed rate senior notes consisting of   $400   due   June 15, 2023   that bear an annual interest rate of   1.875%  ,   $400   due   June 15, 2026   that bear an annual interest rate of   2.25%  , and   $400   due   June 15, 2046   that bear an annual interest rate of   3.375%  . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated

Total Company interest payments were   $523  ,   $488   and   $511   for the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. 
  We have   $5,000   currently available under credit line agreements, of which   $2,480   is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in   November 2017  ,   $2,370   expires in   November 2021  ,   $90     expires in   November 2019   and   $60   expires in   November 2017  . The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements.

Note   14     Postretirement Plans 
  The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016.  
  We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans  participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments. 
  We also have other postretirement benefits (OPB) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.  
  The components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: 

In   2016  , we recorded charges of   $40     related to curtailments and other benefit changes associated with certain of our defined benefit plans.

The estimated amount that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the year ending   December 31, 2017   is as follows: 

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all pension plans was   $74,240   and   $72,330   at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . Key information for our plans with ABO in excess of plan assets as of December 31 was as follows: 

Assumptions 
  The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year. 

The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans  expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. A portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. Since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. The present value of each plan s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. All bonds are U.S. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50. 
  The pension fund s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a   five  -year moving average of plan assets. As of   December 31, 2016  , the MRVA was approximately   $2,352   greater than the fair market value of assets.

Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: 

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. To determine the health care cost trend rates we look at a combination of information including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect:

Plan Assets 
  Investment Strategy   The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. 
  We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. 
  Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis. 
  The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Fixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations. 
  Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. 
  Hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy. 
  Investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. Certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. 
  As a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were   6.0%   and   13.1%   for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and   1.2%   and   4.0%   for global equity and commodities at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Risk Management   In managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing  . 
  Fair Value Measurements   The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

     Table of Contents  

Fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a security s relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads. 
  Common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their NAVs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. 
  Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.  
  Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. 
  Real estate and real asset NAV valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs) NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Publicly traded REITs and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table. 
  Hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds and fund-of-fund limited liability company (LLC) structures. For direct hedge funds the NAVs are generally based on valuation of the underlying investments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. The NAVs of the fund-of-funds are based on the NAVs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. Redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds. 
  Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner (GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations.

The changes in unrealized gains/(losses) for Level 3 mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities still held at   December 31, 2016   and   2015   were   $4     and     ($10)  . 
  OPB Plan Assets   The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately   60%   equities and   40%   debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost. 
  Cash Flows 
  Contributions   Required pension contributions under the   Employee Retirement Income Security Act   (  ERISA  ), as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are expected to be   $200   in   2017  . In   2017   we expect to make contributions to our pension plans of approximately   $500  .   
  Estimated Future Benefit Payments   The table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants  share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. OPB payments reflect our portion only. 

Termination Provisions 
  Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by   ERISA  , and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs. 
  Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan s assets exceed that plan s obligations, the U.S. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan s assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts. 
  Defined Contribution Plans 
  We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense for these defined contribution plans was   $1,413  ,   $768   and   $764   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. 
   
  Note   15     Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements 
  Share-Based Compensation 
  Our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is   87,000,000  .

     Table of Contents  

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during   2017  . 
  Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows: 

Stock Options 
  We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire   ten   years after the date of grant. The stock options vest over a period of   three   years and were fully vested at   December 31, 2016  , except for   6,221   shares which vested in January 2017.  
  Stock option activity for the year ended   December 31, 2016   is as follows: 

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014   was   $265  ,   $385   and   $250  , respectively. Cash received from options exercised during the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014   was   $321  ,   $399   and   $343   with a related tax benefit of   $94  ,   $135   and   $87  , respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. The grant date fair value of stock options vested during the   years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014   was   $27  ,   $56   and   $87  , respectively. 
  Restricted Stock Units 
  In February   2016, 2015 and 2014  , we granted to our executives   777,837  ,   590,778   and   695,651     restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of   $117.50  ,   $154.64   and   $129.58   per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary)  

94 

     Table of Contents  

will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant.  
  RSU activity for the year ended   December 31, 2016   was as follows: 

The number of vested but undistributed RSUs at   December 31, 2016   was not significant. 
  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company s total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from   0%   to   200%   of the initial PBRSU grant, but will not exceed   400%   of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. 
  In February   2016, 2015 and 2014  , we granted to our executives   721,176  ,   556,203   and   662,215   PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents.

Other Compensation Arrangements 
  Performance Awards 
  Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit has an initial value of   $100   dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from   $0   to   $200   dollars per unit, depending on the Company s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period. 
  During   2016, 2015 and 2014  , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each   three  -year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is   $0   and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the   2016, 2015 and 2014   Performance Awards is   $338  ,   $322   and   $315  , respectively. The   2014   grant is expected to be paid out in cash in   March 2017  . 
  Deferred Compensation 
  The Company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. Participants can diversify deferred compensation among   23   investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account. 
  Total expense related to deferred compensation was   $46  ,   $63   and   $44   in   2016, 2015 and 2014  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  , the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was   $1,126   and   $1,191  . 
   
  Note   16     Shareholders  Equity 
  On   December 12, 2016  , the Board approved a new repurchase plan for up to   $14,000   of common stock, replacing the previously authorized program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated.  
  As of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , there were   1,200,000,000   shares of common stock and   20,000,000   shares of preferred stock authorized. No preferred stock has been issued.

  Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. 
  Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment 
  We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
  Notional Amounts and Fair Values 
  The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 were as follows:

Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of   $101   (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the years ended   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . 
  We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at   December 31, 2016   was   $46  . At   December 31, 2016  , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives. 
   
  Note   18     Significant Group Concentrations of Risk 
  Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments involving potential credit risk are predominantly with commercial aircraft customers and the U.S. government. Of the   $13,108   in gross accounts receivable and gross customer financing included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of   December 31, 2016  ,   $6,380   related predominantly to commercial aircraft customers (  $2,175   of accounts receivable and   $4,205   of customer financing) and   $4,639   related to the U.S. government. 
  Of the   $4,211   in gross customer financing,   $2,760   related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit including Volga Dnepr Affiliates, Silk Way Airlines and American Airlines who were associated with   18%  ,   9%   and   6%  , respectively, of our financing portfolio. Financing for aircraft is collateralized by security in the related asset and in some instances security in other assets as well. 
  Other Risk 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , approximately   38%   of our total workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements.

Note   19     Fair Value Measurements 
  The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.  

Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.  
  Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. 
  Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: 

The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party  

100 

     Table of Contents  

aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets.  
  For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended   December 31, 2016  , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets. 

(1)   
    The range represents the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, according to the third party aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process. 
               (2)   
    The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. 
     Fair Value Disclosures 
  The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31 were as follows: 

101 

     Table of Contents  

The fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). 
   
  Note   20     Legal Proceedings 
  Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. 
  In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
   
  Note   21     Segment Information 
  We operate in   five   principal segments: Commercial Airplanes;   Boeing Military Aircraft   (  BMA  ),   Network   Space Systems   (  N SS  ), and   Global Services   Support   (  GS S  ), collectively   Defense, Space   Security  ; and   Boeing Capital   (BCC). All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page   54   for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. 
  The Commercial Airplanes segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides related support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. 
  Our   BMA   segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for global strike, including fighter aircraft and missile systems; vertical lift including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; mobility, surveillance and engagement, including battle management, airborne, anti-submarine, transport and tanker aircraft. 
  Our   N SS   segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: strategic defense and intelligence systems, including strategic missile and defense systems, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), cyber and information solutions, and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration. 
  Our   GS S   segment provides customers with mission readiness through total support solutions. Our global services business sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance,  

102 

     Table of Contents  

modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training.  
  Our   BCC   segment facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.  
  Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing s global business operations, as well as technical and functional capabilities, including information technology, research and development, test and evaluation, technology strategy development, environmental remediation management and intellectual property management. It also includes intercompany guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between BCA, BCC and BDS. 
  In November 2016, we announced plans for the formation of Boeing Global Services (BGS), which will bring together certain Commercial Aviation Services businesses, currently included in the Commercial Airplanes segment, and certain BDS businesses (primarily those currently included in the GS S segment). We expect Boeing Global Services to be operational during the second half of 2017. We will continue to report using the existing segment structure until BGS is operational and has discrete financial information that is being provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. 
  While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors are located in Europe and Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consisted of the following: 

Revenues from the U.S. government (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government), primarily recorded at BDS, represented   23%  ,   27%   and   30%   of consolidated revenues for   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Approximately   4%   of operating assets were located outside the United States as of   December 31, 2016 and 2015  . The information in the following tables is derived directly from the segments  internal financial reporting used for corporate management purposes.

Depreciation and Amortization 

Capital Expenditures 

Unallocated capital expenditures relate primarily to assets managed centrally on behalf of the five principal segments. 
  We recorded Earnings from operations associated with our cost and equity method investments of   $46  ,   $64   and   $58   in our Commercial Airplanes segment and   $257  ,   $210   and   $229   in BDS, primarily in our N SS segment, for the years ended December 31,   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  For segment reporting purposes, we record Commercial Airplanes segment revenues and cost of sales for airplanes transferred to other segments. Such transfers may include airplanes accounted for as operating leases and considered transferred to the BCC segment and airplanes transferred to the BDS segment for further modification prior to delivery to the customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items and eliminations caption. For segment reporting purposes, we record BDS revenues and cost of sales for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes when the airplane is delivered to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. 
  Intersegment revenues, eliminated in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, are shown in the following table. 

104 

     Table of Contents  

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other 
  Unallocated items, eliminations and other includes costs not attributable to business segments as well as intercompany profit eliminations. We generally allocate costs to business segments based on the U.S. federal cost accounting standards. Components of Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table. 

Unallocated Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense 
  Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense represents the portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Pension costs, comprising   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America   (  GAAP  ) service and prior service costs, are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs are allocated to BDS using   U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards   (  CAS  ), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than   GAAP  . These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to business segments based on   CAS  , which is generally based on benefits paid.  
  Assets 
  Segment assets are summarized in the table below. 

Assets included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily consist of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term and other investments, Deferred tax assets, capitalized interest and assets held centrally as well as intercompany eliminations.

Note   22     Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) 

Gross profit is calculated as Total revenues minus Total costs and expenses. Total costs and expenses includes Cost of products, Cost of services and Boeing Capital interest expense. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of   $1,188  ,   $70   and   $885  , respectively, on the 747 program.   
  During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft for the 787 program are not commercially saleable, and we reclassified costs of   $1,235   associated with these aircraft from 787 program inventory to research and development expense. 
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, second quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2016, and second quarter of 2015, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the U.S. Air Force resulted in reach-forward losses of   $312  ,   $573  ,   $243   and   $835  , respectively.

The financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries as of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2016  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
  The Boeing Company 
  Chicago, Illinois 
  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   December 31, 2016  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2016  , based on the criteria established in   Internal Control   Integrated Framework     (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2016   of the Company and our report dated   February 8, 2017   expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES 
  OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  (As Amended and Restated October 31, 2016) 
           1.

   Board of Directors  means the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company; 
   Code  means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
   Company  means The Boeing Company; 
   Committee  means the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors; 
   Section 162(m)  means Code Section 162(m), including any proposed and final regulations and other guidance issued thereunder by the Department of the Treasury and/or the Internal Revenue Service.

           2. 
    Committee 
     The Committee shall have full power and authority to administer the Plan, and to construe and interpret its terms and provisions.  Decisions of the Committee shall be final and binding upon all parties. 
           3. 
    Eligibility 
     3.1     Certain Employees.    Officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who hold executive, administrative, managerial, supervisory, technical or other key positions shall be eligible for participation under the Plan, and participants shall for the most part be selected from among members of this group. None of the members of the Committee and no director of the Company or of a Subsidiary who is not also an officer or employee of the Company or of a Subsidiary shall be eligible for participation under the Plan. 
  3.2     Special Contributors; Former Employees.    Awards may also be made under the Plan to employees not holding executive, administrative, supervisory, technical or other key positions who have, nevertheless, made a substantial contribution to the success of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  In addition, a former employee who has either  
  (a)        retired under the employee retirement plan of the Company or of a Subsidiary or  
  (b)         left the service of the Company or of a Subsidiary to enter the armed services or for such other reasons as may be determined by the Committee 
  and who would have been eligible for an award but for such retirement or termination of service, may be eligible for an award for the year in which such employee retires or so leaves the service of  

the Company or of a Subsidiary.  In the case of a former employee who would have been eligible for an award but for death, an award may be granted to the surviving spouse or children or to the estate of such former employee, as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. 
  3.3     Covered Employees  .  In no event shall any individual who is a  covered employee  (as defined in Section 162(m)) be eligible to receive an award under the Plan that is intended to meet the qualification requirements of Section 162(m).  
           4. 
    Making Awards 
     4.1     Committee Authority.    The Committee shall make awards, subject to the limitations herein, to such individuals within the eligible group and in such amounts and at such times as, in the Committee s judgment, shall best serve the interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries at that time, taking into account each individual s job performance and contributions to the success of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 
  Except as provided in Section 4.2, the Committee shall have complete discretion in determining to whom awards under the Plan shall be made; provided, however, in making awards the Committee shall request and consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and others whom it may designate. 
  4.2        Delegation of Award-Making Authority and Award Recommendations.    The Committee may, at such time or times as it may elect, authorize the Chief Executive Officer of the Company who in turn may authorize other executives of the Company to make additional awards subject to the limitations herein provided, in amounts not exceeding an aggregate amount and under conditions determined by the Committee. In making recommendations to the Committee and in making awards authorized by the Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall request and consider the recommendations of other officers and supervisory employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 
  4.3        Forms of Awards.    Awards under this Plan will be made entirely in cash.  
  4.4        Boeing Stock Units  .  Boeing Stock Units granted under the Plan prior to the May 1, 2006 shall continue to be subject to the provisions of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to such date. 
    
  4.5     Limits on Awards.    Unless approved by two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors, no participant shall receive an award under the Plan in any one calendar year that has a maximum target of more than two (2) times the participant s base salary for the year for which the award is made, and a maximum payout of more than two (2) times the target established by the Committee for the year for which the award is made.   
           5. 
    Distribution of Awards 
     5.1     Terms; Timing.    Distribution of awards shall be governed by the terms and conditions applicable to such awards, as determined by the Committee or its delegate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any award intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A which is to be paid out when vested and qualify for the short-term deferral exemption to Section 409A, such payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the award became vested, but in no event shall such payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the award became vested unless (i) deferred pursuant to Section 5.2 or (ii) otherwise permitted under the exemption provisions of Section 409A.  

5.2.        Deferred Payment  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, the Committee may permit or require a participant to defer receipt of the payment of an award to the extent provided under any deferred compensation plan of the Company or pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement, either of which satisfies the requirements for exemption from or complies with Section 409A.  
  5.3        Deductions.    The Company shall deduct from the payment of each award any withholdings required by law; and the Company may deduct any amounts due from the recipient to the Company or a Subsidiary.  
  5.4        Notice; Distribution Date.    The Committee or its delegates shall advise participants of their awards under the Plan, and shall fix the distribution date or dates for such awards. Awards shall be paid on the distribution date or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.  
           6. 
    Repeal; Amendments.   The Plan and any and all provisions hereof may be repealed or amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors at any meeting if the notice of such meetings sets forth the form of the proposal for such repeal or amendment or a summary thereof. No repeal or amendment of the Plan shall operate to annul or modify any award previously made under the Plan.

SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PLAN 
  FOR EMPLOYEES OF 
  THE BOEING COMPANY 
  AS AMENDED AND RESTATED ON OCTOBER 30, 2016  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 

i 

ii 

ARTICLE I 
  Introduction 
    
  The Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company (Plan) was originally established effective January 1, 1978, by The Boeing Company.  The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2008, to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code).  The Plan was subsequently amended and restated as of January 1, 2009, for the purpose of expanding the Restoration Benefit, and for the purpose of adding an Executive SBP+ Company Contribution and a DC SERP benefit.  The Plan is again being amended and restated on October [  ], effective as of January 1, 2016, for the purpose of making clarifying changes to the Plan, eliminating certain provisions that are no longer applicable, and adding a new Appendix B to the Plan to list the entities whose employees are excluded from Plan participation. 
  The Plan provides three separate benefits:   
           (i) 
    the Restoration Benefit, the purpose of which is to restore the benefits of certain employees under The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment Plan, to the extent that these qualified plan benefits are limited by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code;   
              (ii) 
    the Executive SBP+ Company Contribution, the purpose of which is to provide an additional contribution to this Plan, equal to a percentage of the annual incentive plan payments for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, in lieu of a portion of the VIP+ Company Contribution under the VIP; and  
              (iii) 
    the DC SERP Benefit, the purpose of which is to provide a supplemental retirement benefit for a select group of management or highly compensated employees at level E-1 through E-3 who are hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009, and for a select group of management and highly compensated employees who were hired or rehired before January 1, 2009. 
     For periods prior to January 1, 1999, the Plan also restored participants  benefits under The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan and The Boeing Company Employee Financial Security Plan, to the extent these benefits were limited by sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Code.  For the period January 1, 1987 through May 31, 1987, the Plan also restored benefits reduced by the limitation on elective deferrals imposed by section 402(g)(1) of the Code. 
  It is intended that the Plan shall be an excess benefit plan as defined in section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), to the extent benefits are paid in excess of the limits imposed by section 415 of the Code.  To the extent any part of the Plan is not an excess benefit plan, it is intended that the Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

           (A) 
    The Employee is eligible to participate in the VIP during such Plan Year. 
              (B) 
    The Employee is, during the Plan Year, a salaried Employee of the Company who either is (i) not represented by a collective bargaining agent or (ii) represented by a collective bargaining agent where the terms of the collective bargaining agreement covering such Employee specifically provide for coverage under the Plan. 
              (C) 
    As of October 1   st    of the prior Plan Year, the Employee s Base Salary for the prior Plan Year equaled or exceeded the amount calculated as follows (rounded down to the nearest $1,000 increment): 
     The dollar limit imposed by section 415(c) of the Code for the prior Plan Year, divided by the percentage equal to the sum of (i), (ii), and (iii), as applicable. 
           (i) 
    The maximum percentage that an Employee can elect to contribute on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth basis under the VIP, for the prior Plan Year (or such other rate approved by the Committee by October 1   st    to take effect under the VIP as of the following January).

Deferral Contributions and Company Matching Contributions are described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 below. 
  An Eligible Employee who receives a VIP+ Company Contribution under the VIP will also, to the extent eligible, become a Participant in the Restoration Benefit program when he or she elects to receive an SBP+ Company Contribution for a Plan Year, by executing and delivering a timely SBP+ Company Contribution Election in accordance with subsections (A)-(C) below.

Likewise, an Employee eligible for any portion of the Restoration Benefit provided under this Article III remains subject to restrictions on mid-year contribution election changes under the VIP, in accordance with the terms of the VIP. 
  See Section 3.7 for a limited exception to the general rule on the irrevocability of Deferral Elections, in the event of Unforeseeable Emergency.

    No Mid-Year Elections 
     An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year (as a new hire, rehire or due to raise or promotion) will not be eligible to make Deferral Contributions or to receive SBP+ Company Contributions under the Restoration Benefit program during such Plan Year. 
  3.3        Deferral Contributions 
  An Eligible Employee may elect to defer a percentage of his or her Compensation otherwise payable by the Company for a Plan Year by executing and delivering a Deferral Election, as described in Section 3.2 above.  This percentage is limited to the maximum percentage described in Section 3.1(C)(i), as applicable to the Eligible Employee. 
  Deferral Contributions will be made from the Participant s Compensation only to the extent that either:  (i) Compensation for the applicable Plan Year exceeds the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, or (ii) the Participant s annual additions under the VIP for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code section 415(c), as indexed. 
  Deferral Contributions will be credited to the Participant s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible. 
  3.4        Company Matching Contributions 
  A Participant in the Restoration Benefit program who defers Compensation under Section 3.3 will be credited with a Company Matching Contribution from the Company.  This Company Matching Contribution will equal a percentage (determined based on the matching contribution formula applicable to the Participant under the VIP for the Plan Year) of the Participant s Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, subject to a limit on the Participant s Compensation from which Deferral Contributions are made under this Restoration Benefit program for the Plan Year. This percentage is limited, however, to the maximum percentage described in Section 3.1(C)(ii), as applicable to the Participant.  
  Company Matching Contributions will be credited to the Participant s Account on the date that the underlying Deferral Contribution is credited to the Participant s Account. 
  3.5        SBP+ Company Contributions

  The SBP+ Company Contribution for a Plan Year will equal a percentage of the Participant s Compensation during the applicable pay periods within such Plan Year.  This percentage will be equal to the VIP+ Company Contribution percentage for which the Participant is eligible for such pay period under the VIP.   
  3.6        Vesting 
  A Participant s interest in his or her Account attributable to Restoration Benefits generally will be 100% vested at all times. 
  See Section 7.4 regarding missing participants and improper credits, Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment, and Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan. 
  3.7        Cancellation of Deferral Election Due to Unforeseeable Emergency 
  Notwithstanding the election procedures described in Section 3.3, a Participant in the Restoration Benefit program will be permitted to cancel an existing Deferral Election with regard to a Plan Year during that Plan Year, if the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, as determined by the Committee. 
  If a Participant has elected and received a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 6.1(H), the Participant will be deemed to have elected to cancel his or her Deferral Election for the remainder of the applicable Plan Year.

   11 

4.5        Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Forfeiture Rules 
  The Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that a Participant will forfeit any part or all of the portion of his or her Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Benefit that is attributable to Executive SBP+ Company Contributions made on and after January 1, 2017, if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Company or within five (5) years after termination of such employment: 
           (A) 
    The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests.  For purposes of this Plan,  other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests  shall include any other unlawful act (i) committed against the Company, or the interests of the Company, including, but not limited to, a governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Company, or a customer of the Company, or (ii) affecting the Company or the interests of the Company, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Company or the interests of the Company, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
              (B) 
    The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or otherwise, which the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is  engaging in competition  with any significant aspect of Company business.  For purposes of this Plan,  engaging in competition  shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with any Company business or that takes a position adverse to any Company business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company, all as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
              (C) 
    The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (or successor position thereto), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company s employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with the Company, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Participant or any third party. 
              (D) 
    The Participant disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Company, its products, or its employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings. 
     
   12 

(E) 
    The Participant uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Company.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings. 
     To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of such portion of his or her Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Benefit, the Committee will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover such Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Benefit.  The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable, and as so amended shall continue in effect. 
  In addition, the Committee will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Benefit attributable to Executive SBP+ Company Contributions made on and after January 1, 2017, which are attributable to an incentive award that the Company seeks to recover under the clawback provision of any plan providing Executive Incentive Pay.

ARTICLE V 
  DC SERP      Eligibility and Benefits 
  5.1        DC SERP Eligibility 
  An Employee is eligible to participate in the DC SERP for a Plan Year for so long as he or she is on the E-Series Payroll   and   satisfies the conditions in either (A) or (B) below: 
  For purposes of determining eligibility for the DC SERP, the term  hired  has the meaning assigned in the VIP for purposes of determining eligibility for Company Contributions thereunder, regardless of the date on which the Employee joins the E-Series Payroll. 
   An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (A) if: 
            (ii) 
    The Employee is ineligible to accrue benefits under any defined benefit plan maintained by the Company, and 
              (iii) 
    The Employee is on the E-Series Payroll with a level of E-1 through E-3. 
      An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (B) if the Employee was hired before January 1, 2009. 
  In the event that an Employee subsequently terminates employment and is  hired  on or after January 1, 2016, as defined in the VIP for purposes of determining eligibility for Company Contributions thereunder, such Participant will be reclassified as hired on or after January 1, 2009 under subsection (A) above. 
  5.2        DC SERP Participation 
  An Eligible Employee will become a Participant in the DC SERP on the date the Employee satisfies the eligibility conditions in Section 5.1. 
  A rehired Employee who previously participated in the Plan will become a Participant again on the date the Employee satisfies the eligibility conditions in Section 5.1 again after rehire. 
  
   14 

5.3        DC SERP Benefits 
  Each Participant in the DC SERP shall be entitled to benefits under this Plan as described below.   
           (A) 
    Payroll Contributions 
     Contributions will be credited to the Participant s Account on the date the Compensation and Executive Incentive Pay otherwise would be payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible. 
   A Participant described in Section 5.1(A) (Hired On or After 2009) will receive a DC SERP contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant s Compensation and Executive Incentive Pay, for each applicable pay period.  The Contribution Credit for a pay period is determined by the Participant s level as of such pay period as follows: 
           (a) 
    2%, for a Participant at level E-2 through E-3. 
              (b) 
    4%, for a Participant at level E-1. 
     If a Participant changes levels during a pay period, the Participant s level as in effect on the last day of the pay period will apply.  For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant s Compensation and Executive Incentive Pay will be counted solely to the extent that (i) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll during the applicable pay period or (ii) such Executive Incentive Pay is paid after a Participant s termination of employment from the Company but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular paycheck.  
   A Participant described in Section 5.1(B) (Hired Before 2009) will receive a DC SERP contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant s Compensation and Executive Incentive Pay, for each applicable pay period.  For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant s Compensation and Executive Incentive Pay will be counted solely to the extent that (i) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll during the applicable pay period or (ii) such Executive Incentive Pay is paid after a Participant s termination of employment from the Company but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular paycheck  
  The Contribution Credit will equal the sum of (a) and, if applicable, (b): 
  
   15 

(b) 
    For a Participant who has attained age 55 (or will attain age 55 by the end of a Plan Year), 0.5% times the Participant s whole years of Benefit Service (as defined under the PVP and/or BSS Plan, as applicable, and determined as of January 1, 2016), subject to the limitation herein.  The supplemental percentage credited under this subsection (b) will be contributed for a period not to exceed seven years.  This seven-year period will commence on January 1, 2016 (or on January 1 of the year in which the Participant attains age 55, or on the date of promotion to the E-Series Payroll, whichever is latest) and will be measured in the aggregate over a Participant s lifetime (i.e., regardless of whether the Participant has multiple periods of employment with the Company). 
              (iii) 
    Rules Applicable to Rehires 
     In the event that an eligible Participant described in subsection (A)(ii) (Hired Before 2009) subsequently terminates employment and is  hired  on or after January 1, 2016, as defined in the VIP for purposes of determining eligibility for Company Contributions thereunder, such Participant will become eligible thereafter for the DC SERP contribution described in subsection (A)(i), but only if the Participant otherwise satisfies the eligibility requirements for such benefit, and will no longer be eligible for the DC SERP contribution under subsection (A)(ii). 
           (B) 
    One-Time Contribution 
     An Employee who satisfies the requirements described in Section 5.1(A) (Hired On or After January 1, 2009), and who is first promoted to a level of E-1 through E-3 (from a position at the Company below a level of E-3) during the Plan Year, will receive a one-time additional contribution equal to the product of (i), (ii) and (iii) below. 
            (ii) 
    The sum of: 
              (a) 
    the Participant s Base Salary in effect immediately following the promotion, and 
              (b) 
    his or her Executive Incentive Pay target percentage multiplied by the Base Salary, both as in effect immediately following the promotion. 
     
   16 

(iii) 
    The Participant s whole years of Service as of the date of first promotion to a level of E-1 through E-3 (from a position at the Company below a level of E-3); provided that, for such purpose, a Participant s years of Service will be limited to Service earned since his or her most recent hire date. 
     This amount will be credited to the Participant s Account as of the date of first promotion to a level of E-1 through E-3, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible. 
  A Participant who has received a one-time contribution under this Section upon promotion to a level of E-1 through E-3 will be ineligible for any further contributions under this subsection (B). 
  A Participant described in Section 5.1(B) (Hired Before 2009) will not be eligible to receive a one-time DC SERP contribution under this subsection (B), unless and until reclassified upon rehire as described in Section 5.1(B). 
  5.4        DC SERP Vesting 
  No DC SERP Benefit shall be payable to a Participant or Beneficiary except to the extent such Participant is vested in the DC SERP Benefit. 
           (A) 
    General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired On or After January 1, 2009 
     A Participant described in Section 5.1(A) (Hired On or After January 1, 2009) will vest 100% in his or her DC SERP Benefit component(s) covered under this subsection (A) on the date the Participant satisfies the conditions in any of (i), (ii) or (iii) below. 
           (i) 
    The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 for a period of 36 consecutive months.  (For Participants with prior periods of employment, a period of consecutive months before January 1, 2009 on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 will be counted for purposes of determining whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has been satisfied.) 
              (ii) 
    The Participant dies while an Employee. 
              (iii) 
    The Participant is laid off from a position at level E-1 through E-3 and is eligible for benefits under The Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan. 
     See Section 5.4(C) below for additional vesting rules for these Participants based on age and Service. 
  
   17 

(B) 
    General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired Before January 1, 2009 
     A Participant described in Section 5.1(B) (Hired Before January 1, 2009) will vest 100% in his or her DC SERP Benefit component covered under this subsection (B) on the date the Participant satisfies the conditions in any of (i), (ii) or (iii) below. 
           (i) 
    The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months.  For a Participant on the E-Series Payroll as of January 1, 2016, a period of consecutive months before January 1, 2016 on the E-Series Payroll will be counted for purposes of determining whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has been satisfied. 
              (ii) 
    The Participant is fully vested under the PVP and/or BSS Plan, as applicable, and dies while an Employee before his or her DC SERP Benefit commences under this Plan. 
              (iii) 
    The Participant is laid off from an E-Series position and is eligible for benefits under The Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan. 
      Special vesting rules apply for a Participant described in Section 5.1(A) (Hired On or After 2009) who has attained either (i) or (ii) while employed by the Company. 
            (ii) 
    Age 62 with one year of Service. 
     This Participant will be 100% vested in the portion of his or her DC SERP Benefit described in Section 5.3(A) (Payroll Contributions) after he or she has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months. 
  This Participant will vest ratably in the portion of his or her DC SERP Benefit described in Section 5.3(B) (One-Time Contribution), if any, at the rate of 1/36 for each consecutive month that the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3, starting with the date on which the Participant was first promoted to the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3.  This pro rata vesting rule is not intended to preclude the acceleration of vesting under subsections (A)(ii) (death) or (iii) (layoff) above, if applicable. 
           (D) 
    Authorized Period of Absence 
     For purposes of this Section, an Authorized Period of Absence from the E-Series Payroll will count as a period on the E-Series Payroll, and an Authorized Period  
  
   18 

of Absence from a position at level E-1 through E-3 will count as a period at these levels. 
  If an Employee ceases to be at the applicable level for any reason other than an Authorized Period of Absence, and the Employee later returns to a position at the applicable level, these non-consecutive periods of service will not be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 36-consecutive month requirement has been met. 
           (E) 
    Transfers to and from ULA and USA 
     For purposes of computing vesting for a Participant who transfers employment directly from the Company to ULA or USA, uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive in a position at a comparable level will be credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described herein, provided that the Participant transfers directly from the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3 if applicable) at the Company to comparable executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable.  ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting under this Plan for any period following the Participant s removal from this executive status.  For purposes of computing vesting for a participant who transfers employment directly from ULA or USA to the Company, uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive at a position comparable to the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3, if applicable) will be credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described herein, provided that the Participant transfers directly from this executive status at ULA or USA to a position at a comparable level at the Company.  ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting under this Plan for any period prior to the Participant s attainment of this executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable. 
           (F) 
    Impact of Separation from Service/Transfer 
              (i) 
    Payroll Contributions  .  If a Participant Separates from Service (other than due to an Authorized Period of Absence) or transfers off of the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3, if applicable)   before   becoming 100% vested in the payroll contribution portion of his or her DC SERP Benefit described in Section 5.3(A)(i) and/or (A)(ii), as applicable, the Participant will forfeit all rights to the nonvested portion of his or her DC SERP Benefit attributable to the period prior to his or her Separation from Service or transfer.  To the extent any benefit under this Plan becomes vested during an Authorized Period of Absence that continues after a deemed Separation from Service, it will remain subject to the payment timing rules under Section 6.1. 
              (ii) 
    One-Time Contributions  .  If a Participant stops accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements (such as due to a Separation from Service) after becoming partially vested in the one-time  
     
   19 

contribution portion of the DC SERP Benefit, under subsection (C) above, and the Participant subsequently resumes accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements, the DC SERP Benefit accrued after such resumption will not be vested until the Participant satisfies the requirements of subsection (A) or (C) above following such resumption. 
           (iii) 
    Multiple DC SERP Benefits  .  Separate vesting requirements apply to each component of a Participant s DC SERP Benefit described in Sections 5.3(A)(i), (A)(ii), and (B).  This means that a Participant who has accrued more than one DC SERP Benefit component (such as, due to a Separation from Service and subsequent rehire) must satisfy the vesting requirements applicable to each such component.  If a Participant Separates from Service   after   becoming 100% vested in a particular DC SERP Benefit component, the Participant will be fully vested in any additional accruals under the   same   DC SERP Benefit component following rehire or return (even if the Participant fails to be at the applicable pay level for 36 consecutive months following rehire or return).  The Participant will not, however, be fully vested in any amounts accrued under a   different   DC SERP Benefit component described in Sections 5.3(A)(i), (A)(ii), and (B), unless and until the corresponding applicable vesting requirements under this Section 5.4 otherwise have been satisfied. 
     See Section 7.4 regarding missing participants and improper credits, Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment, and Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan. 
  5.5        DC SERP Forfeiture Rules 
  The Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that a Participant will forfeit any part or all of his or her DC SERP Benefit (whether or not vested) if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Company or within five (5) years after termination of such employment: 
           (A) 
    The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests.  For purposes of this Plan,  other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests  shall include any other unlawful act (i) committed against the Company, or the interests of the Company, including, but not limited to, a governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Company, or a customer of the Company, or (ii) affecting the Company or the interests of the Company, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Company or the interests of the Company, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
              (B) 
    The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or otherwise, which the Committee  
     
   20 

determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is  engaging in competition  with any significant aspect of Company business.  For purposes of this Plan,  engaging in competition  shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with any Company business or that takes a position adverse to any Company business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company, all as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
           (C) 
    The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (or equivalent but for title), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company s employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with the Company, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Participant or any third party. 
              (D) 
    The Participant disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Company, its products, or its employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings. 
              (E) 
    With respect to contributions made to the Plan on and after January 1, 2017, the Participant uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Company.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings. 
     To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of his or her DC SERP Benefit, the Committee will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover such DC SERP Benefit.  The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable, and as so amended shall continue in effect. 
  In addition, the Committee will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any DC SERP Benefit attributable to an incentive award that the Company seeks to recover under the clawback provision of any plan providing Executive Incentive Pay.

ARTICLE VI 
  Distributions 
  6.1        Form and Timing of Distribution 
           (A) 
    Restoration Benefit 
     A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her Restoration Benefit (including future Deferral Contributions, Company Matching Contributions, SBP+ Company Contributions, and Earnings Credits thereon) as described below, subject to the cashout rule in subsection (D) below.  This distribution election must be made at the same time the Participant makes his or her first Deferral Election (or first SBP+ Company Contribution Election, if earlier).  Any election made as to the form and timing of distribution will apply to the Participant s entire Restoration Benefit (including Deferral Contributions, Company Matching Contributions, any SBP+ Company Contributions, and Earnings Credits thereon).  If a Participant fails to make an election with regard to the   timing   of payment of the Restoration Benefit, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in January of the first Plan Year following the Participant s Separation from Service.  If a Participant fails to make an election with regard to the   form   of payment of the Restoration Benefit, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in a lump sum.  
  A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed election) with respect to his or her entire Restoration Benefit after the initial distribution election is made (or deemed made), to the extent permitted and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (E) below. 
           (B) 
    Executive SBP+ Company Contribution Benefit and DC SERP Benefit 
     No initial distribution elections are permitted or required with regard to a Participant s Executive SBP+ Company Contribution or DC SERP Benefit.  Rather, a Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive his or her Executive SBP+ Company Contribution and DC SERP Benefit in a lump sum, payable in January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service. 
  A Participant may change his or her deemed distribution election with respect to his or her combined DC SERP Benefit and Executive SBP+ Company Contributions (if any), to the extent permitted and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (E) below. 
           (C) 
    Timing and Form of Distribution 
              (i) 
    Lump Sum Distribution 
     
   22 

The lump sum distribution option is a single lump sum payment that will be made in the later of:  (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant s attainment of a specified age (subject to (F) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 6.1. The amount of such distribution will be based on the value of the Participant s Account determined as of the date of payment. 
           (ii) 
    Installment Payment 
     The installment payment option is a series of annual installment payments for a period between 2 and 15 years, as elected by the Participant under this Section 6.1.  The amount payable to the Participant each year generally shall be computed by multiplying the balance in the Account (or the applicable portion of the Account) as of the date payment is made by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years remaining in the distribution period on the first day of January of such year.  See Section 6.1(D) below for application of the cashout rule to installment payments. 
  Annual installment payments, if elected, will begin in the later of:  (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the Participant s attainment of a specified age (subject to (F) below), as elected by the Participant under this Section 6.1.  Payments will continue to be made each January thereafter until the full amount of the benefit has been paid. 
  The Plan will respect previous distribution elections made by certain Participants who are former participants in the Excess Benefit Plan for the BSS Retirement Plan, as amended ( BSS Excess Plan ).  For these Participants, any distribution election made prior to April 4, 2003 under section 3(b)(5) of the BSS Excess Plan will apply, unless the Participant elects otherwise under this Article VI. 
           (D) 
    Cashouts 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following rules shall apply, subject to the six-month delay in payment for Specified Employees under subsection (G): 
           (i) 
    If the balance in the Participant s Account is $10,000 or less in January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, the entire balance will be paid in the form of a single lump sum at that time. 
              (ii) 
    If a Participant has elected to receive installments and his or her remaining Account balance is $10,000 or less upon any scheduled payment date, the entire remaining balance will be paid in the form of a single lump sum at  
     
   23 

that time.  This paragraph (ii) will not apply to any Participant whose installment payments commenced prior to January 1, 2008. 
           (E) 
    Changes to Distribution Election or Deemed Election 
     A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed election) with regard to his or her entire Restoration Benefit only once after the initial distribution election is made (or deemed made).  A Participant also may change his or her deemed distribution election once with regard to his or her combined DC SERP Benefit and Executive SBP+ Company Contributions (if any).   
  Such election must change the time of payment (consistent with the requirement of clause (iii) below) and may change the form of payment (from lump sum to installments, or vice versa).   
  To the extent any such changes would defer commencement of any portion of the Participant s Account beyond both age 70  and Separation from Service, the changes will not be effective with respect to such portion. 
           (i) 
    A new distribution election must be submitted to the Committee at least 12 months before the existing scheduled distribution date, and during the annual election period established by the Committee. 
              (ii) 
    The revised distribution election must not take effect for at least 12 months after it is made. 
              (iii) 
    The new distribution election must provide for an additional deferral period of at least 5 years beyond the original distribution date. 
     In no event can installment payments be revoked once they have begun.  In all cases, payments will be made in January. 
           (F) 
    Distributions At Age 70  
     Payment of benefits under this Plan will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant both attains (or would have attained) age 70  and is Separated from Service.  Payment of benefits for Participants actively employed beyond age 70  will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service.  Subject to subsection (E), any election made by a Participant to the contrary will be deemed to be automatically revised to elect the distribution date described herein.  
  
   24 

(G) 
    Specified Employees 
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Article VI, a Specified Employee will not receive any distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service. 
  Subject to subsection (E) above, the Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected (or deemed elected) under subsection (A) or (B) above, as applicable.  This distribution will commence as of the later of: 
           (i) 
    the time elected (or deemed elected) under subsection (A) or (B), as applicable, 
              (ii) 
    the first day of the month following completion of the six-month waiting period (for Specified Employees who Separate from Service between July 1 and December 31), and 
              (iii) 
    January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service (for Specified Employees who Separate from Service between January 1 and June 30). 
     If a Participant has elected installments, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive year until the Account is exhausted. 
  In the event of a Specified Employee s death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to apply.  The Specified Employee s benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 6.2 (Death Benefits) below. 
           (H) 
    Distribution Due to Unforeseeable Emergency 
     A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Restoration Benefit and his or her Executive SBP+ Company Contribution benefit immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency.  A Participant or Beneficiary may not receive a distribution of his or her DC SERP Benefit solely in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, even if fully vested. 
  The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the Committee. 
  6.2        Death Benefits 
  If a Participant dies before his or her entire Restoration Benefit has been distributed, the remaining Restoration Benefit will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the Participant s election as to form and timing filed with the Committee with regard  
  
   25 

to the Restoration Benefit.  Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time and in the same form as the payment that otherwise would have been made to the Participant.  To the extent no distribution election has been filed with regard to the Restoration Benefit, the remaining Restoration Benefit will be paid to the Beneficiary in a single sum in January of the calendar year following the Participant s death. 
  If a Participant dies before his or her entire Executive SBP+ Company Contribution benefit and his or her entire DC SERP Benefit have been distributed, the remaining benefits will be paid to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with any change to the form and timing of payment elected by the Participant under Section 6.1(E) with regard to the Executive SBP+ Company Contribution and the DC SERP Benefit.  If no change has been elected, the remaining benefits will be distributed to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single sum in January of the calendar year following the Participant s death. 
  If a Beneficiary dies after the Participant, but before receiving the payment of all amounts due hereunder, then the unpaid amounts will be paid to the individual(s) designated (in accordance with the rules established by the Committee) by the Beneficiary as his or her beneficiary(ies), or if no such designation has been made (or if such individual(s) do(es) not survive to receive payment), then such unpaid amounts will be paid to the Beneficiary s estate, in a single lump sum, as soon as practicable after the Beneficiary s death.  
  6.3        Rehires and Authorized Periods of Absence/Reduced Level of Services 
  This Section 6.3 addresses the form and timing of payment for a Participant who is rehired by the Company following a Separation from Service, or who remains employed after a Separation from Service has occurred (for example, due to an extended Authorized Period of Absence or due to reduced level of services).   
  In the event that a Participant forfeits a nonvested DC SERP Benefit upon a Separation from Service, this benefit will not be restored upon rehire.  This rule applies regardless of whether the Participant satisfies the vesting criteria under Section 5.4 following rehire. 
           (A) 
    After Commencing Benefits 
     This subsection (A) applies to a Participant who has received or begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he or she has experienced a Separation from Service and has attained the specified age (if applicable). 
           (i) 
    Rehires  .  Installment payments that commenced prior to the Participant s rehire with respect to Deferral Contributions made and contributions received before the Participant s Separation from Service ( Old Benefits ) will not be suspended by reason of the Participant s rehire.  These Old Benefits will continue to be paid until exhausted, without regard to the period of rehire. 
     
   26 

Deferral Contributions made and contributions received attributable to periods after the date of rehire ( New Benefits ) will remain subject to the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(C) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(E)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire.  As a result, New Benefits (to the extent vested) will be distributed in January following the Participant s Separation from Service after rehire, in the form selected under the original distribution election or deemed election.  This is because the Participant already has attained the specified age under Section 6.1(C) but has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Benefits. 
           (ii) 
    Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services  .  To the extent a Participant made additional Deferral Contributions or received additional contributions while on an Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services that constituted a Separation from Service under Code section 409A, such Deferral Contributions made and contributions received (to the extent vested) will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they are made, in accordance with the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election.  This is because the Participant has already satisfied the conditions for payment under Section 6.1(C); namely, he or she has attained the specified age and has experienced a Separation from Service attributable to such Deferral Contributions made and contributions received. 
     The same rule will apply where the portion of a Participant s DC SERP Benefit attributable to one-time contributions vests ratably during an Authorized Period of Absence, under Sections 5.4(C) and (D).  Such newly vested benefits will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they vest, in accordance with the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election. 
           (B) 
    Before Commencing Benefits 
     This subsection (B) applies to a Participant who has not begun receiving benefits under the Plan. 
           (i) 
    Rehires  .  The rehired Participant s Old Benefits, to the extent vested, will be distributed in accordance with the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(C) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(E)).  This means that, for example, if the Participant s original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 6.1(C), then the  
     
   27 

Participant s Old Benefits, to the extent vested, will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if so elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age, even if the Participant has not had a subsequent Separation from Service after rehire.  This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age after the initial Separation from Service, but is rehired before benefits actually begin. 
  The Participant s New Benefits will remain subject to the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(C) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(E)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire, as described in Section 6.3(A) above.  As a result, New Benefits (to the extent vested) will be distributed either (i) in January following the Participant s Separation from Service   after rehire  , or (ii) in January following both the Participant s Separation from Service   after rehire   and after attainment of the specified age, in accordance with the original distribution election or deemed election.  This is because the Participant has not yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Benefits. 
           (ii) 
    Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services  .  Any Deferral Contributions made or contributions received during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services (to the extent vested), and any DC SERP one-time contributions that vest during such period, will be distributed in accordance with the Participant s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(C) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(E)).  This means that, for example, if the Participant s original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 6.1(C), then any Deferral Contributions made and contributions received during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services (to the extent vested), and any DC SERP one-time contributions vested during such period, will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if so elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age.  This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age while on an Authorized Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services, but resumes (or increases his or her level of) services before benefits actually begin. 
     
   28 

ARTICLE VII 
  Accounts 
  7.1        Participant Accounts 
  The Committee will establish and maintain an Account for each Participant, for each period of employment.  Solely for this purpose, a period of employment will be treated as commencing upon a Participant s eligibility for the Plan (following hire or rehire as applicable) and ending with his or her Separation from Service. 
  Each Account will be credited with Deferral Contributions, Company Matching Contributions, SBP+ Company Contributions, Executive SBP+ Company Contributions, and DC SERP Benefits, as applicable for the relevant period of employment, as well as Earnings Credits described in Section 7.2 below.  Each Account will be reduced as payments are made. 
  For Heritage BSS Participants, the Accounts shall also include any account as of April 3, 2003 under the BSS Excess Plan, as adjusted after April 3, 2003 for earnings, losses and expenses.  As of April 4, 2003, all accounts of Heritage BSS Participants under the BSS Excess Plan were transferred to this Plan.  For purposes of this Section,  Heritage BSS Participant  means any Participant in this Plan having a prior benefit under the BSS Excess Plan based on his or her participation in the BSS Voluntary Savings Plan. 
  7.2        Earnings Credits 
  A Participant s Account(s) will be credited, at the Participant s election, with earnings under one or more of the following, as the Participant elects and subject to any rules or limitations as may be imposed by the Committee:  (i) the Interest Fund method, (ii) the Boeing Stock Fund method, or (iii) the Other Investment Funds method, each as described below.  In the absence of an election the Interest Fund method will be used.  A Participant may elect a different earnings method as to each Account.     
           (A) 
    Interest Fund Method 
     Under this method, a Participant s Interest Fund method sub-account shall be adjusted daily in accordance with changes in the unit value of the sub-account to reflect interest, based on the Participant s sub-account balance. 
  Interest will be calculated for each Plan Year as the mean between the high and low (during the first eleven months of the preceding Plan Year) of yields on AA-rated industrial bonds as reported by Moody s Investors Service, Inc., rounded to the nearest  th of one percent.  The Company will notify Participants annually of the established interest rate. 
  
   29 

(B) 
    Boeing Stock Fund Method 
     Under this method, a Participant s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account shall be credited with the number of shares of the Company s common stock that could be purchased with the amount credited to such sub-account, based on the Fair Market Value of the Company s common stock on the day the sub-account is so credited (or on the next business day on which the New York Stock Exchange (the  Exchange ) is open, if the Exchange is closed on the day the sub-account is credited) excluding commissions, taxes, and other charges.  Such number shall be recorded as stock units in the Participant s sub-account, for bookkeeping purposes only.  For purposes of the Plan,  Fair Market Value  means the mean of the high and low per share trading prices for the common stock of the Company as reported for the  New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions  for a single trading day.  The number of stock units in a sub-account shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and other like adjustments in the Company s common stock. 
  Each Participant s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account periodically shall be credited with the number of shares of the Company s common stock that could be purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, with an amount equal to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number of shares of the Company s common stock that equals the number of stock units in a Participant s sub-account.  The Company will notify Participants annually of the number of stock units, and the dividend equivalents, credited to their sub-account. 
           (C) 
    Other Investment Funds Method 
     Under this method, a Participant may choose to diversify his or her Other Investment Funds sub-account by electing that it be credited (or charged) with the expenses, income, gains and losses on investment funds similar to those offered under the VIP (excluding the Boeing Stock Fund and Stable Value Fund offered thereunder) as designated by the Committee from time to time, pursuant to an election by the Participant to have the Participant s sub-account credited as though the Participant had elected to invest in such funds in such increments as the Participant will direct in accordance with rules established by the Committee or its delegates; provided that the Committee may disregard such elections in its discretion. 
  7.3        Investment Election Changes and Restrictions 
  A Participant may change how future additions to his or her Accounts are deemed invested anytime during the Plan Year.  The Participant may also transfer any portion of his or her sub-accounts from one fund method to another on a daily basis, provided that a Participant may not transfer funds from one method (or investment fund under such method) to another and back on the same day. 
  
   30 

In addition, transfers cannot be made into the Boeing Stock Fund method for 30 calendar days after transferring funds out of the Boeing Stock Fund method.  This restriction applies regardless of the number of units or the dollar value of the transfer.  However, the Participant may continue to direct future additions into the Boeing Stock Fund method and make transfers out of this fund method at any time, subject to insider trading rules. 
  7.4        Missing Participants and Improper Credits 
  A Participant s Account may be forfeited or reduced upon the occurrence of one of the following events, even if 100% vested: 
           (A) 
    The Committee is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to distribute amounts from his or her Account (a  missing participant ). 
              (B) 
    The Committee recaptures amounts improperly credited to a Participant s Account. 
     See also Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment and Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan. 

31 

ARTICLE VIII 
  Administration 
  8.1        Plan Administration 
  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall make such rules, interpretations, determinations of fact and computations as it may deem appropriate.  Any decision of the Committee with respect to the Plan, including (without limitation) any determination of eligibility to participate in the Plan and any calculation of Plan benefits, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.  The Committee shall submit to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors periodic reports covering the operation of the Plan. 
  8.2        Claims Procedure 
  The procedures for making claims for benefits under the Plan and for having the denial of a benefits claim reviewed shall be the same as those procedures set forth in the VIP. 
  See Section 10.8 regarding limitations on subsequent legal action.   
  
   32 

ARTICLE IX 
  Amendment and Termination 
  The Board of Directors shall have the authority to amend or terminate the Plan at any time.  The Board of Directors may delegate its authority to amend the Plan at any time, in its sole discretion.  In the event of Plan amendment or termination, a Participant s benefits under the Plan shall not be less than the Plan benefits to which the Participant would be entitled if the Participant had terminated employment immediately prior to such amendment or termination of the Plan. 
  In general, upon the termination of the Plan with respect to any Participant, the affected Participants will not be entitled to receive a distribution until the time specified in Article VI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Boeing Company may, in its discretion, terminate the entire Plan and pay each Participant a single lump-sum distribution of his or her entire accrued benefit to the extent permitted under conditions set forth in Code section 409A and any IRS or Treasury guidance thereunder. 

33 

ARTICLE X    
  Miscellaneous 
  10.1        No Employment Rights 
  Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any person any right to remain in the employ of the Company or affect any right of the Company to terminate a person s employment with or without cause. 
  10.2        Anti-Assignment 
  No benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal process.  Any attempt to take such action shall be void and shall authorize the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, to forfeit all further right and interest in any benefit under this Plan.  In addition, a Participant s Account may be reduced by the amount of any tax obligation paid by the Company on behalf of a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, if such individual fails to reimburse the Company for such obligation. 
  10.3        Unfunded Status of Plan 
  No funds shall be segregated or earmarked for any current or former Participant, Beneficiary or other person under the Plan.  However, the Company may establish one or more trusts to assist in meeting its obligations under the Plan, the assets of which shall be subject to the claims of the Company s general creditors.  No current or former Participant, Beneficiary or other person, individually or as a member of a group, shall have any right, title or interest in any account, fund, grantor trust, or any asset that may be acquired by the Company in respect of its obligations under the Plan (other than as a general creditor of the Company with an unsecured claim against its general assets). 
  10.4        Delays in Payment 
  Payment of benefits under this Plan may be delayed to the extent permitted by Code section 409A, as determined by the Committee. 
  10.5        Involuntary Inclusion in Income 
  If a determination is made that the Account of any Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is subject to current income taxation under Code section 409A, then the taxable portion of such Account will be immediately distributed to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary), notwithstanding the general timing rules described in Article V above. 
  
   34 

10.6        Compliance with Code Section 409A 
  It is intended that amounts deferred under this Plan will not be taxable under section 409A of the Code with respect to any individual.  All provisions of this Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with this intent. 
  10.7        Construction 
  The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions will be determined under and will be construed according to federal law and, to the extent permissible, according to the internal laws of the state of Illinois.  If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid for any reason, such determination will not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included. 
  10.8        Legal Action 
  No legal action may be brought in court on a claim for benefits under the Plan after 180 days following the decision on appeal (or 180 days following the expiration of the time to make an appeal if no appeal is made). 
   The Company has the right to deduct any federal, state, local or foreign taxes that are required to be withheld from any payments made hereunder.

ARTICLE 4 
  LAYOFF BENEFIT 
    
           4.1 
    Layoff Benefit  .  The Layoff Benefit for an Employee who incurs a Layoff Event on or after January 1, 2010 is equal to: 
       
           a) 
    One year of Base Salary (as in effect immediately prior to the Layoff Event), plus 
       
           b) 
    The Employee's annual target incentive under the Incentive Plan multiplied by the Company performance score applicable to the Employee under the Incentive Plan for the year during which the Layoff Event occurs, limited to the actual payout under the Incentive Plan, if any, for such year for an active Employee with the same target incentive (and an individual performance score of 1.0) and determined as though the Employee were employed by the same business unit throughout such year as he or she is employed by on the date of the Layoff Event, less 
       
           c) 
    If applicable, the total of all payments made, or to be made, pursuant to any individual employment, separation or severance agreement. 
       
  Incentive pay will not include any portion of an incentive award that the Company seeks to recover under the clawback provision of the Incentive Plan.  
    
           4.2 
    Timing of Payment  .  An Employee will receive the portion of the Layoff Benefit described in Section 4.1(a) (as adjusted by Section 4.1(c)) in a lump sum within a reasonable period of time following the Layoff Event, but in no event later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which occurs the Layoff Event.  An Employee will receive the portion, if any, of the Layoff Benefit described in Section 4.1(b) (as adjusted by Section 4.1(c)) in a lump sum in the year following the year of the Layoff Event, but in no event later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the year following the year in which occurs the Layoff Event. 
       
  It is intended all amounts payable under this Plan shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Code Section 409A, and all terms and provisions shall be interpreted to satisfy such requirements.  Specifically, it is intended that an amount payable under this Plan qualify as a short-term deferral (as described in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4)) and, to the extent not a short-term deferral, as a separation payment due to an involuntary separation from service (as described in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)).  However, in the unlikely event that a portion of a Layoff Benefit payable to a Specified Employee is not exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A (a  Non-Exempt Amount ), such Non-Exempt Amount will be paid to the Specified Employee as soon as practicable on or after the later of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the Specified Employee s Layoff Event, or (ii) the time specified in the paragraph above. 
    
  All payments under this Plan shall be net of any and all applicable withholding taxes, and interest shall not accrue on any portion of the Layoff Benefit, regardless of the time of payment.

           4.5 
    Recovery of Debt  .  If an Employee owes the Company an acknowledged debt, including, but not limited to, loans, relocation fees, and travel advances, such debt may be deducted from the Layoff Benefit, subject to applicable state laws. 
       
           4.6 
    Waiver of Claims  .  As a condition to receiving the Layoff Benefit described in Section 4.2, the Employee must execute a release of all claims by submitting to the Company a Waiver and Release form in a form provided by the Company. 
       
           4.7 
    Death Benefit  .  No Layoff Benefits are due under the Plan with respect to an Employee to the extent not received by the Employee prior to his or her death. 
       
           4.8 
    Forfeiture  . Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that an Employee will forfeit any part or all of his or her Layoff Benefit if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Company or within five (5) years after termination of such employment: 
       
           1. 
    The Employee is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests. For purposes of this Plan,  other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests  shall include any other unlawful act (i) committed against the Company, or the interests of the Company, including, but not limited to, a governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Company, or a customer of the Company, or (ii) affecting the Company or the interests of the Company, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Company or the interests of the Company, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
       
           2. 
    The Employee, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or otherwise, which the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Employee is  engaging in competition  with any significant aspect of Company business. For purposes of this Plan,  engaging in competition  shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition with any Company business or that takes a position adverse to any Company business, regardless of the position or duties the Employee takes, in such a manner that is  
     
   5 

determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company, all as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
    
           3. 
    The Employee, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company s Senior Vice President of Human Resources (or equivalent but for title), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company s employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with the Company, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Employee or any third party. 
       
           4. 
    The Employee disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Company, its products, or its employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.  
       
           5. 
    The Employee uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Company.  Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings. 
       
  To the extent the Employee has already commenced payment of his or her Layoff Benefit, the Committee will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the Employee to enforce the forfeiture of and recover such Layoff Benefit. The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable, and as so amended shall continue in effect.  
    
  In addition, the Committee will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any Layoff Benefit attributable to an incentive award that the Company seeks to recover under the clawback provision of the Incentive Plan.

At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of a SAR may be in cash, in shares of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
  8.3  Post-Termination Exercise 
  The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences a freestanding SAR whether the SAR shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time, provided that any such waiver or modification shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A.

No such interest shall be subject to execution, attachment or similar legal process, including, without limitation, seizure for the payment of the Participant s debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance. Except as provided in this Section 14, during the lifetime of a Participant, Awards are exercisable only by the Participant or his or her legal representative in the case of physical or mental incapacitation of the Participant as evidenced by legal order. 
  Section 15.  Adjustments 
  15.1  No Corporate Action Restriction 
  The existence of the Plan, any Award agreement and/or the Awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Board or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize (a) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company s or any subsidiary s capital structure or its business, (b) any merger, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Company or any subsidiary, (c) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stocks ahead of or affecting the Company s or any subsidiary s capital stock or the rights thereof, (d) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any subsidiary, (e) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the Company s or any subsidiary s assets or business, or (f) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any subsidiary. No Participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim against any member of the Board or the Committee, the Company or any subsidiary, or any employees, officers, shareholders or agents of the Company or any subsidiary, as a result of any such action. 
  15.2  Recapitalization Adjustments 
  In the event of a dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other property) other than regular cash dividends, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, change in control or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other corporate transaction or event affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is necessary or appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, the Board shall equitably adjust (a) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted, (b) the maximum share limitation applicable to each type of Award that may be granted to any individual Participant in any calendar year, (c) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (d) the exercise price with respect to any Option or the grant price with respect to any Stock Appreciation Right. 
  15.3  Corporate Transactions 
  If the Company enters into or is involved in any Corporate Transaction, the Board may, prior to such Corporate Transaction and effective upon such Corporate Transaction, take such action as it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, replacing outstanding Awards with Substitute Awards in respect of the shares, other securities or other property of the surviving corporation or any affiliate of the surviving corporation on such terms and conditions, as to the number of shares, pricing and otherwise, which shall substantially preserve the value, rights and benefits of any affected Awards granted hereunder as of the date of the consummation of the Corporate Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if any Corporate Transaction occurs, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cancel each Participant s Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights and to pay to each affected Participant in connection with the cancellation of such Participant s Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Corporate Transaction Price (as defined below), as determined by the Board, of the Common Stock underlying any unexercised Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (whether then exercisable or not) over the aggregate exercise price of such unexercised Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights, and make additional adjustments and/or settlements of other outstanding Awards as it determines to be fair and equitable to affected Participants.  Upon receipt by any affected Participant of any such Substitute Award (or payment) as a result of any such Corporate Transaction, such Participant s affected Awards for which such Substitute Awards (or payment) were received shall be thereupon cancelled without the need for obtaining the consent of any such affected Participant. 
  Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Board shall not take any further action that causes any Awards, which are not then exercisable and vested, to automatically become vested and exercisable in connection with a Corporate Transaction under this Section 15.3. 
  For purposes of the Plan,  
  (a)   Corporate Transaction  means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any  person  (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the  beneficial owner  (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company s then-outstanding voting securities; (ii) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; (iii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding  

or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (iv) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the  Incumbent Board ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.   
  (b)   Corporate Transaction Price  means the highest price per share of Common Stock paid in any transaction related to a Corporate Transaction. To the extent that the consideration paid in any Corporate Transaction consists all or in part of securities or other non-cash consideration, the value of such securities or other non-cash consideration shall be determined in the good-faith discretion of the Board consistent with provisions of Section 409A and/or other applicable law. 
  Section 16.  Amendment and Termination 
  16.1  Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan 
  The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an amendment that constitutes a  material revision,  as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange shall be submitted to the Company s shareholders for approval. In addition, any revision that deletes or limits the scope of the provisions in Sections 7.2 and 8.4 prohibiting repricing of Options or SARs without shareholder approval and any revision that increases the number of shares stated in Section 4.1 as available for issuance under the Plan shall be considered material revisions that require shareholder approval. 
  16.2  Term of the Plan 
  Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Shareholder Approval Effective Date. After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the Plan s terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption in February 2014 of this amended and restated Plan by the Board. 
  16.3  Consent of Participant 
  The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participant s consent, materially adversely affect any rights under any Award theretofore granted to the Participant under the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a  modification  that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 15 shall not be subject to these restrictions. 
  Section 17.  General 
  17.1  Clawbacks  
  Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the Clawback Policy as adopted by the Board and as amended from time to time.  In addition, subject to applicable local law, Awards granted under the Plan on or after February 1, 2017 shall be subject to clawback and forfeiture in the event a Participant or former Participant engages in any of the following conduct, as determined by the Company or its delegate in its sole discretion,  prior to the second anniversary of the later of the vesting or receipt of payment of the Award: the Participant (i) is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company s interests; (ii) directly or indirectly engages in competition with any significant aspect of Company business;  (iii) induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company s employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with the Company, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Participant or any third party; (iv) disparages the Company or its products or employees; or (v) uses or discloses Company proprietary or confidential information.  Nothing in this Section 17.1 will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial or arbitral proceedings.   
  17.2  No Individual Rights 
  No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan. 
  Furthermore, nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant s employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause. 
  17.3  Issuance of Shares 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company s counsel, such issuance,  

delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. 
  The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made. The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal, state and foreign securities laws. The Company may also require such other action or agreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws. 
  To the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. 
  17.4  Indemnification 
  Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 3 shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company s approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend such claim, action, suit or proceeding before he or she undertakes to handle and defend the same on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. 
  The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
  17.5  No Rights as a Shareholder 
  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award. 
  17.6  Compliance With Laws and Regulations 
  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants. With respect to officers and directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  
  Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an  incentive stock option  within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision. 
  Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, it is the Company s intention that any and all Awards and compensation payable under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under Section 409A and that all terms and provisions shall be interpreted to satisfy such requirements.  If the Committee determines that an Award, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Participant to become subject to Section 409A, the Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right , but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A.  Awards not deferred under Section 6.3 and not otherwise exempt from the requirements of Section 409A are intended to qualify for the short-term deferral exemption to Section 409A, and payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Award became vested, but in no event shall such payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Award became vested unless otherwise permitted under the exemption provisions of Section 409A.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Award made under the Plan that is determined to be  deferred compensation  (within the meaning of Section 409A), (a) references to Termination of Service will mean the Participant s  separation from service  (within the meaning of Section 409A) with the Company or any applicable Related Company, and (b) any payment to be made with respect to such Award in connection with the Participant s Termination of Service that would be subject to the limitations in Section 409A(a)(2)(b) of the Code shall be delayed until six months after the Participant s separation from service (or earlier death) in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.   
  17.7  Participants in Other Countries 
  The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 8.1, where applicable foreign law requires that compensatory stock right be priced based upon a specific price averaging method and period, a stock right granted in accordance with such applicable foreign law will be treated as meeting the requirements of Sections 7.2 or 8.1, provided that the averaging period does not exceed 30 days. 
  17.8  No Trust or Fund 
  The Plan is intended to constitute an  unfunded  plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. 
  17.9  Successors 
  All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company. 
  17.10  Severability 
  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee s determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
  17.11  Choice of Law 
  The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws thereof. 
  Section 18.  Restatement Effective Date 
  This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall be effective October 31, 2016.
