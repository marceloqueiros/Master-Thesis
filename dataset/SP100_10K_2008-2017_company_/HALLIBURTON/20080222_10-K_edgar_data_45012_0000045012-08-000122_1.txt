      General
description of business 

      Halliburton
Company s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware in 1924.  Halliburton Company provides a variety
of services and products to customers in the energy industry. 

      In
November 2006, KBR, Inc. (KBR), which at the time was our wholly owned
subsidiary, completed an initial public offering (IPO), in which it sold
approximately 32 million shares of KBR common stock at $17.00 per
share.  Proceeds from the IPO were approximately $508 million, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  On
April 5, 2007, we completed the separation of KBR from us by exchanging the
135.6 million shares of KBR common stock owned by us on that date for 85.3
million shares of our common stock.  In the second quarter of 2007, we
recorded a gain on the disposition of KBR of approximately $933 million, net of
tax and the estimated fair value of the indemnities and guarantees provided to
KBR, which is included in income from discontinued operations in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

      Subsequent
to the KBR separation, in the third quarter of 2007, we realigned our products
and services to improve operational and cost management efficiencies, better
serve our customers, and become better aligned with the process of exploring for
and producing from oil and natural gas wells.  We now operate under
two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we now
report:  the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and
Evaluation segment.  The two KBR segments have been reclassified as
discontinued operations. 

      See Note
4 to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about our
business segments. 

      Description
of services and products 

      We offer
a broad suite of services and products to customers through our two business
segments for the exploration, development, and production of oil and
gas.  We serve major, national, and independent oil and gas companies
throughout the world.  The following summarizes our services and
products for each business segment. 

      Completion
and Production 

      Our
Completion and Production segment delivers cementing, stimulation, intervention,
and completion services.  This segment consists of production
enhancement services, completion tools and services, and cementing
services. 

      Production
enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
sand control services, and well intervention services.  Stimulation
services optimize oil and gas reservoir production through a variety of pressure
pumping services, nitrogen services, and chemical processes, commonly known as
hydraulic fracturing and acidizing.  Pipeline process services include
pipeline and facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping,
chemical systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the
midstream and downstream sectors of the energy business.  Sand control
services include fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the
prevention of formation sand production.  Well intervention services
enable live well intervention and continuous pipe deployment capabilities
through the use of hydraulic workover systems and coiled tubing tools and
services. 

      Completion
tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
completion systems, expandable liner hanger systems, sand control systems, well
servicing tools, and reservoir performance services.  Reservoir
performance services include testing tools, real-time reservoir analysis, and
data acquisition services.  Additionally, completion tools and
services include WellDynamics, an intelligent well completions joint venture,
which we consolidate for accounting purposes. 

      Cementing
services involve bonding the well and well casing while isolating fluid zones
and maximizing wellbore stability.  Our cementing service line also
provides casing equipment. 

      Drilling
and Evaluation 

      Our
Drilling and Evaluation segment provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling,
evaluation, and precise well-bore placement solutions that enable customers to
model, measure, and optimize their well construction activities.  This
segment consists of Baroid Fluid Services, Sperry Drilling Services, Security
DBS Drill Bits, wireline and perforating services, Landmark, and project
management. 

1 

Baroid
Fluid Services provides drilling fluid systems, performance additives,
completion fluids, solids control, specialized testing equipment, and waste
management services for oil and gas drilling, completion, and workover
operations. 

      Sperry
Drilling Services provides drilling systems and services.  These
services include directional and horizontal drilling,
measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface data logging,
multilateral systems, underbalanced applications, and rig site information
systems.  Our drilling systems offer directional control while
providing important measurements about the characteristics of the drill string
and geological formations while drilling directional wells.  Real-time
operating capabilities enable the monitoring of well progress and aid
decision-making processes. 

      Security
DBS Drill Bits provides roller cone rock bits, fixed cutter bits, hole
enlargement and related downhole tools and services used in drilling oil and gas
wells.  In addition, coring equipment and services are provided to
acquire cores of the formation drilled for evaluation. 

      Wireline
and perforating services include open-hole wireline services that provide
information on formation evaluation, including resistivity, porosity, and
density, rock mechanics, and fluid sampling.  Also offered are
cased-hole and slickline services, which provide cement bond evaluation,
reservoir monitoring, pipe evaluation, pipe recovery, mechanical services, well
intervention, and perforating.  Perforating services include
tubing-conveyed perforating services and products. 

      Landmark
is a supplier of integrated exploration, drilling, and production software
information systems, as well as consulting and data management services for the
upstream oil and gas industry. 

      The
Drilling and Evaluation segment also provides oilfield project management and
integrated solutions to independent, integrated, and national oil
companies.  These offerings make use of all of our oilfield services,
products, technologies, and project management capabilities to assist our
customers in optimizing the value of their oil and gas assets. 

      Acquisitions
and dispositions 

      In July
2007, we acquired the entire share capital of PSL Energy Services Limited
(PSLES), an eastern hemisphere provider of process, pipeline, and well
intervention services.  PSLES has operational bases in the United
Kingdom, Norway, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Algeria, and Asia
Pacific.  We paid approximately $330 million for PSLES, consisting of
$326 million in cash and $4 million in debt assumed, subject to adjustment for
working capital purposes.  As of December 31, 2007, we had recorded
goodwill of $163 million and intangible assets of $54 million on a preliminary
basis until our analysis of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is complete.  Beginning in August 2007, PSLES s results of
operations are included in our Completion and Production segment. 

      As a part
of our sale of Dresser Equipment Group in 2001, we retained a small equity
interest in Dresser Inc. s Class A common stock.  Dresser Inc. was
later reorganized as Dresser, Ltd., and we exchanged our shares for shares of
Dresser, Ltd.  In May 2007, we sold our remaining interest in Dresser,
Ltd.  We received $70 million in cash from the sale and recorded a $49
million gain.  This investment was reflected in  Other assets  on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. 

      In
January 2007, we acquired all intellectual property, current assets, and
existing business associated with Calgary-based Ultraline Services Corporation
(Ultraline), a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp.  Ultraline is
a provider of wireline services in Canada.  We paid approximately $178
million for Ultraline and recorded goodwill of $124 million and intangible
assets of $41 million.  Beginning in February 2007, Ultraline s
results of operations are included in our Drilling and Evaluation
segment. 

      In
January 2005, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in Subsea 7, Inc. to our
joint venture partner, Siem Offshore (formerly DSND Subsea ASA), for
approximately $200 million in cash.  As a result of the transaction,
we recorded a gain of approximately $110 million during the first quarter of
2005.  We accounted for our 50% ownership of Subsea 7, Inc. using the
equity method in our Completion and Production segment. 

      Business
strategy 

      Our
business strategy is to secure a distinct and sustainable competitive position
as a pure-play oilfield service company by delivering products and services to
our customers that maximize their production and recovery and realize proven
reserves from difficult environments.  Our objectives are
to: 

2 

- 

create
      a balanced portfolio of products and services supported by global
      infrastructure and anchored by technology innovation with a
      well-integrated digital strategy to further differentiate our
      company; 

- 

reach
      a distinguished level of operational excellence that reduces costs and
      creates real value from everything we
do; 

- 

preserve
      a dynamic workforce by being a preferred employer to attract, develop, and
      retain the best global talent; and 

- 

uphold
      the ethical and business standards of the company and maintain the highest
      standards of health, safety, and environmental
  performance. 

Markets
and competition 

      We are
one of the world s largest diversified energy services companies.  Our
services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the
world.  Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and
products include: 

- 

price; 

- 

service
      delivery (including the ability to deliver services and products on an  as
      needed, where needed  basis); 

- 

health,
      safety, and environmental standards and
  practices; 

- 

service
      quality; 

- 

global
      talent retention; 

- 

knowledge
      of the reservoir; 

- 

product
      quality; 

- 

warranty;
      and 

- 

technical
      proficiency. 

We
conduct business worldwide in approximately 70 countries.  In 2007,
based on the location of services provided and products sold, 44% of our
consolidated revenue was from the United States.  In 2006, 45% of our
consolidated revenue was from the United States.  In 2005, 43% of our
consolidated revenue was from the United States.  No other country
accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during these
periods.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional financial information about geographic operations in the last three
years.  Because the markets for our services and products are vast and
cross numerous geographic lines, a meaningful estimate of the total number of
competitors cannot be made.  The industries we serve are highly
competitive, and we have many substantial competitors.  Largely all of
our services and products are marketed through our servicing and sales
organizations. 

      Operations
in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
acts of terrorism, civil unrest, expropriation or other governmental actions,
exchange control problems, and highly inflationary currencies.  We
believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the
risk that loss of operations in any one country would be material to the conduct
of our operations taken as a whole. 

      Information
regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration, and
financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
Financial Instrument Market Risk and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements. 

      Customers 

      Our
revenue from continuing operations during the past three years was derived from
the sale of services and products to the energy industry.  No customer
represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period
presented. 

      Raw
materials 

      Raw
materials essential to our business are normally readily
available.  Current market conditions have triggered constraints in
the supply of certain raw materials, such as sand, cement, and specialty
metals.  Given high activity levels, particularly in the United
States, we are seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as
manage the rising costs of raw materials.  Our procurement department
is using our size and buying power through several programs designed to ensure
that we have access to key materials at competitive prices. 

3 

Research
and development costs 

      We
maintain an active research and development program.  The program
improves existing products and processes, develops new products and processes,
and improves engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs
of our customers.  Our expenditures for research and development
activities were $301 million in 2007, $254 million in 2006, and $218 million in
2005, of which over 97% was company-sponsored in each year. 

      Patents 

      We own a
large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent
applications covering various products and processes.  We are also
licensed to utilize patents owned by others.  We do not consider any
particular patent to be material to our business operations. 

      Seasonality 

      On an
overall basis, our operations are not generally affected by
seasonality.  Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the
performance of our services, but the widespread geographical locations of our
operations serve to mitigate those effects.  Examples of how weather
can impact our business include: 

- 

the
      severity and duration of the winter in North America can have a
      significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for natural
      gas; 

- 

the
      timing and duration of the spring thaw in Canada directly affects activity
      levels due to road restrictions; 

- 

typhoons
      and hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations;
      and 

- 

severe
      weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity
      levels in the North Sea and Russia. 

In
addition, due to higher spending near the end of the year by customers for
software and completion tools and services, Landmark and completion tools
results of operations are generally stronger in the fourth quarter of the year
than at the beginning of the year. 

      Employees 

      At
December 31, 2007, we employed approximately 51,000 people worldwide compared to
approximately 45,000 at December 31, 2006.  At December 31, 2007,
approximately 12% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining
agreements.  Based upon the geographic diversification of these
employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective
actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a
whole. 

      Environmental
regulation 

      We are
subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related to
our operations worldwide.  In the United States, these laws and
regulations include, among others: 

- 

the
      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
      Act; 

- 

the
      Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act; 

- 

the
      Clean Air Act; 

- 

the
      Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
and 

- 

the
      Toxic Substances Control Act. 

In
addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
requirements by which we must abide.  We evaluate and address the
environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated
properties in order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental,
legal, and regulatory requirements.  On occasion, we are involved in
specific environmental litigation and claims, including the remediation of
properties we own or have operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct
compliance-related matters.  Our Health, Safety and Environment group
has several programs in place to maintain environmental leadership and to
prevent the occurrence of environmental contamination. 

      We do not
expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
operations.

5.  Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

        Halliburton
Company s common stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.  Information related to the high and low market prices of
common stock and quarterly dividend payments is included under the caption
 Quarterly Data and Market Price Information  on page 87 of this annual
report.  Cash dividends on common stock in the amount of $0.09 per
share were paid in June, September, and December of 2007 and $0.075 per share
were paid in March of 2007 and March, June, September, and December of
2006.  Our Board of Directors intends to consider the payment of
quarterly dividends on the outstanding shares of our common stock in the
future.  The declaration and payment of future dividends, however,
will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among
other things, future earnings, general financial condition and liquidity,
success in business activities, capital requirements, and general business
conditions. 

        The
following graph and table compare total shareholder return on our common stock
for the five-year period ending December 31, 2007, with the Standard  
Poor s 500 Stock Index and the Standard   Poor s Energy Composite Index over
the same period.  This comparison assumes the investment of $100 on
December 31, 2002, and the reinvestment of all dividends.  The
shareholder return set forth is not necessarily indicative of future
performance. 

At February
18, 2008, there were 19,110 shareholders of record.  In calculating
the number of shareholders, we consider clearing agencies and security position
listings as one shareholder for each agency or
listing.

Following
is a summary of repurchases of our common stock during the three-month period

(a) 

Of
      the 1,947,751 shares purchased during the three-month period ended
      December 31, 2007, 96,476 shares were acquired from employees in
      connection with the settlement of income tax and related benefit
      withholding obligations arising from vesting in restricted stock
      grants.  These shares were not part of a publicly announced
      program to purchase common shares. 

(b) 

In
      July 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase to our
      existing common share repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion, bringing
      the entire authorization to $5.0 billion.  This additional
      authorization may be used for open market share purchases or to settle the
      conversion premium on our 3.125% convertible senior notes, should they be
      redeemed.  From the inception of this program through December
      31, 2007, we have repurchased approximately 79 million shares of our
      common stock for approximately $2.7 billion at an average price per share
      of $33.91.  These numbers include the repurchases of
      approximately 39 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.4
      billion at an average price per share of $34.93 during 2007.  As
      of December 31, 2007, $2.3 billion remained available under our share

HALLIBURTON
COMPANY 

      Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations 

EXECUTIVE
OVERVIEW 

During
2007, our continuing operations produced revenue of $15.3 billion and operating
income of $3.5 billion, reflecting an operating margin of
23%.  Revenue increased $2.3 billion or 18% over 2006, while operating
income improved $253 million or 8% over 2006.  Internationally, our
operations experienced 21% revenue growth and 18% operating income growth in
2007 compared to 2006.  Consistent with our initiative to grow our
eastern hemisphere operations, revenue from the eastern hemisphere increased 27%
to $6.3 billion in 2007 compared to 2006, comprising nearly 90% of the revenue
growth derived internationally.  Moreover, eastern hemisphere
quarterly operating margins consistently remained above 20%. 

      Business
outlook 

      The
outlook for our business remains generally favorable.  Despite
challenging market conditions in North America, the region realized strong
revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006.  However, downward pressure
on pricing in the latter half of 2007, particularly in our United States well
stimulation land operations, negatively impacted our operating
results.  Based on price levels that were negotiated on contracts that
renewed in the fourth quarter of 2007, we anticipate an average price decline
for our United States land stimulation work in the mid- to upper-single digits
in the first quarter of 2008 relative to the fourth quarter of
2007.  We believe pricing pressure may be partially mitigated by
higher levels of asset utilization for our fracturing equipment and our
horizontal drilling technologies, as we continue to see increasing demand from
our customers due to trends toward production from unconventional reservoirs
that were previously not economical.  We believe that these factors
may contribute to volume increases in the technologically driven segments of the
energy services business, even if rig counts remain relatively
flat.  Also, we believe our ability to offer multiple product lines to
our customers helps mitigate the impact of pricing pressures in our well
stimulation operations.  We have seen North America pricing declines
in other product lines as well, including cementing, fluid services, and
wireline and perforating, but they continue to be at lower levels than what we
have seen in our well stimulation business.  While we anticipate
improved activity levels in our United States land operations, we do think there
is downside risk to our operating margins if pricing continues to erode or if
natural gas prices decline significantly.  In Canada, while we
experienced a moderate seasonal recovery in the second half of 2007, our
full-year revenue compared to 2006 declined 22% on a 27% decrease in average
Canada rig count for the year.  Looking ahead, we are not planning on
a significant recovery in Canada in 2008.  Where appropriate, we
reduced personnel and moved equipment to higher utilization areas. 

      Outside
of North America, our outlook remains positive.  Worldwide demand for
hydrocarbons continues to grow, and the reservoirs are becoming more
complex.  The trend toward exploration and exploitation of more
complex reservoirs bodes well for the mix of our product line offerings and
degree of service intensity on a per rig basis.  Therefore, we have
been investing and will continue to invest in infrastructure, capital, and
technology predominantly in the eastern hemisphere, consistent with our
initiative to grow our operations in that part of the world. 

      In 2008,
we will focus on: 

- 

maintaining
      optimal utilization of our equipment and
  resources; 

- 

managing
      pricing, particularly in our North America
  operations; 

- 

hiring
      and training additional personnel to meet the increased demand for our
      services; 

- 

continuing
      the globalization of our manufacturing and supply chain
      processes; 

- 

balancing
      our United States operations by capitalizing on the trend toward
      horizontal drilling; 

- 

leveraging
      our technologies to provide our customers with the ability to more
      efficiently drill and complete their wells and to increase their
      productivity.   To that end, we
      opened one international research and development center with global
      technology and training missions in 2007 and expect to open the second in
      2008; 

- 

maximizing
      our position to win meaningful international tenders, especially in
      deepwater fields, complex reservoirs, and high-pressure/high-temperature
      environments; 

- 

cultivating
      our relationships with national oil
companies; 

13 

- 

pursuing
      strategic acquisitions in line with our core products and services to
      expand our portfolio in key geographic areas;
  and 

- 

directing
      our capital spending primarily toward eastern hemisphere operations for
      service equipment additions and infrastructure.  Capital
      spending for 2008 is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8
      billion. 

Our
operating performance is described in more detail in  Business Environment and
Results of Operations.  

      Separation
of KBR, Inc. 

      In
November 2006, KBR, Inc. (KBR), which at the time was our wholly owned
subsidiary, completed an initial public offering (IPO), in which it sold
approximately 32 million shares of KBR common stock.  On April 5,
2007, we completed the separation of KBR from us by exchanging the 135.6 million
shares of KBR common stock owned by us on that date for 85.3 million shares of
our common stock.  Consequently, KBR operations have been reclassified
as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented.  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information. 

      Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act investigations 

      The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting a formal investigation
into whether improper payments were made to government officials in
Nigeria.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) is also conducting a related
criminal investigation.  See Note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information. 

      Other
corporate matters 

      Subsequent
to the KBR separation, in the third quarter of 2007, we realigned our products
and services to improve operational and cost management efficiencies, better
serve our customers, and become better aligned with the process of exploring for
and producing from oil and natural gas wells.  We now operate under
two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we now
report:  the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and
Evaluation segment. 

      In May
2007, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by $0.015 per
common share, or 20%, to $0.09 per share. 

      In
February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up
to $1.0 billion.  In September 2006, our Board of Directors approved
an increase to our existing common share repurchase program of up to an
additional $2.0 billion.  In July 2007, our Board of Directors
approved an additional increase to our existing common share repurchase program
of up to $2.0 billion, bringing the entire authorization to $5.0
billion.  This additional authorization may be used for open market
share purchases or to settle the conversion premium on our 3.125% convertible
senior notes, should they be redeemed.  From the inception of this
program through December 31, 2007, we have repurchased approximately 79 million
shares of our common stock for approximately $2.7 billion at an average price
per share of $33.91.  These numbers include the repurchases of
approximately 39 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.4
billion at an average price per share of $34.93 during 2007.  As of
December 31, 2007, $2.3 billion remained available under our share repurchase
authorization. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We ended
2007 with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion compared to $2.9 billion at
December 31, 2006. 

      Significant
sources of cash 

      Cash
flows from operating activities contributed $2.7 billion to cash in
2007.  Growth in revenue and operating income are attributable to
higher customer demand and increased service intensity due to a trend toward
exploration and exploitation of more complex reservoirs.  Cash flows
from operating activities included $31 million in cash inflows related to
discontinued operations. 

      In May
2007, we sold our remaining interest in Dresser, Ltd. for $70 million in
cash. 

       Further available sources of
cash.   On July 9, 2007, we entered into a new unsecured $1.2
billion five-year revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing
unsecured $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility.  The
purpose of the new facility is to provide commercial paper support, general
working capital, and credit for other corporate purposes.  There were
no cash drawings under the facility as of December 31, 2007.

expenditures were $1.6 billion in 2007, with increased focus toward building
infrastructure and adding service equipment in support of our expanding
operations in the eastern hemisphere.  Capital expenditures were
predominantly made in the drilling services, production enhancement, wireline,
and cementing product service lines. 

      During
2007, we repurchased approximately 39 million shares of our common stock under
our share repurchase program at a cost of approximately $1.4 billion at an
average price per share of $34.93. 

      During
2007, we invested in approximately $332 million of marketable securities,
consisting of auction-rate securities, variable-rate demand notes, and municipal
bonds. 

      We paid
$314 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2007.  In May 2007,
the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of $0.015 per common
share, bringing quarterly dividends to $0.09 per common share for the remainder
of 2007. 

      In the
third quarter of 2007, we purchased the entire share capital of PSL Energy
Services Limited (PSLES), an eastern hemisphere provider of process, pipeline,
and well intervention services, for $326 million in cash and $4 million in debt
assumed upon acquisition. 

      In
January 2007, we acquired all of the intellectual property, current assets, and
existing wireline services business associated with Ultraline Services
Corporation, a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp., for approximately $178
million. 

       Future uses of
cash.   In July 2007, our Board of Directors approved an
increase to our existing common share repurchase program of up to an additional
$2.0 billion, bringing the entire authorization to $5.0 billion.  This
additional authorization may be used for open market share purchases or to
settle the conversion premium over the face amount of our 3.125% convertible
senior notes, should they be redeemed.  As of December 31, 2007, $2.3
billion remained available under our share repurchase
authorization. 

      Capital
spending for 2008 is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8
billion.  The capital expenditures forecast for 2008 is primarily
directed toward our drilling services, wireline and perforating, production
enhancement, and cementing operations.  We will continue to explore
opportunities for acquisitions that will enhance or augment our current
portfolio of products and services, including those with unique technologies or
distribution networks in areas where we do not already have large
operations.  Further, as market conditions change, we will continue to
evaluate the allocation of our cash between acquisitions and stock buybacks in
order to provide good return for our shareholders. 

      Our
3.125% convertible senior notes become redeemable at our option on or after July
15, 2008.  If we choose to redeem the notes prior to their maturity or
if the holders choose to convert the notes, we must settle the principal amount
of the notes, which totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007, in
cash.  We have the option to settle any amounts due in excess of the
principal, which also totaled approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007,
by delivering shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock
and cash. 

      Subject
to Board of Director approval, we expect to pay dividends of approximately $80
million per quarter in 2008. 

      The
following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other
long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2007:

With the
adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48
(FIN 48), we had $425 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2007, of which we estimate $189 million may require a cash
payment.  We estimate that $102 million may be settled within the next
12 months, although the amounts are not agreed with tax
authorities.  We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future
periods the remaining amounts will ultimately be settled and paid. 

      Other
factors affecting liquidity 

       Letters of
credit.   In the normal course of business, we have agreements
with banks under which approximately $2.2 billion of letters of credit, surety
bonds, or bank guarantees were outstanding as of December 31, 2007, including
$1.1 billion that relate to KBR.  These KBR letters of credit, surety
bonds, or bank guarantees are being guaranteed by us in favor of KBR s customers
and lenders.  KBR has agreed to compensate us for these guarantees and
indemnify us if we are required to perform under any of these
guarantees.  Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering
events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. 

       Credit
ratings.   The credit ratings for our long-term debt are A2 with
Moody s Investors Service and A with Standard   Poor s.  Our
Moody s Investors Service rating became effective May 1, 2007, and was an upward
revision from our previous Moody s Investors Service rating of Baa1, which had
been in effect since December 2005.  Our Standard   Poor s rating
became effective August 20, 2007, and was an upward revision from our previous
Standard   Poor s rating of BBB+, which had been in effect since May
2006.  The credit ratings on our short-term debt are P1 with Moody s
Investors Service and A1 with Standard   Poor s. 

BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We
operate in approximately 70 countries throughout the world to provide a
comprehensive range of discrete and integrated services and products to the
energy industry.  The majority of our consolidated revenue is derived
from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil
and gas companies worldwide.  We serve the upstream oil and gas
industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir:  from locating
hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation,
well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of
the field.  Our two business segments are the Completion and
Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment.  The two
KBR segments have been reclassified as discontinued operations as a result of
the separation of KBR. 

      The
industries we serve are highly competitive with many substantial competitors in
each segment.  In 2007, based upon the location of the services
provided and products sold, 44% of our consolidated revenue was from the United
States.  In 2006, 45% of our consolidated revenue was from the United
States.  In 2005, 43% of our consolidated revenue was from the United
States.  No other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue
during these periods. 

      Operations
in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions,
acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict,
expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, exchange control
problems, and highly inflationary currencies.  We believe the
geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that loss
of operations in any one country would be material to our consolidated results
of operations. 

      Activity
levels within our business segments are significantly impacted by spending on
upstream exploration, development, and production programs by major, national,
and independent oil and gas companies.  Also impacting our activity is
the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and gas
consumption. 

      Some of
the more significant barometers of current and future spending levels of oil and
gas companies are oil and gas prices, the world economy, and global stability,
which together drive worldwide drilling activity.  Our financial
performance is significantly affected by oil and gas prices and worldwide rig
activity, which are summarized in the following tables. 

16 

This
table shows the average oil and gas prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and
United Kingdom Brent crude oil, and Henry Hub natural gas: 

The
yearly average rig counts based on the Baker Hughes Incorporated rig count
information were as follows: 

17 

Our
customers  cash flows, in many instances, depend upon the revenue they generate
from the sale of oil and gas.  Higher oil and gas prices usually
translate into higher exploration and production budgets.  Higher
prices also improve the economic attractiveness of unconventional
reservoirs.  This promotes additional investment by our
customers.  The opposite is true for lower oil and gas
prices. 

      After
declining from record highs during the third and fourth quarters of 2006, WTI
oil spot prices averaged $72.00 per barrel in 2007 and are expected to average
$87.00 per barrel in 2008 according to the Energy Information Administration
(EIA).  Between mid-December 2006 and mid-January 2007, the WTI crude
oil price fell about $12 per barrel to a low of $50.51 per barrel, as warm
weather reduced demand for heating fuels throughout most of the United
States.  However, the WTI price recovered to over $66 per barrel by
the end of March 2007, as the weather turned colder than normal and geopolitical
tensions intensified.  Crude oil prices continued to rise to record
levels over the $99 per barrel mark throughout 2007 due to a tight world oil
supply and demand balance, ending the year at approximately $96 per
barrel.  We expect that oil prices will remain at levels sufficient to
sustain, and likely grow, our customers  current levels of spending due to a
combination of the following factors: 

- 

continued
      growth in worldwide petroleum demand, despite high oil
    prices; 

- 

projected
      production growth in non-Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
      (non-OPEC) supplies is not expected to accommodate world wide demand
      growth; 

- 

OPEC s
      commitment to control production; 

- 

modest
      increases in OPEC s current and forecasted production capacity;
      and 

- 

geopolitical
      tensions in major oil-exporting
nations. 

According
to the International Energy Agency s (IEA) January 2008  Oil Market Report,  the
outlook for world oil demand remains strong, with China, the Middle East, and
Europe accounting for approximately 52% of the expected demand growth in
2008.  Excess oil production capacity is expected to remain
constrained and that, along with increased demand, is expected to keep supplies
tight.  Thus, any unexpected supply disruption or change in demand
could lead to fluctuating prices.  The IEA forecasts world petroleum
demand growth in 2008 to increase 2% over 2007. 

       North America
operations.   Volatility in natural gas prices has the potential
to impact our customers' drilling and production activities, particularly in
North America.  In the first quarter of 2007, we experienced lower
than anticipated customer activity in North America, particularly the pressure
pumping market in Canada and the United States Rockies.  Some of this
activity decline was attributable to poor weather, including an early spring
break-up season in Canada and severe weather early in 2007 in the United States
Rockies and mid-continent regions.  In addition, the unusually warm
start to the United States 2006/2007 winter caused concern about natural gas
storage levels, which negatively impacted the price of natural
gas.  This uncertainty made many of our customers more cautious about
their drilling and production plans in the early part of 2007.  The
second half of 2007 was characterized by increased activity for our United
States customers and recovery in the Gulf of Mexico after the hurricane
season.  Despite recovery from a traditionally slow second quarter
spring break-up season, Canada experienced a significant decline in activity as
compared to 2006.  Beginning in late 2006, we began moving equipment
and personnel from Canada to the United States and Latin America to address the
anticipated slowdown.  In January 2008, the EIA stated that the Henry
Hub spot price averaged $7.17 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2007 and was
projected to average $7.78 per mcf in 2008. 

      It is
common practice in the United States oilfield services industry to sell services
and products based on a price book and then apply discounts to the price book
based upon a variety of factors.  The discounts applied typically
increase to partially offset price book increases.  We experienced
increased pricing pressure from our customers in the North American market in
2007, particularly in Canada and in our United States well stimulation
operations.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, we saw price declines for
our fracturing services in the United States in the low- to mid-single
digits.  While we anticipate improved activity levels in our United
States land operations, we do think there is downside risk to our operating
margins if pricing continues to erode or if natural gas prices decline
significantly. 

18 

Focus on international
growth .  Consistent with our strategy to grow our international
operations, we expect to continue to invest capital and increase manufacturing
capacity to bring new tools online to serve the high demand for our
services.  Following is a brief discussion of some of our recent
initiatives: 

- 

we
      opened a corporate office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, allowing us to
      focus more attention on customer relationships in that part of the world,
      particularly with national oil
companies; 

- 

in
      order to continue to supply our customers with leading-edge services and
      products, we have increased our technology spending during 2007 as
      compared to the prior year.  Our plans are progressing for new
      international research and development centers with global technology and
      training missions.  We opened one in Pune, India in the third
      quarter of 2007, and we expect to open a second facility in Singapore in
      2008; 

- 

we
      are expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity to meet the
      increasing demands for our services and products.  In 2007, we
      opened manufacturing plants in Mexico, Brazil, Malaysia, and
      Singapore.  Having manufacturing facilities closer to our
      worksites allows us to more efficiently deploy equipment to our field
      operations, as well as locally source employees and
    materials; 

- 

as
      our workforce becomes more global, the need for regional training centers
      increases.  To meet the increasing need for technical training,
      we opened a new training center in Tyumen, Russia during the first quarter
      of 2007.  We have also recently expanded training centers in
      Malaysia, Egypt, and Mexico; and 

- 

part
      of our growth strategy includes acquisitions that will enhance or augment
      our current portfolio of products and services, including those with
      unique technologies or distribution networks in areas where we do not
      already have large operations; 

- 

in
      January 2007, we acquired Ultraline Services Company, a provider of
      wireline services in Canada.  Prior to this acquisition, we did
      not have meaningful wireline and perforating operations in
      Canada; 

- 

in
      May 2007, we acquired the intellectual property, assets, and existing
      business associated with Vector Magnetics LLC s active ranging technology
      for steam-assisted gravity drainage
  applications; 

- 

in
      July 2007, we acquired PSL Energy Services Limited, an eastern hemisphere
      provider of process, pipeline, and well intervention
      services.  This acquisition increases our eastern hemisphere
      production enhancement operations significantly, putting us in a strong
      position in pipeline processing services both in the eastern hemisphere
      and globally; 

- 

in
      September 2007, we acquired the intellectual property and substantially
      all of the assets and existing business of GeoSmith Consulting Group, LLC,
      a developer of software components for 3-D interpretation and geometric
      modeling applications; and 

- 

in
      November 2007, we acquired the entire share capital of OOO Burservice, a
      provider of directional drilling services in
  Russia. 

Contract
wins in 2007 are positioning us to grow our international operations over the
coming years. Examples include: 

- 

a
      multiservice contract for work in the Tyumen region of
      Russia.  We will be providing drilling fluids, waste management,
      cementing, drill bits, directional drilling, and logging-while-drilling
      services; 

- 

a
      contract to provide acidizing, acid fracturing, water control, and
      nitrogen stimulation services for a customer in the Bay of Campeche,
      Mexico; 

- 

a
      contract to provide deepwater sand control completion technology in two
      offshore fields of India; 

- 

a
      contract to provide completion products and services to a group of energy
      companies for operations throughout Malaysia for a term of five
      years; 

19 

- 

a
      contract to provide exploration and development testing services in high
      pressure, high temperature environments in
  Brazil; 

- 

a
      five-year contract for sand control completions for over 200 wells in
      offshore China; 

- 

a
      three-year contract to provide a full range of subsurface services,
      including drilling and formation evaluation, slickline, fluids, cementing
      services, and production enhancement in Papua New
  Guinea; 

- 

a
      contract to provide completion products and services in Indonesia;
      and 

- 

a
      contract to manage the drilling and completion of 58 land wells in the
      southern region of Mexico.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 

21 

Note
      1 

All
      periods presented reflect the new segment structure and the
      reclassification of certain amounts between the segments/regions and
       Corporate and other.  

The
increase in consolidated revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 spanned all four
regions in both segments and was attributable to higher worldwide activity,
particularly in Europe, Africa, and the United States.  Revenue
derived from the eastern hemisphere contributed 58% to the total revenue
increase.  International revenue was 56% of consolidated revenue in
2007 and 55% of consolidated revenue in 2006. 

      The
increase in consolidated operating income was primarily derived from the eastern
hemisphere, which increased 26% compared to 2006.  Operating income
for 2007 was positively impacted by a $49 million gain recorded on the sale of
our remaining interest in Dresser, Ltd. and negatively impacted by $34 million
in charges related to the impairment of an oil and gas property and $32 million
in charges for environmental reserves.  Operating income for 2006
included a $48 million gain on the sale of lift boats in west Africa and the
North Sea and $47 million of insurance proceeds for business interruptions
resulting from the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. 

      Following
is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable
segment. 

22 

Completion and Production 
increase in revenue compared to 2006 was derived from all
regions.  Europe/Africa/CIS revenue grew 23% on increased activity
from production enhancement services in Europe and Africa.  The region
also benefited from increased activity in our intelligent well completions joint
venture and increased testing activity and completion product sales in Africa
and improved cementing services pricing in the North Sea and
Russia.  Middle East/Asia revenue grew 30% from increased completion
product sales in Asia, improved completion tools sales in the Middle East, and
new cementing services contracts in the Middle East.  North America
revenue improved 9% largely driven by increased production enhancement services
and cementing services activity in the United States.  The North
America revenue increase was partially offset by lower pricing, particularly in
fracturing, and decreased production enhancement services activity in
Canada.  Latin America revenue increased 30% largely driven by
cementing services revenue increasing on new contracts and improved pricing,
increased stimulation activity in Mexico, and increased testing activity in
Brazil.  International revenue was 47% of total segment revenue in
2007 compared to 45% in 2006. 

      The
Completion and Production segment operating income improvement spanned all
regions except North America.  Europe/Africa/CIS operating income grew
2% from increased activity and improved pricing for cementing services in the
North Sea.  Europe/Africa/CIS segment operating income in 2006
included a $48 million gain on the sale of lift boats in west Africa and the
North Sea.  Middle East/Asia operating income grew 40% from improved
completion product deliveries in Asia and the Middle East and additional
cementing service projects in the Middle East.  North America
operating income decreased 5% largely because the segment received hurricane
insurance proceeds of $21 million in 2006 and due to a decline in production
enhancement services pricing.  Latin America operating income
increased 31% due to new technology and improved pricing for cementing
services. 

       Drilling and Evaluation 
revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was derived from all four
regions.  Europe/Africa/CIS revenue improved 36% from increased
drilling services activity throughout the region, new fluid services contracts
in the North Sea, and increased wireline and perforating services in
Africa.  Middle East/Asia revenue increased 19% from additional
drilling service contract awards and activity in the region, new wireline and
perforating services contracts in Asia, and increased fluid sales in the Middle
East.  North America revenue grew 14% from improvements in all product
service lines, particularly wireline and perforating services and drilling
services.  The United States benefited from increased land rig
activity, particularly for horizontally and directionally drilled
wells.  Latin America revenue improved 12% primarily on increased
activity in drilling services, fluid services, and wireline and perforating
services.  International revenue was 68% of total segment revenue in
2007 compared to 67% in 2006. 

      Drilling
and Evaluation operating income increase compared to 2006 was led by the eastern
hemisphere.  Europe/Africa/CIS Drilling and Evaluation operating
income grew 57% from increased drilling services activity in Europe and
Africa.  Africa also benefited from improved fluid service product mix
and new wireline and perforating projects.  Middle East/Asia operating
income grew 13% from additional drilling service and wireline and perforating
activity in the Middle East and Asia.  Included in the region in 2007
was a $34 million charge related to the impairment of an oil and gas property in
Bangladesh.  Latin America operating income increased 5% from
increased wireline and perforating activity.  Partially offsetting the
improvement was decreased fluid service activity.  North America
operating income fell 7% largely because the segment received hurricane
insurance proceeds of $26 million in 2006 and recorded a $24 million
environmental exposure charge in the third quarter of 2007. 

       Corporate and other  expenses
were $186 million in 2007 compared to $223 million in 2006.  2007
included a $49 million gain recorded on the sale of our remaining interest in
Dresser, Ltd. and a $12 million charge for executive separation
costs. 

NONOPERATING
ITEMS 

Interest expense  decreased
$11 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the repayment in August
2006 of $275 million of our medium-term notes. 

       Interest income  decreased $5
million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to lower average cash
balances. 

23 

(Provision) benefit for income taxes
 from continuing operations in 2007 of $907 million resulted in an
effective tax rate of 26% compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in
2006.  The provision for income taxes in 2007 included a $205 million
favorable income tax impact from the ability to recognize foreign tax credits
previously thought not to be fully utilizable. 

       Income from discontinued operations,
net of income tax provision  in 2007 primarily consisted of an approximate
$933 million net gain recorded on the disposition of KBR.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 

25 

Note
      1 

All
      periods presented reflect the new segment structure and the
      reclassification of certain amounts between the segments/regions and
       Corporate and other.  

The
increase in consolidated revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 predominantly resulted
from increased activity, higher utilization of our equipment, and increased
pricing due to higher exploration and production spending by our
customers.  Revenue in 2005 was impacted by an estimated $80 million
in lost revenue due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.  International
revenue was 55% of consolidated revenue in 2006 and 57% of consolidated revenue
in 2005. 

      The
increase in consolidated operating income was primarily due to improved demand
due to increased rig activity and improved pricing and asset
utilization.  Operating income for 2006 included a $48 million gain on
the sale of lift boats in west Africa and the North Sea and $47 million of
insurance proceeds for business interruptions resulting from the 2005 Gulf of
Mexico hurricanes.  Operating income in 2005 was adversely impacted by
an estimated $45 million due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. 

      Following
is a discussion of our results of operations by reportable
segment. 

26 

Completion and Production 
increase in revenue compared to 2005 was derived from all
regions.  Europe/Africa/CIS revenue grew 28% from increased activity
from production enhancement services.  Completion tools sales
benefited from the addition of Easywell to the completion tool portfolio in
Europe and cementing services improved due to increased activity in Russia, the
North Sea, and Nigeria and improved pricing and sales in
Angola.  Middle East/Asia revenue grew 30% from the addition of
Easywell to the completion tool portfolio in Asia, increased WellDynamics
activity in Asia, a new contract in Oman for production enhancement services,
and new contract start-ups and product sales of cementing services in
Asia.  North America revenue improved 37% largely driven by United
States onshore operations due to strong demand for stimulation services, coupled
with improved equipment utilization and pricing.  Production
enhancement services North America revenue also grew due to improved pricing and
improved equipment utilization in Canada.  Latin America revenue
increased 8%.  International revenue was 45% of total segment revenue
in 2006 compared to 48% in 2005. 

      The
Completion and Production segment operating income improvement spanned all
regions.  Europe/Africa/CIS operating income improved
60%.  The 2006 Europe/Africa/CIS segment operating income was
positively impacted by a $48 million gain on the sale of lift boats in west
Africa and the North Sea.  Cementing services results were also
favorable as a result of new contracts and increased activity in
Europe.  Operating income in 2005 included a $17 million favorable
insurance settlement related to a pipe fabrication and laying project in the
North Sea.  Middle East/Asia operating income grew 41% primarily from
improved production enhancement services product mix and increased completion
tools sales in Asia, which were partially offset by decreased WellDynamics
activity.  North America operating income increased 41% largely due to
an improved production enhancement services product mix and increased cementing
services activity in the United States.  The segment received
hurricane insurance proceeds of $21 million in 2006 and was negatively impacted
by an estimated $24 million in 2005 by hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico.  The 2005 segment operating income included a $110 million
gain on the sale in 2005 of our equity interest in the Subsea 7, Inc. joint
venture.  Latin America operating income increased 3% due primarily to
increased sand control tools activity in Brazil. 

       Drilling and Evaluation 
revenue increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was derived from all four regions in
all product service lines.  Europe/Africa/CIS revenue improved 24%
from new drilling service contracts in Europe.  The fluid services
revenue comparison was also favorable, primarily due to increased activity in
the region.  Middle East/Asia revenue grew 26% from new drilling
services contracts in Asia and increased drill bits activity in the
region.  The region also benefited from increased cased hole activity
in Asia and new wireline and perforating contracts.  Lower sales of
logging equipment and the expiration of a fluid services contract in Asia
partially offset the Middle East/Asia revenue improvement.  North
America revenue grew 28% from improved pricing and increased activity in fluid
services, wireline and perforating services, and drilling services and increased
sales of fixed cutter bits.  Latin America revenue grew 16% with
increased fluid services operations, improved wireline and perforating pricing,
and increased Landmark consulting services and software sales.  The
completion of two fixed-price integrated solutions projects in southern Mexico
partially offset the Latin America revenue improvement.  International
revenue was 67% of total segment revenue in 2006 compared to 68% in
2005. 

      Drilling
and Evaluation operating income increase compared to 2005 spanned all geographic
regions, with the United States as the predominant contributor due to improved
pricing and increased rig activity.  Europe/Africa/CIS operating
income grew 27% from new drilling service contracts in Europe and stronger
software and service sales for Landmark in Europe.  Middle East/Asia
operating income grew 57% from higher wireline and perforating services activity
in the region, new drilling services contracts in Asia, and increased fluid
services activity in Asia.  Latin America operating income more than
doubled.  Wireline and perforating results contributed to the Latin
America increase due to improved product mix.  Included in Latin
America 2005 results was $23 million in losses on two fixed-priced integrated
solutions projects.  The segment received hurricane insurance proceeds
of $26 million in 2006.  Operating income in 2005 included a $24
million gain related to a patent infringement case settlement, while hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico negatively impacted segment operating income by an
estimated $21 million. 

       Corporate and other  expenses
were $223 million in 2006 compared to $200 million in 2005.  The
increase was primarily due to increased legal costs and costs incurred for the
separation of KBR from Halliburton.  The 2006 segment results included
a gain of $10 million from the sale of an investment accounted for under the
cost method. 

27 

NONOPERATING
ITEMS 

Interest expense  decreased
$31 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the redemption in April
2005 of $500 million of our floating rate senior notes, the repayment in October
2005 of $300 million of our floating rate senior notes, and the repayment in
August 2006 of $275 million of our medium-term notes. 

       Interest income  increased $75
million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher cash investment
balances. 

       Other, net  increased $15
million in 2006 compared to 2005.  The 2005 year included costs
related to our accounts receivable securitization facility, which had no
outstanding amounts. 

       (Provision) benefit for income taxes
 from continuing operations in 2006 of $1 billion resulted in an effective
tax rate of 31%.  The tax benefit for 2005 resulted from recording
favorable adjustments in 2005 totaling $805 million to our valuation allowance
against the deferred tax asset related to asbestos and silica
liabilities.  Our strong 2005 earnings, coupled with an upward
revision in our estimate of future domestic taxable income in 2006, drove these
adjustments. 

       Income from discontinued operations,
net of income tax provision  in 2006 and 2005 primarily consisted of our
results of KBR. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and
estimates.  Our critical accounting policies are described below to
provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments
about future events and related estimations and how they can impact our
financial statements.  A critical accounting estimate is one that
requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex estimates and assessments
and is fundamental to our results of operations.  We identified our
most critical accounting policies and estimates to be: 

- 

forecasting
      our effective tax rate, including our future ability to utilize foreign
      tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets, and providing
      for uncertain tax positions; 

- 

percentage-of-completion
      accounting for long-term, construction-type
  contracts; 

- 

legal
      and investigation matters; 

- 

valuations
      of indemnities; 

- 

pensions;
      and 

- 

allowance
      for bad debts. 

We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we
believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources.  We believe the following are the critical accounting
policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as
well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of
these policies.  This discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in this report. 

      We have
discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit
Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below. 

      Income
tax accounting 

      We
account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS No. 109),  Accounting for Income Taxes,  which requires
recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.  We apply the
following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes: 

- 

a
      current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes
      payable or refundable on tax returns for the current
  year; 

- 

a
      deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax
      effects attributable to temporary differences and
      carryforwards; 

28 

- 

the
      measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on
      provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future
      changes in tax laws or rates are not considered;
  and 

- 

the
      value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of
      any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be
      realized. 

We
determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or
a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax
jurisdiction.  That determination includes the following
procedures: 

- 

identifying
      the types and amounts of existing temporary
  differences; 

- 

measuring
      the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using
      the applicable tax rate; 

- 

measuring
      the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and
      operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax
  rate; 

- 

measuring
      the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward;
      and 

- 

reducing
      the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available
      evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
      deferred tax assets will not be
realized. 

Our
methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment
in the use of assumptions and estimates.  Additionally, we use
forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit
utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning
strategies.  Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of
such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and
actual results.  Unforeseen events may significantly impact these
variables, and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our
income tax accounts related to both continuing and discontinued
operations. 

      We have
operations in approximately 70 countries other than the United
States.  Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a
significant number of taxing authorities.  The income earned in these
various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including income actually
earned, income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding.  The
final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local
tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each
jurisdiction.  Changes in the operating environment, including changes
in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of
our tax liabilities for a tax year. 

      Tax
filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates, and related entities are
routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax
authorities.  These examinations may result in assessments of
additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through
the judicial process.  Predicting the outcome of disputed assessments
involves some uncertainty.  Factors such as the availability of
settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the
operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax
jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate
outcome.  We review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize
assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide
taxes, interest, and penalties as needed based on this outcome.  We
provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to FIN 48,  Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
109.   FIN 48, as amended May 2007 by FASB Staff Position FIN 48-1,
 Definition of  Settlement  in FASB Interpretation No. 48,  prescribes a minimum
recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized
in the financial statements.  It also provides guidance for
derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. 

      We had
recorded a valuation allowance based on the anticipated inability to utilize
future foreign tax credits in the United States as of the end of
2006.  This valuation allowance is reassessed quarterly based on a
number of estimates, including future creditable foreign taxes and future
taxable income.  Factors such as actual operating results, material
acquisitions or dispositions, and changes to our operating environment could
alter the estimates, which could have a material impact on the valuation
allowance.  Given that we fully utilized the United States net
operating loss and began utilizing foreign tax credits in the United States in
2006, the valuation allowance balance has been reduced to zero as of the end of
2007.  In addition, the provision for income taxes in 2007 included a
favorable income tax adjustment from the ability to recognize foreign tax
credits previously generated in 2005 and 2006 thought not to be fully
utilizable.  We now believe we can utilize these credits currently
because we have generated additional taxable income and expect to continue to
generate a higher level of taxable income largely from the growth of our
international operations. 

29 

Percentage
of completion 

      Revenue
from long-term contracts to provide well construction and completion services is
reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  This
method of accounting requires us to calculate job profit to be recognized in
each reporting period for each job based upon our projections of future
outcomes, which include: 

- 

estimates
      of the total cost to complete the
project; 

- 

estimates
      of project schedule and completion
date; 

- 

estimates
      of the extent of progress toward completion;
and 

- 

amounts
      of any probable unapproved claims and change orders included in
      revenue. 

Progress
is generally based upon physical progress related to contractually defined units
of work.  At the outset of each contract, we prepare a detailed
analysis of our estimated cost to complete the project.  Risks related
to service delivery, usage, productivity, and other factors are considered in
the estimation process.  Our project personnel periodically evaluate
the estimated costs, claims, change orders, and percentage of completion at the
project level.  The recording of profits and losses on long-term
contracts requires an estimate of the total profit or loss over the life of each
contract.  This estimate requires consideration of total contract
value, change orders, and claims, less costs incurred and estimated costs to
complete.  Anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the
period in which they become evident.  Profits are recorded based upon
the total estimated contract profit times the current percentage complete for
the contract. 

      When
calculating the amount of total profit or loss on a long-term contract, we
include unapproved claims as revenue when the collection is deemed probable
based upon the four criteria for recognizing unapproved claims under the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1,
 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts.   Including probable unapproved claims in this calculation
increases the operating income (or reduces the operating loss) that would
otherwise be recorded without consideration of the probable unapproved
claims.  Probable unapproved claims are recorded to the extent of
costs incurred and include no profit element.  In all cases, the
probable unapproved claims included in determining contract profit or loss are
less than the actual claim that will be or has been presented to the
customer. 

      At least
quarterly, significant projects are reviewed in detail by senior
management.  There are many factors that impact future costs,
including but not limited to weather, inflation, labor and community
disruptions, timely availability of materials, productivity, and other factors
as outlined in our  Risk Factors.   These factors can affect the
accuracy of our estimates and materially impact our future reported
earnings. 

      Legal
and investigation matters 

      As
discussed in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements, as of December
31, 2007, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for
the resolution of some of these legal and investigation matters.  For
other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable,
we have not accrued any amounts.  Attorneys in our legal department
monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending
investigations.  Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to
these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal
counsel representing us.  Our estimates are based upon an analysis of
potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement
strategies.  The precision of these estimates is impacted by the
amount of due diligence we have been able to perform.  We attempt to
resolve these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration
proceedings when possible.  If the actual settlement costs, final
judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, our future
financial results may be adversely affected.  We have in the past
recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of
contingencies. 

30 

Indemnity
valuations 

      We
provided indemnification in favor of KBR for certain contingent liabilities
related to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations and the
Barracuda-Caratinga bolts matter.  See Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements for further information.  FASB Interpretation No.
45 (FIN 45),  Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others   An Interpretation of
FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
34,  requires recognition of third-party indemnities at their
inception.  Therefore, in accordance with FIN 45 ,  we recorded our estimate of
the fair market value of these indemnities as of the date of KBR s
separation.  The amounts recorded for the FCPA and Barracuda-Caratinga
indemnities were based upon analyses conducted by a third-party valuation
expert.  The valuation models employed a probability-weighted cost
analysis, with certain assumptions based upon the accumulation of data and
knowledge of the relevant issues.  Periodically, a determination will
be made as to whether any material changes in facts or circumstances have
occurred that would impact assumptions used in the third-party
valuation. 

      Pensions 

      Our
pension benefit obligations and expenses are calculated using actuarial models
and methods, in accordance with   SFAS No. 158,  Employers 
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).   Two of the
more critical assumptions and estimates used in the actuarial calculations are
the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the
expected rate of return on plan assets.  Other critical assumptions
and estimates used in determining benefit obligations and plan expenses,
including demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover,
are also evaluated periodically and updated accordingly to reflect our actual
experience. 

      Discount
rates are determined annually and are based on the prevailing market rate of a
portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected
timing of the payment of the benefit obligations.  Expected long-term
rates of return on plan assets are determined annually and are based on an
evaluation of our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into
account current and expected market conditions.  Plan assets are
comprised primarily of equity and debt securities.  As we have both
domestic and international plans, these assumptions differ based on varying
factors specific to each particular country or economic
environment. 

      The
discount rate utilized in 2007 to determine the projected benefit obligation at
the measurement date for our United States non-terminating pension plans ranged
from 6.03% to 6.19%, an increase from the 5.75% discount rate that was utilized
in 2006.  The discount rate utilized to determine the projected
benefit obligation at the measurement date for our United Kingdom pension plan,
which constitutes 76% of our international plans and 67% of all plans, increased
from 5.0% at September 30, 2006 to 5.7% at September 30, 2007.  The
following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions,
holding all other assumptions constant, for the United Kingdom pension
plan. 

31 

Our
defined benefit plans reduced pretax earnings by $48 million in 2007, $45
million in 2006, and $37 million in 2005.  Included in the amounts
were earnings from our expected pension returns of $47 million in 2007, $37
million in 2006, and $35 million in 2005.  Unrecognized actuarial
gains and losses were being recognized over a period of one to 24 years, which
represented the expected remaining service life of the employee
group.  Our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arose from several
factors, including experience and assumptions changes in the obligations and the
difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan
assets.  Actual returns were $68 million in 2007, $65 million in 2006,
and $83 million in 2005.  The difference between actual and expected
returns is deferred and recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income as
actuarial gain or loss and is recognized as future pension
expense.  Our net actuarial loss, net of tax, at December 31, 2007 was
$46 million.  On a pretax basis, $3 million of our net actuarial loss
at December 31, 2007 will be recognized as a component of our expected 2008
pension expense.  During 2007, we made contributions to fund our
defined benefit plans of $41 million, which included $16 million contributed to
our United Kingdom plan.  We expect to make additional contributions
in 2008 of approximately $30 million. 

      The
actuarial assumptions used in determining our pension benefits may differ
materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions,
higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of
participants.  While we believe that the assumptions used are
appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
materially affect our financial position or results of operations. 

      Allowance
for bad debts 

      We
evaluate our accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our
portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis.  This process
consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging
status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and
whether the receivables involve retentions.  We also consider the
economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic
perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance.  Based on our
review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific
customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole.  This
process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation, and frequently
involves significant dollar amounts.  Accordingly, our results of
operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual
write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.  Our estimates of
allowances for bad debts have historically been accurate.  Over the
last five years, our estimates of allowances for bad debts, as a percentage of
notes and accounts receivable before the allowance, have ranged from 1.5% to
7.3%.  At December 31, 2007, allowance for bad debts totaled $49
million or 1.6% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance, and at
December 31, 2006, allowance for bad debts totaled $40 million or 1.5% of notes
and accounts receivable before the allowance.  A 1% change in our
estimate of the collectibility of our notes and accounts receivable balance as
of December 31, 2007 would have resulted in a $31 million adjustment to 2007
total operating costs and expenses. 

OFF
BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

At
December 31, 2007, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements, except for
operating leases.  For information on our contractual obligations
related to operating leases, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources
  Future uses of cash.  

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK 

We are
exposed to financial instrument market risk from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates, and, to a limited extent, commodity
prices.  From time to time, we may selectively manage these exposures
through the use of derivative instruments to mitigate our market risk from these
exposures.  The objective of our risk management program is to protect
our cash flows related to sales or purchases of goods or services from market
fluctuations in currency rates.  We do not use derivative instruments
for trading purposes.  Our use of derivative instruments includes the
following types of market risk: 

- 

volatility
      of the currency rates; 

- 

time
      horizon of the derivative
instruments; 

32 

- 

market
      cycles; and 

- 

the
      type of derivative instruments
used. 

We do not
consider any of these risk management activities to be material.  See
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on
our accounting policies on derivative instruments.  See Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to
financial instruments. 

      Interest
rate risk 

      We have
exposure to interest rate risk from our long-term debt. 

      The
following table represents principal amounts of our long-term debt at December
31, 2007 and related weighted average interest rates on the repaid amounts by
year of maturity for our long-term debt. 

The fair
market value of long-term debt was $4.1 billion as of December 31,
2007.  The excess of the fair value of long-term debt over the
carrying amount of long-term debt is primarily due to the impact of the
increased value of our common stock on our 3.125% convertible senior
notes. 

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS 

We are
subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related to
our operations worldwide.  In the United States, these laws and
regulations include, among others: 

- 

the
      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
      Act; 

- 

the
      Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act; 

- 

the
      Clean Air Act; 

- 

the
      Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
and 

- 

the
      Toxic Substances Control Act. 

In
addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
we do business may have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
requirements by which we must abide.  We evaluate and address the
environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated
properties in order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental,
legal, and regulatory requirements.  On occasion, we are involved in
specific environmental litigation and claims, including the remediation of
properties we own or have operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct
compliance-related matters.  Our Health, Safety and Environment group
has several programs in place to maintain environmental leadership and to
prevent the occurrence of environmental contamination. 

      We do not
expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
operations.  Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were
$72 million as of December 31, 2007 and $39 million as of December 31,
2006.  Our total liability related to environmental matters covers
numerous properties, including the property in regard to which Dirt, Inc. has
brought suit against Bredero-Shaw (a joint venture in which we formerly held a
50% interest that we sold to the other party in the venture, ShawCor Ltd., in
2002), Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and ShawCor Ltd.  See Note
10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding
this matter. 

33 

We have
subsidiaries that have been named as potentially responsible parties along with
other third parties for 9 federal and state superfund sites for which we have
established a liability.  As of December 31, 2007, those 9 sites
accounted for approximately $10 million of our total $72 million
liability.  For any particular federal or state superfund site, since
our estimated liability is typically within a range and our accrued liability
may be the amount on the low end of that range, our actual liability could
eventually be well in excess of the amount accrued.  Despite attempts
to resolve these superfund matters, the relevant regulatory agency may at any
time bring suit against us for amounts in excess of the amount
accrued.  With respect to some superfund sites, we have been named a
potentially responsible party by a regulatory agency; however, in each of those
cases, we do not believe we have any material liability.  We also
could be subject to third-party claims with respect to environmental matters for
which we have been named as a potentially responsible party. 

NEW
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Effective
January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),  Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
109.   FIN 48, as amended May 2007 by FASB Staff Position FIN 48-1,
 Definition of  settlement  in FASB Interpretation No. 48,  prescribes a minimum
recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized
in the financial statements.  It also provides guidance for
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. 

      As a
result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a decrease of $4 million in
other liabilities to account for a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits and an
increase of $34 million for accrued interest and penalties, which were accounted
for as a net reduction of $30 million to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings.  Of the $30 million reduction to retained earnings, $10
million was attributable to KBR, which is now reported as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements.  See Note 11 to
our consolidated financial statements for further information. 

      In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).   SFAS No. 158 requires an employer
to: 

- 

recognize
      on its balance sheet the funded status (measured as the difference between
      the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation) of pension and
      other postretirement benefit plans; 

- 

recognize,
      through comprehensive income, certain changes in the funded status of a
      defined benefit and postretirement plan in the year in which the changes
      occur; 

- 

measure
      plan assets and benefit obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal
      year; and 

- 

disclose
      additional information. 

The
requirements to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the additional
disclosure requirements were effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2006.  Accordingly, we adopted SFAS No. 158 for our fiscal year
ending December 31, 2006.  See Note 15 to our consolidated financial
statements for further information. 

      The
requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the
employer s fiscal year-end is effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2008.  We did not elect early adoption of these additional SFAS
No. 158 requirements and will adopt these requirements for our fiscal year
ending December 31, 2008. 

34 

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements,  which
is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
by defining fair value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value, and
expanding disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years.  In November 2007, the FASB deferred for one year the
application of the fair value measurement requirements to nonfinancial assets
and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value
on a recurring basis.  On January 1, 2008, we adopted without material
impact on our consolidated financial statements the provisions of SFAS No. 157
related to financial assets and liabilities and to nonfinancial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Beginning
January 1, 2009, we will adopt the provisions for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

      In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115.   SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible
assets and liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007.  We adopted SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008 and did
not elect to apply the fair value method to any eligible assets or liabilities
at that time. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(Revised 2007),  Business
Combinations  (SFAS No. 141(R)).  SFAS No. 141(R) requires an
acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions.  SFAS No. 141(R) also changes the accounting treatment for
certain specific items.  SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  We
will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) for business combinations on or
after January 1, 2009. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,  Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements   An Amendment of ARB No. 51.   SFAS
No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary.  This statement requires the recognition of a
noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated
financial statements and separate from the parent s equity.  SFAS No.
160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  We will adopt the provision
of SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009 and have not yet determined the impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF 07-1,  Accounting

of Intellectual Property.   EITF 07-1 defines collaborative
arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between
participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
arrangement and third parties.  EITF 07-1 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim
periods within those fiscal years.  We will adopt EITF 07-1 on January
1, 2009, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION 

The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions
for forward-looking information.  Forward-looking information is based
on projections and estimates, not historical information.  Some
statements in this Form 10-K are forward-looking and use words like  may,   may
not,   believes,   do not believe,   expects,   do not expect,   anticipates, 
 do not anticipate,  and other expressions.  We may also provide oral
or written forward-looking information in other materials we release to the
public.  Forward-looking information involves risk and uncertainties
and reflects our best judgment based on current information.  Our
results of operations can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by
known or unknown risks and uncertainties.  In addition, other factors
may affect the accuracy of our forward-looking information.  As a
result, no forward-looking information can be guaranteed.  Actual
events and the results of operations may vary materially. 

35 

We do not
assume any responsibility to publicly update any of our forward-looking
statements regardless of whether factors change as a result of new information,
future events, or for any other reason.  You should review any
additional disclosures we make in our press releases and Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and
8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC.  We also suggest that you
listen to our quarterly earnings release conference calls with financial
analysts. 

      While it
is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking
statements and potentially materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. 

RISK
FACTORS 

Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act Investigations 

      The SEC
is conducting a formal investigation into whether improper payments were made to
government officials in Nigeria through the use of agents or subcontractors in
connection with the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a
multibillion dollar natural gas liquefaction complex and related facilities at
Bonny Island in Rivers State, Nigeria.  The Department of Justice
(DOJ) is also conducting a related criminal investigation.  The SEC
has also issued subpoenas seeking information, which we and KBR are furnishing,
regarding current and former agents used in connection with multiple projects,
including current and prior projects, over the past 20 years located both in and
outside of Nigeria in which the Halliburton energy services business, KBR or
affiliates, subsidiaries or joint ventures of Halliburton or KBR, are or were
participants.  In September 2006 and October 2007, the SEC and the
DOJ, respectively, each requested that we enter into an agreement to extend the
statute of limitations with respect to its investigation.  We
anticipate that we will enter into appropriate tolling agreements with the SEC
and the DOJ. 

      TSKJ is a
private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem
SpA of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown   Root LLC (a
subsidiary of KBR), each of which had an approximate 25% interest in the
venture.  TSKJ and other similarly owned entities entered into various
contracts to build and expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG
Limited, which is owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell
Gas B.V., Cleag Limited (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an
affiliate of ENI SpA of Italy). 

      The SEC
and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements of
the FCPA.  In addition to performing our own investigation, we have
been cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ investigations and with other
investigations in France, Nigeria, and Switzerland regarding the Bonny Island
project.  The government of Nigeria gave notice in 2004 to the French
magistrate of a civil claim as an injured party in the French
investigation.  We also believe that the Serious Fraud Office in the
United Kingdom is conducting an investigation relating to the Bonny Island
project.  Our Board of Directors has appointed a committee of
independent directors to oversee and direct the FCPA
investigations. 

      The
matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
of Dresser Industries and continuing through the current time
period).  We have produced documents to the SEC and the DOJ from the
files of numerous officers and employees of Halliburton and KBR, including
current and former executives of Halliburton and KBR, both voluntarily and
pursuant to company subpoenas from the SEC and a grand jury, and we are making
our employees and we understand KBR is making its employees available to the SEC
and the DOJ for interviews.  In addition, the SEC has issued a
subpoena to A. Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a consultant and chairman of
Kellogg Brown   Root LLC, and to others, including certain of our and KBR s
current or former executive officers or employees, and at least one
subcontractor of KBR.  We further understand that the DOJ has issued
subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we understand
that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ and the SEC
with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
subpoenas. 

36 

The SEC
and DOJ investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ s engagements of
Tri-Star Investments as an agent and a Japanese trading company as a
subcontractor to provide services to TSKJ were utilized to make improper
payments to Nigerian government officials.  In connection with the
Bonny Island project, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements, including
with Tri-Star Investments, of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal, commencing in
1995 and a series of subcontracts with a Japanese trading company commencing in
1996.  We understand that a French magistrate has officially placed
Mr. Tesler under investigation for corruption of a foreign public
official.  In Nigeria, a legislative committee of the National
Assembly and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is organized as
part of the executive branch of the government, are also investigating these
matters.  Our representatives have met with the French magistrate and
Nigerian officials.  In October 2004, representatives of TSKJ
voluntarily testified before the Nigerian legislative committee. 

      TSKJ
suspended the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and
the Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements.  In
February 2005, TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not
oppose the Attorney General s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in
accounts of Tri-Star Investments in banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria
and to have the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian
courts. 

      As a
result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
officials.  We have reason to believe that, based on the ongoing
investigations, payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian
officials.  In addition, information uncovered in the summer of 2006
suggests that, prior to 1998, plans may have been made by employees of The M.W.
Kellogg Company (a predecessor of a KBR subsidiary) to make payments to
government officials in connection with the pursuit of a number of other
projects in countries outside of Nigeria.  We are reviewing a number
of more recently discovered documents related to KBR s activities in countries
outside of Nigeria with respect to agents for projects after
1998.  Certain activities discussed in this paragraph involve current
or former employees or persons who were or are consultants to KBR, and our
investigation is continuing. 

      In June
2004, all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant and former
employee of M.W. Kellogg Limited were terminated.  The terminations
occurred because of Code of Business Conduct violations that allegedly involved
the receipt of improper personal benefits from Mr. Tesler in connection with
TSKJ s construction of the Bonny Island project. 

      In 2006
and 2007, KBR suspended the services of other agents in and outside of Nigeria,
including one agent who, until such suspension, had worked for KBR outside of
Nigeria on several current projects and on numerous older projects going back to
the early 1980s.  Such suspensions have occurred when possible
improper conduct has been discovered or alleged or when Halliburton and KBR have
been unable to confirm the agent s compliance with applicable law and the Code
of Business Conduct. 

      The SEC
and DOJ are also investigating and have issued subpoenas concerning TSKJ's use
of an immigration services provider, apparently managed by a Nigerian
immigration official, to which approximately $1.8 million in payments in excess
of costs of visas were allegedly made between approximately 1997 and the
termination of the provider in December 2004.  We understand that TSKJ
terminated the immigration services provider after a KBR employee discovered the
issue.  We reported this matter to the United States government in
2007.  The SEC has issued a subpoena requesting documents among other
things concerning any payment of anything of value to Nigerian government
officials.  In response to such subpoena, we have produced and
continue to produce additional documents regarding KBR and Halliburton s energy
services business use of immigration and customs service providers, which may
result in further inquiries.  Furthermore, as a result of these
matters, we have expanded our own investigation to consider any matters raised
by energy services activities in Nigeria. 

37 

If
violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
remedies, including disgorgement (if applicable) generally of profits, including
prejudgment interest on such profits, causally connected to the violation, and
injunctive relief.  Criminal penalties could range up to the greater
of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the
violation, which could be substantially greater than $2 million per
violation.  It is possible that both the SEC and the DOJ could assert
that there have been multiple violations, which could lead to multiple
fines.  The amount of any fines or monetary penalties that could be
assessed would depend on, among other factors, the findings regarding the
amount, timing, nature, and scope of any improper payments, whether any such
payments were authorized by or made with knowledge of us, KBR or our or KBR s
affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss involved, and the level
of cooperation provided the government authorities during the
investigations.  The government has expressed concern regarding the
level of our cooperation.  Agreed dispositions of these types of
violations also frequently result in an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the
entity and the appointment of a monitor on terms negotiated with the SEC and the
DOJ to review and monitor current and future business practices, including the
retention of agents, with the goal of assuring compliance with the
FCPA. 

      These
investigations could also result in third-party claims against us, which may
include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages,
damage to our business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow,
assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or business
value or claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors,
attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of us
or our current or former subsidiaries.  In addition, we could incur
costs and expenses for any monitor required by or agreed to with a governmental
authority to review our continued compliance with FCPA law. 

      As of
December 31, 2007, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or a
range of possible loss related to these matters as it relates to Halliburton
directly.  However, we provided indemnification in favor of KBR under
the master separation agreement for certain contingent liabilities, including
Halliburton s indemnification of KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned
subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006, the date of the master separation
agreement, for fines or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages,
including disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a
governmental authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Nigeria, Switzerland, and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to
alleged or actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the FCPA or
particular, analogous applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules, and regulations
in connection with investigations pending as of that date, including with
respect to the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a natural gas
liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
Nigeria.  We recorded the estimated fair market value of this
indemnity regarding FCPA matters described above upon our separation from
KBR.  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for
additional information. 

      Our
indemnification obligation to KBR does not include losses resulting from
third-party claims against KBR, including claims for special, indirect,
derivative or consequential damages, nor does our indemnification apply to
damage to KBR s business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash
flow, assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or
business value or claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders or
constituents of KBR or KBR s current or former subsidiaries. 

      In
consideration of our agreement to indemnify KBR for the liabilities referred to
above, KBR has agreed that we will at all times, in our sole discretion, have
and maintain control over the investigation, defense and/or settlement of these
FCPA matters until such time, if any, that KBR exercises its right to assume
control of the investigation, defense and/or settlement of the FCPA matters as
it relates to KBR.  KBR has also agreed, at our expense, to assist
with Halliburton s full cooperation with any governmental authority in our
investigation of these FCPA matters and our investigation, defense and/or
settlement of any claim made by a governmental authority or court relating to
these FCPA matters, in each case even if KBR assumes control of these FCPA
matters as it relates to KBR.  If KBR takes control over the
investigation, defense, and/or settlement of FCPA matters, refuses a settlement
of FCPA matters negotiated by us, enters into a settlement of FCPA matters
without our consent, or materially breaches its obligation to cooperate with
respect to our investigation, defense, and/or settlement of FCPA matters, we may
terminate the indemnity. 

38 

Barracuda-Caratinga
Arbitration 

      We also
provided indemnification in favor of KBR under the master separation agreement
for all out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses (except for legal fees and other
expenses of the arbitration so long as KBR controls and directs it), or cash
settlements or cash arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after
November 20, 2006 as a result of the replacement of certain subsea flowline
bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
project.  Under the master separation agreement, KBR currently
controls the defense, counterclaim, and settlement of the subsea flowline bolts
matter.  As a condition of our indemnity, for any settlement to be
binding upon us, KBR must secure our prior written consent to such settlement s
terms.  We have the right to terminate the indemnity in the event KBR
enters into any settlement without our prior written consent.  See
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding the KBR indemnification. 

      At
Petrobras  direction, KBR replaced certain bolts located on the subsea flowlines
that failed through mid-November 2005, and KBR has informed us that additional
bolts have failed thereafter, which were replaced by Petrobras.  These
failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted inspections of the
bolts.  A key issue in the arbitration is which party is responsible
for the designation of the material to be used for the bolts.  We
understand that KBR believes that an instruction to use the particular bolts was
issued by Petrobras, and as such, KBR believes the cost resulting from any
replacement is not KBR s responsibility.  We understand Petrobras
disagrees.  We understand KBR believes several possible solutions may
exist, including replacement of the bolts.  Estimates indicate that
costs of these various solutions range up to $140 million.  In March
2006, Petrobras commenced arbitration against KBR claiming $220 million plus
interest for the cost of monitoring and replacing the defective bolts and all
related costs and expenses of the arbitration, including the cost of attorneys 
fees.  We understand KBR is vigorously defending and pursuing recovery
of the costs incurred to date through the arbitration process and to that end
has submitted a counterclaim in the arbitration seeking the recovery of $22
million.  The arbitration panel has set an evidentiary hearing in
April 2008. 

Impairment
of Oil and Gas Properties 

      At
December 31, 2007, we had interests in oil and gas properties totaling $110
million, net of accumulated depletion, which we account for under the successful
efforts method.  The majority of this amount is related to one
property in Bangladesh in which we have a 25% non-operating
interest.  These oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment
whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the properties 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  The expected future cash
flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based
on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices, and costs,
considering all available information at the date of review. 

      In
December 2007, we learned that the drilling program in which we were engaged on
one of two prospects in Bangladesh was unsuccessful.  Consequently, we
recorded a $34 million charge for the write-off of our drilling costs and
impairment of the leasehold carrying value.  This charge is included
in our results of operations for 2007.  We expect to know the results
of the drilling activity on the second prospect by the end of the first quarter
of 2008.  Depending on the results, we could incur additional
charges. 

      A
downward trend in estimates of production volumes or prices or an upward trend
in costs could result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties, which in
turn could have a material and adverse effect on our results of
operations. 

Geopolitical
and International Environment 

      International
and political events 

      A
significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States
operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the
countries in which we transact business.  The occurrence of any of the
risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 

      Our
operations in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately
56% of our consolidated revenue during 2007 and 55% of our consolidated revenue
during 2006.  Operations in countries other than the United States are
subject to various risks unique to each country.  With respect to any
particular country, these risks may include: 

39 

- 

expropriation
      and nationalization of our assets in that
  country; 

- 

political
      and economic instability; 

- 

civil
      unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, or other armed
      conflict; 

- 

natural
      disasters, including those related to earthquakes and
      flooding; 

- 

inflation; 

- 

currency
      fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion
  restrictions; 

- 

confiscatory
      taxation or other adverse tax
policies; 

- 

governmental
      activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments, or limit the
      movement of funds; 

- 

governmental
      activities that may result in the deprivation of contract rights;
      and 

- 

governmental
      activities that may result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses
      required for operation. 

Due to
the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries, our revenue
and profits are subject to the adverse consequences of war, the effects of
terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, currency controls, and governmental
actions.  Countries where we operate that have significant political
risk include:  Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, Russia, Venezuela, and
Yemen.  In addition, military action or continued unrest in the Middle
East could impact the supply and pricing for oil and gas, disrupt our operations
in the region and elsewhere, and increase our costs for security
worldwide. 

      In
addition, investigations by governmental authorities (see  Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act investigations  above), as well as legal, social, economic, and
political issues in Nigeria, could materially and adversely affect our Nigerian
business and operations. 

      Our
facilities and our employees are under threat of attack in some countries where
we operate.  In addition, the risks related to loss of life of our
personnel and our subcontractors in these areas continue. 

      We are
also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners, and agents
outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable
laws. 

      Military
action, other armed conflicts, or terrorist attacks 

      Military
action in Iraq, military tension involving North Korea and Iran, as well as the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks,
threats of attacks, and unrest, have caused instability or uncertainty in the
world s financial and commercial markets and have significantly increased
political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we
operate.  Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or
around various areas in which we operate, such as the Middle East, Nigeria, and
Indonesia, could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including
disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of
contracts, or the loss of personnel or assets. 

      Such
events may cause further disruption to financial and commercial markets and may
generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic
areas in which we operate.  In addition, any possible reprisals as a
consequence of the war and ongoing military action in Iraq, such as acts of
terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, could materially and adversely
affect us in ways we cannot predict at this time. 

      Income
taxes 

      We have
operations in approximately 70 countries other than the United
States.  Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a
significant number of taxing authorities.  The income earned in these
various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually
earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax
withholding.  The final determination of our tax liabilities involves
the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in
each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions
regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and
nature of income earned and expenditures incurred.  Changes in the
operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and
currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our tax
liabilities for a tax year. 

40 

Foreign
exchange and currency risks 

      A sizable
portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses is in
foreign currencies.  As a result, we are subject to significant risks,
including: 

- 

foreign
      exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the
      implementation of exchange controls;
and 

- 

limitations
      on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund
      the capital needs of our operations in other
  countries. 

We
conduct business in countries, such as Venezuela, that have nontraded or  soft 
currencies which, because of their restricted or limited trading markets, may be
more difficult to exchange for  hard  currency.  We may accumulate
cash in soft currencies, and we may be limited in our ability to convert our
profits into United States dollars or to repatriate the profits from those
countries. 

      We
selectively use hedging transactions to limit our exposure to risks from doing
business in foreign currencies.  For those currencies that are not
readily convertible, our ability to hedge our exposure is limited because
financial hedge instruments for those currencies are nonexistent or
limited.  Our ability to hedge is also limited because pricing of
hedging instruments, where they exist, is often volatile and not necessarily
efficient. 

      In
addition, the value of the derivative instruments could be impacted
by: 

- 

adverse
      movements in foreign exchange
rates; 

- 

interest
      rates; 

- 

commodity
      prices; or 

- 

the
      value and time period of the derivative being different than the exposures
      or cash flows being hedged. 

Customers
and Business 

      Exploration
and production activity 

      Demand
for our services and products depends on oil and natural gas industry activity
and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural
gas prices. 

      Demand
for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of
exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding
capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil
companies.  Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large
fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand
for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that
are beyond our control.  Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural
gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development, and
production activity, often reflected as changes in rig
counts.  Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices
by oil and gas companies or longer-term higher material and contractor prices
impacting facility costs can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given
the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.  Lower
levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our oil
and natural gas well services and products, which could have a material adverse
effect on our revenue and profitability.  Factors affecting the prices
of oil and natural gas include: 

- 

governmental
      regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the
      exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural
      gas reserves; 

- 

global
      weather conditions and natural
disasters; 

- 

worldwide
      political, military, and economic
conditions; 

- 

the
      level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess
      production capacity within OPEC; 

- 

economic
      growth in China and India; 

- 

oil
      refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel
      efficiency and the use of natural
gas; 

- 

the
      cost of producing and delivering oil and
gas; 

- 

potential
      acceleration of development of alternative fuels;
  and 

- 

the
      level of demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural gas
      in the United States. 

41 

Historically,
the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be
volatile.  Spending on exploration and production activities by large
oil and gas companies have a significant impact on the activity levels of our
businesses.  In the current environment where oil and gas demand
exceeds supply, the ability to rebalance supply with demand may be constrained
by the global availability of rigs.  Full utilization of rigs could
lead to limited growth in revenue.  In addition, the extent of the
growth in oilfield services may be limited by the availability of equipment and
manpower. 

      Capital
spending 

      Our
business is directly affected by changes in capital expenditures by our
customers.  Some of the changes that may materially and adversely
affect us include: 

- 

the
      consolidation of our customers, which
could: 

- 

cause
      customers to reduce their capital spending, which would in turn reduce the
      demand for our services and products;
and 

- 

result
      in customer personnel changes, which in turn affect the timing of contract
      negotiations; 

- 

adverse
      developments in the business and operations of our customers in the oil
      and gas industry, including write-downs of reserves and reductions in
      capital spending for exploration, development, and production;
      and 

- 

ability
      of our customers to timely pay the amounts due
  us. 

Customers 

      We depend
on a limited number of significant customers.  While none of these
customers represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period
presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of
operations. 

      Acquisitions,
dispositions, investments, and joint ventures 

      We
continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various
transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments,
or joint ventures.  These transactions are intended to result in the
realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or
income, or the reduction of risk.  Acquisition transactions may be
financed by additional borrowings or by the issuance of our common
stock.  These transactions may also affect our consolidated results of
operations. 

      These
transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that: 

- 

any
      acquisitions would result in an increase in
  income; 

- 

any
      acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and
      internal controls; 

- 

the
      due diligence prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could
      result in legal exposure or that we will appropriately quantify the
      exposure from known risks; 

- 

any
      disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash
      flow; 

- 

any
      dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not divert
      management resources; or 

- 

any
      dispositions, investments, acquisitions, or integrations would not have a
      material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
      condition. 

We
conduct some operations through joint ventures, where control may be shared with
unaffiliated third parties.  As with any joint venture arrangement,
differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed
decisions or in failures to agree on major issues.  We also cannot
control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance,
default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners.  These factors
could potentially materially and adversely affect the business and operations of
the joint venture and, in turn, our business and operations. 

      Environmental
requirements 

      Our
businesses are subject to a variety of environmental laws, rules, and
regulations in the United States and other countries, including those covering
hazardous materials and requiring emission performance standards for
facilities.  For example, our well service operations routinely
involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which
are classified as hazardous substances.  We also store, transport, and
use radioactive and explosive materials in certain of our
operations.  Environmental requirements include, for example, those
concerning: 

42 

- 

the
      containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste, and
      other waste materials; 

- 

the
      importation and use of radioactive
materials; 

- 

the
      use of underground storage tanks;
and 

- 

the
      use of underground injection wells. 

Environmental
and other similar requirements generally are becoming increasingly
strict.  Sanctions for failure to comply with these requirements, many
of which may be applied retroactively, may include: 

- 

administrative,
      civil, and criminal penalties; 

- 

revocation
      of permits to conduct business; and 

- 

corrective
      action orders, including orders to investigate and/or clean up
      contamination. 

Failure
on our part to comply with applicable environmental requirements could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.  We
are also exposed to costs arising from environmental compliance, including
compliance with changes in or expansion of environmental requirements, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
operating results, or cash flows. 

      We are
exposed to claims under environmental requirements and, from time to time, such
claims have been made against us.  In the United States, environmental
requirements and regulations typically impose strict
liability.  Strict liability means that in some situations we could be
exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other
damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or
the conduct of prior operators or other third parties.  Liability for
damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations. 

      We are
periodically notified of potential liabilities at state and federal superfund
sites.  These potential liabilities may arise from both historical
Halliburton operations and the historical operations of companies that we have
acquired.  Our exposure at these sites may be materially impacted by
unforeseen adverse developments both in the final remediation costs and with
respect to the final allocation among the various parties involved at the
sites.  For any particular federal or state superfund site, since our
estimated liability is typically within a range and our accrued liability may be
the amount on the low end of that range, our actual liability could eventually
be well in excess of the amount accrued.  The relevant regulatory
agency may bring suit against us for amounts in excess of what we have accrued
and what we believe is our proportionate share of remediation costs at any
superfund site.  We also could be subject to third-party claims,
including punitive damages, with respect to environmental matters for which we
have been named as a potentially responsible party. 

      Changes
in environmental requirements may negatively impact demand for our
services.  For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production
may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use
policies responsive to environmental concerns).  A decline in
exploration and production, in turn, could materially and adversely affect
us. 

      Law
and regulatory requirements 

      In the
countries in which we conduct business, we are subject to multiple and, at
times, inconsistent regulatory regimes, including those that govern our use of
radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals in the course of our
operations.  Various national and international regulatory regimes
govern the shipment of these items.  Many countries, but not all,
impose special controls upon the export and import of radioactive materials,
explosives, and chemicals.  Our ability to do business is subject to
maintaining required licenses and complying with these multiple regulatory
requirements applicable to these special products.  In addition, the
various laws governing import and export of both products and technology apply
to a wide range of services and products we offer.  In turn, this can
affect our employment practices of hiring people of different nationalities
because these laws may prohibit or limit access to some products or technology
by employees of various nationalities.  Changes in, compliance with,
or our failure to comply with these laws may negatively impact our ability to
provide services in, make sales of equipment to, and transfer personnel or
equipment among some of the countries in which we operate and could have a
material adverse affect on the results of operations. 

      Raw
materials 

      Raw
materials essential to our business are normally readily
available.  Current market conditions have triggered constraints in
the supply chain of certain raw materials, such as sand, cement, and specialty
metals.  The majority of our risk associated with the current supply
chain constraints occurs in those situations where we have a relationship with a
single supplier for a particular resource. 

43 

Intellectual
property rights 

      We rely
on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and
products.  We may not be able to successfully preserve these
intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be
invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.  In addition, the laws of
some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not
protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the
United States.  Our failure to protect our proprietary information and
any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings
against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive
position. 

      Technology 

      The
market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological
developments to provide better and more reliable performance and
services.  If we are not able to design, develop, and produce
commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive
services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business
and revenue could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our
intellectual property may be reduced.  Likewise, if our proprietary
technologies, equipment and facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we
may no longer be competitive, and our business and revenue could be materially
and adversely affected. 

      Reliance
on management 

      We depend
greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to
manage our operations.  The loss or unavailability of any of our
executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect
on our business. 

      Technical
personnel 

      Many of
the services that we provide and the products that we sell are complex and
highly engineered and often must perform or be performed in harsh
conditions.  We believe that our success depends upon our ability to
employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and
enhance these services and products.  In addition, our ability to
expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled
labor force.  The demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply
is limited.  A significant increase in the wages paid by competing
employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in
the wage rates that we must pay, or both.  If either of these events
were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease,
and our growth potential could be impaired. 

      Weather 

      Our
business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather,
particularly in the Gulf of Mexico where we have
operations.  Repercussions of severe weather conditions may
include: 

- 

evacuation
      of personnel and curtailment of
services; 

- 

weather-related
      damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of
      operations; 

- 

weather-related
      damage to our facilities and project work
sites; 

- 

inability
      to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules;
      and 

- 

loss
      of productivity. 

Because
demand for natural gas in the United States drives a significant amount of our
business, warmer than normal winters in the United States are detrimental to the
demand for our services to gas producers.

MANAGEMENT S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

The
management of Halliburton Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the
Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). 

      Internal
control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent
limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.  Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may
vary over time. 

      Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to
assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.  Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of
December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders 

      Halliburton
Company: 

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Halliburton Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

As
discussed in Notes 11, 12 and 15, respectively, to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its methods of accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes as of January 1, 2007, its method of accounting for stock-based
compensation plans as of January 1, 2006, and its method of accounting for
defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31, 2006,
respectively. 

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Halliburton Company s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 20, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders 

      Halliburton
Company: 

We have
audited Halliburton Company s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) .   Halliburton
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.    Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our
opinion, Halliburton Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  issued by COSO. 

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton
Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated
February 20, 2008   expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements .

COMPANY 

      Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note
1.  Description of Company and Significant Accounting
Policies 

      Description
of Company 

      Halliburton
Company s predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware in 1924.  We are one of the world s largest
oilfield services companies.  Our two business segments are the
Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation
segment.  We provide a comprehensive range of services and products
for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas around the
world. 

      Use
of estimates 

      Our
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, requiring us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect: 

- 

the
      reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
      assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements;
      and 

- 

the
      reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
      period. 

Ultimate
results could differ from those estimates. 

      Basis
of presentation 

      The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of
our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have
determined that we are the primary beneficiary.  All material
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.  Investments in
companies in which we have significant influence are accounted for using the
equity method.  If we do not have significant influence, we use the
cost method. 

      As the
result of realigning our products and services during the third quarter of 2007,
we are now reporting two business segments.  See Note 4 for further
information.  Additionally, KBR, Inc. (KBR), formerly a wholly owned
subsidiary, is reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements.  See Note 2 for additional
information.  All prior periods presented reflect these
changes. 

      Certain
other prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. 

      Revenue
recognition 

       Overall.   Our
services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts
with our customers that do not include right of return provisions or other
significant post-delivery obligations.  Our products are produced in a
standard manufacturing operation, even if produced to our customer s
specifications.  We recognize revenue from product sales when title
passes to the customer, the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership, and
collectibility is reasonably assured.  Service revenue, including
training and consulting services, is recognized when the services are rendered
and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Rates for services are
typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour, or similar
basis. 

       Software
sales.   Sales of perpetual software licenses, net of any
deferred maintenance and support fees, are recognized as revenue upon
shipment.  Sales of time-based licenses are recognized as revenue over
the license period.  Maintenance and support fees are recognized as
revenue ratably over the contract period, usually a one-year
duration. 

       Percentage of
completion.   Revenue from long-term contracts to provide well
construction and completion services is reported on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting.  Progress is generally based upon physical
progress related to contractually defined units of work.  Physical
percent complete is determined as a combination of input and output measures as
deemed appropriate by the circumstances.  All known or anticipated
losses on contracts are provided for when they become evident.  Cost
adjustments that are in the process of being negotiated with customers for extra
work or changes in the scope of work are included in revenue when collection is
deemed probable. 

      Sale
of stock by a subsidiary 

      When, as
part of a broader corporate reorganization, a subsidiary or affiliate sells
unissued shares in a public offering, we treat the transaction as a capital
transaction.  Therefore, the increase or decrease in the carrying
amount of our subsidiary s stock is not reflected as a gain or loss on our
consolidated statements of operations, but as an increase or decrease to
 Paid-in capital in excess of par value.  

52 

Research
and development 

      Research
and development expenses are charged to income as incurred.  Research
and development expenses were $301 million in 2007, $254 million in 2006, and
$218 million in 2005, of which over 97% was company-sponsored in each
year. 

      Software
development costs 

      Costs of
developing software for sale are charged to expense as research and development
when incurred until technological feasibility has been established for the
product.  Once technological feasibility is established, software
development costs are capitalized until the software is ready for general
release to customers.  We capitalized costs related to software
developed for resale of $23 million in 2007 and $21 million in both 2006 and
2005.  Amortization expense of software development costs was $17
million for 2007, $21 million for 2006, and $22 million for
2005.  Once the software is ready for release, amortization of
software development costs begins.  Capitalized software development
costs are amortized over periods not exceeding five years. 

      Cash
equivalents 

      We
consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents, except for cash equivalents of KBR, which are
reflected as current assets of discontinued operations at December 31,
2006. 

      Inventories 

      Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost represents invoice or
production cost for new items and original cost less allowance for condition for
used material returned to stock.  Production cost includes material,
labor, and manufacturing overhead.  Some domestic manufacturing and
field service finished products and parts inventories for drill bits, completion
products, and bulk materials are recorded using the last-in, first-out
method.  The remaining inventory is recorded on the average cost
method. 

      Allowance
for bad debts 

      We
establish an allowance for bad debts through a review of several factors,
including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer
accounts, and financial condition of our customers. 

      Property,
plant, and equipment 

      Other
than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to
impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated
depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.  Accelerated depreciation
methods are also used for tax purposes, wherever permitted.  Upon sale
or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.  Planned
major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. 

      Goodwill 

      The
reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis and more frequently when negative conditions such as
significant current or projected operating losses exist.  The annual
impairment test for goodwill is a two-step process and involves comparing the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit s carrying
value, including goodwill.  If the fair value of a reporting unit
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered
impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is
unnecessary.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed
to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.  Our
annual impairment tests resulted in no goodwill impairment in 2007, 2006, or
2005. 

      Evaluating
impairment of long-lived assets 

      When
events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than
goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed.  For an asset
classified as held for use, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to fair value is required.  When an asset is
classified as held for sale, the asset s book value is evaluated and adjusted to
the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  In
addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held
for sale. 

53 

Income
taxes 

      We
recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year.  In
addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial
statements or tax returns.  A valuation allowance is provided for
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be
realized. 

      In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment.  Based upon the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we
will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing
valuation allowances. 

      We
recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the
provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated
statements of operations. 

      We
generally do not provide income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be
reinvested indefinitely to finance foreign activities.  These
additional foreign earnings could be subject to additional tax if remitted, or
deemed remitted, as a dividend; however, it is not practicable to estimate the
additional amount, if any, of taxes payable.  Taxes are provided as
necessary with respect to earnings that are not permanently
reinvested. 

      Derivative
instruments 

      At times,
we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected
exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
commodity prices.  We do not enter into derivative transactions for
speculative or trading purposes.  We recognize all derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives are adjusted to fair value
and reflected through the results of operations.  Gains or losses on
foreign currency derivatives are included in other, net; gains or losses on
interest rate derivatives are included in interest expense; and gains or losses
on commodity derivatives are included in operating income.  Our
derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 

      Foreign
currency translation 

      Foreign
entities whose functional currency is the United States dollar translate
monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary
items are translated at historical rates.  Income and expense accounts
are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for
depreciation, cost of product sales and revenue, and expenses associated with
nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical
rates.  Gains or losses from changes in exchange rates are recognized
in consolidated income in the year of occurrence.  Foreign entities
whose functional currency is not the United States dollar translate net assets
at year-end rates and income and expense accounts at average exchange
rates.  Adjustments resulting from these translations are reflected in
the consolidated statements of shareholders  equity as cumulative translation
adjustments. 

54 

Stock-based
compensation 

      Effective
January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the
modified prospective application.  Accordingly, we are recognizing
compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified,
repurchased, or cancelled after January 1, 2006.  Compensation cost
for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of January 1, 2006
is being recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair
value at date of grant.  Also, beginning with the January 1, 2006
purchase period, compensation expense for our 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP) is being recognized.  The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle related to stock-based awards was
immaterial.  Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for these plans
under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related
interpretations.  Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was
recognized for stock options or the ESPP.  Compensation expense was
recognized for restricted stock awards.  As a result of adopting SFAS
No. 123(R), the incremental pretax expense related to employee stock option
awards and our ESPP totaled approximately $33 million in 2006 or $0.02 per
diluted share after tax on continuing operations.  The incremental
impact to net income related to employee stock option awards and our ESPP in
2006 totaled approximately $26 million. 

      Total
stock-based compensation expense for continuing operations, net of related tax
effects, was $62 million in 2007 and $49 million in 2006.  Total
income tax benefit recognized in continuing operations for stock-based
compensation arrangements was $35 million in 2007, $27 million in 2006, and $13
million in 2005.  Total incremental compensation cost resulting from
modifications of previously granted stock-based awards was $18 million in 2007,
$10 million in 2006, and $12 million in 2005.  These modifications
allowed certain employees to retain their awards after leaving the
company. 

      The
following table summarizes the pro forma effect on net income and income per
share for 2005 as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  to stock-based employee
compensation.

The fair
value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.  The expected volatility of options granted in
2007 and 2006 was a blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on
actively traded options on our common stock and upon the historical volatility
of our common stock.  The expected volatility of options granted in
2005 was based upon the historical volatility of our common
stock.  The expected term of options granted in 2007, 2006, and 2005
was based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of
grant and exercise of options for all employees.  The assumptions and
resulting fair values of options granted were as follows:

The fair
value of ESPP shares was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model.  The expected volatility was a one-year historical volatility
of our common stock.  The assumptions and resulting fair values were
as follows:

2.  KBR Separation 

      In
November 2006, KBR completed an initial public offering (IPO), in which it sold
approximately 32 million shares of KBR common stock at $17.00 per
share.  Proceeds from the IPO were approximately $508 million, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  The
increase in the carrying amount of our investment in KBR, resulting from the
IPO, was recorded in  Paid-in capital in excess of par value  on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006.  On April 5, 2007, we
completed the separation of KBR from us by exchanging the 135.6 million shares
of KBR common stock owned by us on that date for 85.3 million shares of our
common stock.  In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a gain on
the disposition of KBR of approximately $933 million, net of tax and the
estimated fair value of the indemnities and guarantees provided to KBR as
described below, which is included in income from discontinued operations on the
consolidated statement of operations. 

      The
following table presents the financial results of KBR, which are reflected as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of
operations.  For accounting purposes, we ceased including KBR s
operations in our results effective March 31, 2007. 

We
entered into various agreements relating to the separation of KBR, including,
among others, a master separation agreement, a registration rights agreement, a
tax sharing agreement, transition services agreements, and an employee matters
agreement.  The master separation agreement provides for, among other
things, KBR s responsibility for liabilities related to its business and
Halliburton s responsibility for liabilities unrelated to KBR s
business.  Halliburton provides indemnification in favor of KBR under
the master separation agreement for certain contingent liabilities, including
Halliburton s indemnification of KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned
subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006, the date of the master separation
agreement, for: 

57 

- 

fines
      or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages, including
      disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a governmental
      authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Nigeria,
      Switzerland, and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to alleged
      or actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the United
      States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or particular, analogous
      applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules, and regulations in connection
      with investigations pending as of that date, including with respect to the
      construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a natural gas
      liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers
      State, Nigeria; and 

- 

all
      out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses, or cash settlements or cash
      arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after the effective date
      of the master separation agreement as a result of the replacement of the
      subsea flowline bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
      project.  See Note 10 for further discussion of these
      matters. 

As a
result of these agreements, we recorded $190 million, as a reduction of the gain
on the disposition of KBR, to reflect the estimated fair value of the above
indemnities and guarantees, net of the associated estimated future tax
benefit.  The estimated fair value of these indemnities and guarantees
is primarily included in  Other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2007. 

      Additionally,
Halliburton provides indemnities, performance guarantees, surety bond
guarantees, and letter of credit guarantees that are currently in place in favor
of KBR s customers or lenders under project contract, credit agreements, letters
of credit, and other KBR credit instruments.  These indemnities and
guarantees will continue until they expire at the earlier of:  (1) the
termination of the underlying project contract or KBR obligations thereunder;
(2) the expiration of the relevant credit support instrument in accordance with
its terms or release of such instrument by the customer; or (3) the expiration
of the credit agreements.  Further, KBR and we have agreed that, until
December 31, 2009, we will issue additional guarantees, indemnification, and
reimbursement commitments for KBR s benefit in connection with: (a) letters of
credit necessary to comply with KBR s Egypt Basic Industries Corporation ammonia
plant contract, KBR s Allenby   Connaught project, and all other KBR project
contracts that were in place as of December 15, 2005; (b) surety bonds issued to
support new task orders pursuant to the Allenby   Connaught project, two job
order contracts for KBR s Government and Infrastructure segment, and all other
KBR project contracts that were in place as of December 15, 2005; and (c)
performance guarantees in support of these contracts.  KBR is
compensating Halliburton for these guarantees.  Halliburton has also
provided a limited indemnity, with respect to FCPA governmental and third-party
claims, to the lender parties under KBR s revolving credit agreement expiring in
December 2010.  KBR has agreed to indemnify Halliburton, other than
for the FCPA and Barracuda-Caratinga bolts matter, if Halliburton is required to
perform under any of the indemnities or guarantees related to KBR s revolving
credit agreement, letters of credit, surety bonds, or performance guarantees
described above. 

      The tax
sharing agreement provides for allocations of United States and certain other
jurisdiction tax liabilities between us and KBR.  Under the transition
services agreements, we continue to provide various interim corporate support
services to KBR, and KBR continues to provide various interim corporate support
services to us.  The fees are determined on a basis generally intended
to approximate the fully allocated direct and indirect costs of providing the
services, without any profit.  Under an employee matters agreement,
Halliburton and KBR have allocated liabilities and responsibilities related to
current and former employees and their participation in certain benefit
plans.  Among other items, the employee matters agreement provided for
the conversion, which occurred upon completion of the separation of KBR, of
stock options and restricted stock awards (with restrictions that had not yet
lapsed as of the final separation date) granted to KBR employees under our 1993
Stock and Incentive Plan (1993 Plan) to options and restricted stock awards
covering KBR common stock.  As of April 5, 2007, these awards
consisted of 1.2 million options with a weighted average exercise price per
share of $15.01 and approximately 600,000 restricted shares with a weighted
average grant-date fair value per share of $17.95 under our 1993
Plan.

3.  Acquisitions and Dispositions 

      PSL
Energy Services Limited 

      In July
2007, we acquired the entire share capital of PSL Energy Services Limited
(PSLES), an eastern hemisphere provider of process, pipeline, and well
intervention services.  PSLES has operational bases in the United
Kingdom, Norway, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Algeria, and Asia
Pacific.  We paid approximately $330 million for PSLES, consisting of
$326 million in cash and $4 million in debt assumed, subject to adjustment for
working capital purposes.  As of December 31, 2007, we had recorded
goodwill of $163 million and intangible assets of $54 million on a preliminary
basis until our analysis of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is complete.  Beginning in August 2007, PSLES s results of
operations are included in our Completion and Production segment. 

      Dresser,
Ltd. interest 

      As a part
of our sale of Dresser Equipment Group in 2001, we retained a small equity
interest in Dresser Inc. s Class A common stock.  Dresser Inc. was
later reorganized as Dresser, Ltd., and we exchanged our shares for shares of
Dresser, Ltd.  In May 2007, we sold our remaining interest in Dresser,
Ltd.  We received $70 million in cash from the sale and recorded a $49
million gain.  This investment was reflected in  Other assets  on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. 

      Ultraline
Services Corporation 

      In
January 2007, we acquired all intellectual property, current assets, and
existing business associated with Calgary-based Ultraline Services Corporation
(Ultraline), a division of Savanna Energy Services Corp.  Ultraline is
a provider of wireline services in Canada.  We paid approximately $178
million for Ultraline and recorded goodwill of $124 million and intangible
assets of $41 million.  Beginning in February 2007, Ultraline s
results of operations are included in our Drilling and Evaluation
segment. 

      Subsea
7, Inc. 

      In
January 2005, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in Subsea 7, Inc. to our
joint venture partner, Siem Offshore (formerly DSND Subsea ASA), for
approximately $200 million in cash.  As a result of the transaction,
we recorded a gain of approximately $110 million during the first quarter of
2005.  We accounted for our 50% ownership of Subsea 7, Inc. using the
equity method in our Completion and Production segment. 

Note
4.  Business Segment Information 

      Subsequent
to the KBR separation, in the third quarter of 2007, we realigned our products
and services to improve operational and cost management efficiencies, better
serve our customers, and become better aligned with the process of exploring for
and producing from oil and natural gas wells.  We now operate under
two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we now
report:  the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and
Evaluation segment.  All periods presented reflect reclassifications
related to the change in operating segments and the reclassification of certain
amounts between the operating segments and  Corporate and other.   The
two KBR segments have been reclassified as discontinued operations as a result
of the separation of KBR from us. 

      Following
is a discussion of our operating segments. 

       Completion and Production 
delivers cementing, stimulation, intervention, and completion
services.  This segment consists of production enhancement services,
completion tools and services, and cementing services. 

      Production
enhancement services include stimulation services, pipeline process services,
sand control services, and well intervention services.  Stimulation
services optimize oil and gas reservoir production through a variety of pressure
pumping services, nitrogen services, and chemical processes, commonly known as
hydraulic fracturing and acidizing.  Pipeline process services include
pipeline and facility testing, commissioning, and cleaning via pressure pumping,
chemical systems, specialty equipment, and nitrogen, which are provided to the
midstream and downstream sectors of the energy business.  Sand control
services include fluid and chemical systems and pumping services for the
prevention of formation sand production.  Well intervention services
enable live well intervention and continuous pipe deployment capabilities
through the use of hydraulic workover systems and coiled tubing tools and
services. 

59 

Completion
tools and services include subsurface safety valves and flow control equipment,
surface safety systems, packers and specialty completion equipment, intelligent
completion systems, expandable liner hanger systems, sand control systems, well
servicing tools, and reservoir performance services.  Reservoir
performance services include testing tools, real-time reservoir analysis, and
data acquisition services.  Additionally, completion tools and
services include WellDynamics, an intelligent well completions joint venture,
which we consolidate for accounting purposes. 

      Cementing
services involve bonding the well and well casing while isolating fluid zones
and maximizing wellbore stability.  Our cementing service line also
provides casing equipment. 

       Drilling and Evaluation 
provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, and precise
well-bore placement solutions that enable customers to model, measure, and
optimize their well construction activities.  This segment consists of
Baroid Fluid Services, Sperry Drilling Services, Security DBS Drill Bits,
wireline and perforating services, Landmark, and project
management. 

      Baroid
Fluid Services provides drilling fluid systems, performance additives,
completion fluids, solids control, specialized testing equipment, and waste
management services for oil and gas drilling, completion, and workover
operations. 

      Sperry
Drilling Services provides drilling systems and services.  These
services include directional and horizontal drilling,
measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface data logging,
multilateral systems, underbalanced applications, and rig site information
systems.  Our drilling systems offer directional control while
providing important measurements about the characteristics of the drill string
and geological formations while drilling directional wells.  Real-time
operating capabilities enable the monitoring of well progress and aid
decision-making processes. 

      Security
DBS Drill Bits provides roller cone rock bits, fixed cutter bits, hole
enlargement and related downhole tools and services used in drilling oil and gas
wells.  In addition, coring equipment and services are provided to
acquire cores of the formation drilled for evaluation. 

      Wireline
and perforating services include open-hole wireline services that provide
information on formation evaluation, including resistivity, porosity, and
density, rock mechanics, and fluid sampling.  Also offered are
cased-hole and slickline services, which provide cement bond evaluation,
reservoir monitoring, pipe evaluation, pipe recovery, mechanical services, well
intervention, and perforating.  Perforating services include
tubing-conveyed perforating services and products. 

      Landmark
is a supplier of integrated exploration, drilling, and production software
information systems, as well as consulting and data management services for the
upstream oil and gas industry. 

      The
Drilling and Evaluation segment also provides oilfield project management and
integrated solutions to independent, integrated, and national oil
companies.  These offerings make use of all of our oilfield services,
products, technologies, and project management capabilities to assist our
customers in optimizing the value of their oil and gas assets. 

       Corporate and other  includes
expenses related to support functions and corporate executives.  Also
included are certain gains and losses that are not attributable to a particular
business segment.   Corporate and other  represents assets not
included in a business segment and is primarily composed of cash and
equivalents, deferred tax assets, and marketable securities. 

      Intersegment
revenue and revenue between geographic areas are immaterial.  Our
equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted
for on the equity method is included in revenue and operating income of the
applicable segment. 

60 

The
following tables present information on our business segments. 

Not all
assets are associated with specific segments.  Those assets specific
to segments include receivables, inventories, certain identified property,
plant, and equipment (including field service equipment), equity in and advances
to related companies, and goodwill.  The remaining assets, such as
cash, are considered to be shared among the segments. 

      Revenue
by country is determined based on the location of services provided and products
sold. 

61 

Note
5.  Receivables 

      Our trade
receivables are generally not collateralized.  At December 31, 2007,
35% of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the United
States.  As of December 31, 2006, 39% of our gross trade receivables
were from customers in the United States.  No other country accounted
for more than 10% of our gross trade receivables at these dates. 

Note
6.  Inventories 

      Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market.  In the United States we
manufacture certain finished products and parts inventories for drill bits,
completion products, bulk materials, and other tools that are recorded using the
last-in, first-out method, which totaled $71 million at December 31, 2007 and
$58 million at December 31, 2006.  If the average cost method had been
used, total inventories would have been $25 million higher than reported at
December 31, 2007 and $20 million higher than reported at December 31,
2006.  The cost of the remaining inventory was recorded on the average
cost method.  Inventories consisted of the following: 

Finished
products and parts are reported net of obsolescence reserves of $65 million at
December 31, 2007 and $63 million at December 31, 2006. 

Note
7.  Investments 

      Investments
in marketable securities 

      At
December 31, 2007, we had $388 million invested in marketable securities,
consisting of auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand notes which were
classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value.  In
January 2008, we sold the entire balance of marketable securities at face
value.  At December 31, 2006, our investments in marketable securities
were $20 million. 

      Restricted
cash 

      At
December 31, 2007, we had restricted cash of $52 million, which primarily
consisted of collateral for potential future insurance claim reimbursements,
included in  Other assets.   At December 31, 2006, we had restricted
cash of $108 million in  Other assets,  which primarily consisted of similar
items.  The $56 million decrease in restricted cash primarily reflects
the release, due to the separation of KBR, of collateral related to potential
insurance claim reimbursements. 

62 

Note
8.  Property, Plant, and Equipment 

      Property,
plant, and equipment were composed of the following: 

The
percentages of total buildings and property improvements and total machinery,
equipment, and other, excluding oil and gas investments, are depreciated over
the following useful lives: 

Note
9.  Debt 

      Short-term
notes payable consist primarily of overdraft and other facilities with varying
rates of interest.  Long-term debt consisted of the
following: 

Convertible
notes 

      In June
2003, we issued $1.2 billion of 3.125% convertible senior notes due July 15,
2023, with interest payable semiannually.  The notes are our senior
unsecured obligations ranking equally with all of our existing and future senior
unsecured indebtedness. 

63 

The notes
are convertible under any of the following circumstances: 

- 

during
      any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock
      for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading
      days ending on the last trading day of the previous quarter is greater
      than or equal to 120% of the conversion price per share of our common
      stock on such last trading day; 

- 

if
      the notes have been called for
redemption; 

- 

upon
      the occurrence of specified corporate transactions that are described in
      the indenture governing the notes;
or 

- 

during
      any period in which the credit ratings assigned to the notes by both
      Moody s Investors Service and Standard   Poor s are lower than Ba1 and
      BB+, respectively, or the notes are no longer rated by at least one of
      these rating services or their
successors. 

The
conversion price is $18.825 per share and is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of stock dividends in common stock, the issuance of rights or
warrants, stock splits and combinations, the distribution of indebtedness,
securities, or assets, or excess cash distributions.  The stock
conversion rate for the notes changed as a result of our July 2006 stock split
and periodic increases to our quarterly dividend.  The maximum stock
conversion rate is 87.6424 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
notes.  As of December 31, 2007, the stock conversion rate was 53.3383
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. 

      Subsequent
to issuing the notes, we agreed upon conversion to settle the principal amount
of the notes in cash.  For any amounts in excess of the aggregate
principal amount we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock, cash,
or a combination of cash and common stock.  See Note 13 for discussion
of the impact on diluted earnings per share. 

      The notes
are redeemable for cash at our option on or after July 15,
2008.  Holders may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on July
15 of 2008, 2013, or 2018 or, prior to July 15, 2008, in the event of a
fundamental change as defined in the underlying indenture. 

      Other
senior debt 

      We have
issued various senior notes, medium-term notes, and debentures, all of which
rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness.  Our senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of
$750 million will mature in October 2010 and bear interest at a rate equal to
5.5%, payable semiannually.  They are redeemable by us, in whole or in
part, at any time, subject to a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of
the principal amount of the notes or the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the notes
discounted to the redemption date at the treasury rate plus 25 basis
points.  The senior notes were initially offered on a discounted basis
at 99.679% of their face value.  The discount is being amortized to
interest expense over the life of the notes. 

      We have
outstanding notes under our medium-term note program, including $150 million
that will mature in December 2008 and bear interest at a rate equal to 5.63%,
payable semiannually.  They are redeemable by us, in whole or in part,
at any time, subject to a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the notes discounted to the
redemption date at the treasury rate plus 15 basis points.  In
addition, we have notes issued under the medium-term note program with a
principal amount of $45 million that mature in May 2017 and notes with a
principal amount of $104 million that mature in February 2027, which bear
interest rates equal to 7.53% and 6.75%, respectively, payable
semiannually.  The 7.53% and 6.75% notes may not be redeemed prior to
maturity.  The medium-term notes do not have sinking fund
requirements. 

      We have
outstanding debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $185 million that
will mature in February 2021 and bear interest at a rate equal to 8.75%, payable
semiannually.  In addition, we have outstanding debentures with an
aggregate principal amount of $294 million that will mature in August 2096 and
bear interest at a rate equal to 7.6%, payable semiannually.  The
debentures may not be redeemed prior to maturity and do not have sinking fund
requirements. 

64 

Revolving
credit facilities 

      On July
9, 2007, we entered into a new unsecured $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit
facility that replaced our then existing unsecured $1.2 billion five-year
revolving credit facility with generally similar terms and conditions except
that the new facility does not contain any financial covenants.  The
purpose of the facility is to provide commercial paper support, general working
capital, and credit for other corporate purposes.  There were no cash
drawings under the revolving credit facility as of December 31,
2007. 

      Maturities 

      Our debt
matures as follows:  $159 million in 2008; $12 million in 2009; $755
million in 2010; $3 million in 2011; $3 million in 2012; and $1.9 billion
thereafter. 

Note
10.  Commitments and Contingencies 

      Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act investigations 

      The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting a formal investigation
into whether improper payments were made to government officials in Nigeria
through the use of agents or subcontractors in connection with the construction
and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a multibillion dollar natural gas
liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
Nigeria.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) is also conducting a related
criminal investigation.  The SEC has also issued subpoenas seeking
information, which we and KBR are furnishing, regarding current and former
agents used in connection with multiple projects, including current and prior
projects, over the past 20 years located both in and outside of Nigeria in which
the Halliburton energy services business, KBR or affiliates, subsidiaries or
joint ventures of Halliburton or KBR, are or were participants.  In
September 2006 and October 2007, the SEC and the DOJ, respectively, each
requested that we enter into an agreement to extend the statute of limitations
with respect to its investigation.  We anticipate that we will enter
into appropriate tolling agreements with the SEC and the DOJ. 

      TSKJ is a
private limited liability company registered in Madeira, Portugal whose members
are Technip SA of France, Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem
SpA of Italy), JGC Corporation of Japan, and Kellogg Brown   Root LLC (a
subsidiary of KBR), each of which had an approximate 25% interest in the
venture.  TSKJ and other similarly owned entities entered into various
contracts to build and expand the liquefied natural gas project for Nigeria LNG
Limited, which is owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Shell
Gas B.V., Cleag Limited (an affiliate of Total), and Agip International B.V. (an
affiliate of ENI SpA of Italy). 

      The SEC
and the DOJ have been reviewing these matters in light of the requirements of
the FCPA.  In addition to performing our own investigation, we have
been cooperating with the SEC and the DOJ investigations and with other
investigations in France, Nigeria, and Switzerland regarding the Bonny Island
project.  The government of Nigeria gave notice in 2004 to the French
magistrate of a civil claim as an injured party in the French
investigation.  We also believe that the Serious Fraud Office in the
United Kingdom is conducting an investigation relating to the Bonny Island
project.  Our Board of Directors has appointed a committee of
independent directors to oversee and direct the FCPA
investigations. 

      The
matters under investigation relating to the Bonny Island project cover an
extended period of time (in some cases significantly before our 1998 acquisition
of Dresser Industries and continuing through the current time
period).  We have produced documents to the SEC and the DOJ from the
files of numerous officers and employees of Halliburton and KBR, including
current and former executives of Halliburton and KBR, both voluntarily and
pursuant to company subpoenas from the SEC and a grand jury, and we are making
our employees and we understand KBR is making its employees available to the SEC
and the DOJ for interviews.  In addition, the SEC has issued a
subpoena to A. Jack Stanley, who formerly served as a consultant and chairman of
Kellogg Brown   Root LLC, and to others, including certain of our and KBR s
current or former executive officers or employees, and at least one
subcontractor of KBR.  We further understand that the DOJ has issued
subpoenas for the purpose of obtaining information abroad, and we understand
that other partners in TSKJ have provided information to the DOJ and the SEC
with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
subpoenas. 

65 

The SEC
and DOJ investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ s engagements of
Tri-Star Investments as an agent and a Japanese trading company as a
subcontractor to provide services to TSKJ were utilized to make improper
payments to Nigerian government officials.  In connection with the
Bonny Island project, TSKJ entered into a series of agency agreements, including
with Tri-Star Investments, of which Jeffrey Tesler is a principal, commencing in
1995 and a series of subcontracts with a Japanese trading company commencing in
1996.  We understand that a French magistrate has officially placed
Mr. Tesler under investigation for corruption of a foreign public
official.  In Nigeria, a legislative committee of the National
Assembly and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is organized as
part of the executive branch of the government, are also investigating these
matters.  Our representatives have met with the French magistrate and
Nigerian officials.  In October 2004, representatives of TSKJ
voluntarily testified before the Nigerian legislative committee. 

      TSKJ
suspended the receipt of services from and payments to Tri-Star Investments and
the Japanese trading company and has considered instituting legal proceedings to
declare all agency agreements with Tri-Star Investments terminated and to
recover all amounts previously paid under those agreements.  In
February 2005, TSKJ notified the Attorney General of Nigeria that TSKJ would not
oppose the Attorney General s efforts to have sums of money held on deposit in
accounts of Tri-Star Investments in banks in Switzerland transferred to Nigeria
and to have the legal ownership of such sums determined in the Nigerian
courts. 

      As a
result of these investigations, information has been uncovered suggesting that,
commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian
officials.  We have reason to believe that, based on the ongoing
investigations, payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian
officials.  In addition, information uncovered in the summer of 2006
suggests that, prior to 1998, plans may have been made by employees of The M.W.
Kellogg Company (a predecessor of a KBR subsidiary) to make payments to
government officials in connection with the pursuit of a number of other
projects in countries outside of Nigeria.  We are reviewing a number
of more recently discovered documents related to KBR s activities in countries
outside of Nigeria with respect to agents for projects after
1998.  Certain activities discussed in this paragraph involve current
or former employees or persons who were or are consultants to KBR, and our
investigation is continuing. 

      In June
2004, all relationships with Mr. Stanley and another consultant and former
employee of M.W. Kellogg Limited were terminated.  The terminations
occurred because of Code of Business Conduct violations that allegedly involved
the receipt of improper personal benefits from Mr. Tesler in connection with
TSKJ s construction of the Bonny Island project. 

      In 2006
and 2007, KBR suspended the services of other agents in and outside of Nigeria,
including one agent who, until such suspension, had worked for KBR outside of
Nigeria on several current projects and on numerous older projects going back to
the early 1980s.  Such suspensions have occurred when possible
improper conduct has been discovered or alleged or when Halliburton and KBR have
been unable to confirm the agent s compliance with applicable law and the Code
of Business Conduct. 

      The SEC
and DOJ are also investigating and have issued subpoenas concerning TSKJ's use
of an immigration services provider, apparently managed by a Nigerian
immigration official, to which approximately $1.8 million in payments in excess
of costs of visas were allegedly made between approximately 1997 and the
termination of the provider in December 2004.  We understand that TSKJ
terminated the immigration services provider after a KBR employee discovered the
issue.  We reported this matter to the United States government in
2007.  The SEC has issued a subpoena requesting documents among other
things concerning any payment of anything of value to Nigerian government
officials.  In response to such subpoena, we have produced and
continue to produce additional documents regarding KBR and Halliburton s energy
services business use of immigration and customs service providers, which may
result in further inquiries.  Furthermore, as a result of these
matters, we have expanded our own investigation to consider any matters raised
by energy services activities in Nigeria. 

66 

If
violations of the FCPA were found, a person or entity found in violation could
be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation, equitable
remedies, including disgorgement (if applicable) generally of profits, including
prejudgment interest on such profits, causally connected to the violation, and
injunctive relief.  Criminal penalties could range up to the greater
of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the
violation, which could be substantially greater than $2 million per
violation.  It is possible that both the SEC and the DOJ could assert
that there have been multiple violations, which could lead to multiple
fines.  The amount of any fines or monetary penalties that could be
assessed would depend on, among other factors, the findings regarding the
amount, timing, nature, and scope of any improper payments, whether any such
payments were authorized by or made with knowledge of us, KBR or our or KBR s
affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss involved, and the level
of cooperation provided the government authorities during the
investigations.  The government has expressed concern regarding the
level of our cooperation.  Agreed dispositions of these types of
violations also frequently result in an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the
entity and the appointment of a monitor on terms negotiated with the SEC and the
DOJ to review and monitor current and future business practices, including the
retention of agents, with the goal of assuring compliance with the
FCPA. 

      These
investigations could also result in third-party claims against us, which may
include claims for special, indirect, derivative or consequential damages,
damage to our business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow,
assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or business
value or claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors,
attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of us
or our current or former subsidiaries.  In addition, we could incur
costs and expenses for any monitor required by or agreed to with a governmental
authority to review our continued compliance with FCPA law. 

      As of
December 31, 2007, we are unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or a
range of possible loss related to these matters as it relates to Halliburton
directly.  However, we provided indemnification in favor of KBR under
the master separation agreement for certain contingent liabilities, including
Halliburton s indemnification of KBR and any of its greater than 50%-owned
subsidiaries as of November 20, 2006, the date of the master separation
agreement, for fines or other monetary penalties or direct monetary damages,
including disgorgement, as a result of a claim made or assessed by a
governmental authority in the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Nigeria, Switzerland, and/or Algeria, or a settlement thereof, related to
alleged or actual violations occurring prior to November 20, 2006 of the FCPA or
particular, analogous applicable foreign statutes, laws, rules, and regulations
in connection with investigations pending as of that date, including with
respect to the construction and subsequent expansion by TSKJ of a natural gas
liquefaction complex and related facilities at Bonny Island in Rivers State,
Nigeria.  We recorded the estimated fair market value of this
indemnity regarding FCPA matters described above upon our separation from
KBR.  See Note 2 for additional information. 

      Our
indemnification obligation to KBR does not include losses resulting from
third-party claims against KBR, including claims for special, indirect,
derivative or consequential damages, nor does our indemnification apply to
damage to KBR s business or reputation, loss of, or adverse effect on, cash
flow, assets, goodwill, results of operations, business prospects, profits or
business value or claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders, or other interest holders or
constituents of KBR or KBR s current or former subsidiaries. 

      In
consideration of our agreement to indemnify KBR for the liabilities referred to
above, KBR has agreed that we will at all times, in our sole discretion, have
and maintain control over the investigation, defense and/or settlement of these
FCPA matters until such time, if any, that KBR exercises its right to assume
control of the investigation, defense and/or settlement of the FCPA matters as
it relates to KBR.  KBR has also agreed, at our expense, to assist
with Halliburton s full cooperation with any governmental authority in our
investigation of these FCPA matters and our investigation, defense and/or
settlement of any claim made by a governmental authority or court relating to
these FCPA matters, in each case even if KBR assumes control of these FCPA
matters as it relates to KBR.  If KBR takes control over the
investigation, defense, and/or settlement of FCPA matters, refuses a settlement
of FCPA matters negotiated by us, enters into a settlement of FCPA matters
without our consent, or materially breaches its obligation to cooperate with
respect to our investigation, defense, and/or settlement of FCPA matters, we may
terminate the indemnity. 

67 

Barracuda-Caratinga
arbitration 

      We also
provided indemnification in favor of KBR under the master separation agreement
for all out-of-pocket cash costs and expenses (except for legal fees and other
expenses of the arbitration so long as KBR controls and directs it), or cash
settlements or cash arbitration awards in lieu thereof, KBR may incur after
November 20, 2006 as a result of the replacement of certain subsea flowline
bolts installed in connection with the Barracuda-Caratinga
project.  Under the master separation agreement, KBR currently
controls the defense, counterclaim, and settlement of the subsea flowline bolts
matter.  As a condition of our indemnity, for any settlement to be
binding upon us, KBR must secure our prior written consent to such settlement s
terms.  We have the right to terminate the indemnity in the event KBR
enters into any settlement without our prior written consent.  See
Note 2 for additional information regarding the KBR
indemnification. 

      At
Petrobras  direction, KBR replaced certain bolts located on the subsea flowlines
that failed through mid-November 2005, and KBR has informed us that additional
bolts have failed thereafter, which were replaced by Petrobras.  These
failed bolts were identified by Petrobras when it conducted inspections of the
bolts.  A key issue in the arbitration is which party is responsible
for the designation of the material to be used for the bolts.  We
understand that KBR believes that an instruction to use the particular bolts was
issued by Petrobras, and as such, KBR believes the cost resulting from any
replacement is not KBR s responsibility.  We understand Petrobras
disagrees.  We understand KBR believes several possible solutions may
exist, including replacement of the bolts.  Estimates indicate that
costs of these various solutions range up to $140 million.  In March
2006, Petrobras commenced arbitration against KBR claiming $220 million plus
interest for the cost of monitoring and replacing the defective bolts and all
related costs and expenses of the arbitration, including the cost of attorneys 
fees.  We understand KBR is vigorously defending and pursuing recovery
of the costs incurred to date through the arbitration process and to that end
has submitted a counterclaim in the arbitration seeking the recovery of $22
million.  The arbitration panel has set an evidentiary hearing in
April 2008. 

      Securities
and related litigation 

      In June
2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against us in federal court alleging
violations of the federal securities laws after the SEC initiated an
investigation in connection with our change in accounting for revenue on
long-term construction projects and related disclosures.  In the weeks
that followed, approximately twenty similar class actions were filed against
us.  Several of those lawsuits also named as defendants several of our
present or former officers and directors.  The class action cases were
later consolidated, and the amended consolidated class action complaint, styled
 Richard Moore, et al. v.
Halliburton Company, et al.,  was filed and served upon us in April
2003.  As a result of a substitution of lead plaintiffs, the case is
now styled  Archdiocese of
Milwaukee Supporting Fund ( AMSF ) v. Halliburton Company, et
al.   We settled with the SEC in the second quarter of
2004. 

      In early
May 2003, we entered into a written memorandum of understanding setting forth
the terms upon which the  Moore  class action would be
settled.  In June 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a motion for leave
to file a second amended consolidated complaint, which was granted by the
court.  In addition to restating the original accounting and
disclosure claims, the second amended consolidated complaint included claims
arising out of the 1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries, Inc. by Halliburton,
including that we failed to timely disclose the resulting asbestos liability
exposure (the  Dresser claims ).  The memorandum of understanding
contemplated settlement of the Dresser claims as well as the original
claims. 

      In June
2004, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the
settlement.  Following the transfer of the case to another district
judge, the court held that evidence of the settlement s fairness was inadequate,
denied the motion for final approval of the settlement, and ordered the parties
to mediate.  The mediation was unsuccessful. 

68 

In April
2005, the court appointed new co-lead counsel and named AMSF the new lead
plaintiff, directing that it file a third consolidated amended complaint and
that we file our motion to dismiss.  The court held oral arguments on
that motion in August 2005, at which time the court took the motion under
advisement.  In March 2006, the court entered an order in which it
granted the motion to dismiss with respect to claims arising prior to June 1999
and granted the motion with respect to certain other claims while permitting
AMSF to re-plead some of those claims to correct deficiencies in its earlier
complaint.  In April 2006, AMSF filed its fourth amended consolidated
complaint.  We filed a motion to dismiss those portions of the
complaint that had been re-pled.  A hearing was held on that motion in
July 2006, and in March 2007 the court ordered dismissal of the claims against
all individual defendants other than our CEO.  The court ordered that
the case proceed against our CEO and Halliburton.  In response to a
motion by the lead plaintiff, on February 26, 2007, the court ordered the
removal and replacement of their co-lead counsel.  In June 2007, upon
becoming aware of a United States Supreme Court opinion issued in that month,
the court allowed further briefing on the motion to dismiss filed on behalf of
our CEO.  That briefing is complete, but the court has not yet
ruled.  In September 2007, AMSF filed a motion for class
certification, and our response was filed in November 2007.  The case
is set for trial in July 2009. 

      As of
December 31, 2007, we had not accrued any amounts related to this matter because
we do not believe that a loss is probable.  Further, an estimate of
possible loss or range of loss related to this matter cannot be
made. 

      Asbestos
insurance settlements 

      At
December 31, 2004, we resolved all open and future asbestos- and silica-related
claims in the prepackaged Chapter 11 proceedings of DII Industries LLC, Kellogg
Brown   Root LLC, and our other affected subsidiaries that had previously
been named as defendants in a large number of asbestos- and silica-related
lawsuits.  During 2004, we settled insurance disputes with
substantially all the insurance companies for asbestos- and silica-related
claims and all other claims under the applicable insurance policies and
terminated all the applicable insurance policies. 

      Under the
insurance settlements entered into as part of the resolution of our Chapter 11
proceedings, we have agreed to indemnify our insurers under certain historic
general liability insurance policies in certain situations.  We have
concluded that the likelihood of any claims triggering the indemnity obligations
is remote, and we believe any potential liability for these indemnifications
will be immaterial.  Further, an estimate of possible loss or range of
loss related to this matter cannot be made.  At December 31, 2007, we
had not recorded any liability associated with these
indemnifications. 

      M-I,
LLC antitrust litigation 

      On
February 16, 2007, we were informed that M-I, LLC, a competitor of ours in the
drilling fluids market, had sued us for allegedly attempting to monopolize the
market for invert emulsion drilling fluids used in deep water and/or in cold
water temperatures.  The claims M-I, LLC asserted are based upon its
allegation that the patent issued for our Accolade  drilling fluid was invalid
as a result of its allegedly having been procured by fraud on the United States
Patent and Trademark Office and that our subsequent prosecution of an
infringement action against M-I, LLC amounted to predatory conduct in violation
of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  In October 2006, a federal
court dismissed our infringement action based upon its holding that the claims
in our patent were indefinite and the patent was, therefore,
invalid.  That judgment was affirmed by the appellate court in January
2008.  M-I, LLC also alleges that we falsely advertised our Accolade 
drilling fluid in violation of the Lanham Act and California law and that our
earlier infringement action amounted to malicious prosecution in violation of
Texas state law.  M-I, LLC seeks compensatory damages, which it claims
should be trebled, as well as punitive damages and injunctive
relief.  We believe that M-I, LLC s claims are without merit and
intend to aggressively defend them.  The case is set for trial in
September 2008. 

      As of
December 31, 2007, we had not accrued any amounts in connection with this matter
because we do not believe that a loss is probable.  Further, an
estimate of possible loss or range of loss related to this matter cannot be
made. 

69 

Dirt,
Inc. litigation 

      In April
2005, Dirt, Inc. brought suit in Alabama against Bredero-Shaw (a joint venture
in which we formerly held a 50% interest that we sold to the other party in the
venture, ShawCor Ltd., in 2002), Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and ShawCor
Ltd., claiming that Bredero-Shaw disposed of hazardous waste in a construction
materials landfill owned and operated by Dirt, Inc.  Bredero-Shaw has
offered to take responsibility for cleanup of the site.  The plaintiff
did not accept that offer, and the method and cost of such cleanup are disputed,
with expert opinions ranging from $6 million to $144 million.  On
November 1, 2007, the trial court in the above-referenced matter entered a
judgment in the total amount of $108 million, of which Halliburton Energy
Services, Inc. could be responsible for as much as 50%.  We are
pursuing an appeal and believe that it is probable that the Alabama Supreme
Court will reverse the trial court s judgment because, among other
things: 

- 

the
      trial court misapplied the law on the measure of
  damages; 

- 

Halliburton
      Energy Services, Inc., as a shareholder, should not have liability for
      actions of the venture; and 

- 

the
      statute of limitations had run on an issue submitted to the
      jury. 

We have
accrued an amount less than $10 million, which represents our 50% portion of
what we believe it will cost to remediate the site. 

      Environmental 

      We are
subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related to
our operations worldwide.  In the United States, these laws and
regulations include, among others: 

- 

the
      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
      Act; 

- 

the
      Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act; 

- 

the
      Clean Air Act; 

- 

the
      Federal Water Pollution Control Act;
and 

- 

the
      Toxic Substances Control Act. 

In
addition to the federal laws and regulations, states and other countries where
we do business often have numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory
requirements by which we must abide.  We evaluate and address the
environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated
properties in order to avoid future liabilities and comply with environmental,
legal, and regulatory requirements.  On occasion, we are involved in
specific environmental litigation and claims, including the remediation of
properties we own or have operated, as well as efforts to meet or correct
compliance-related matters.  Our Health, Safety and Environment group
has several programs in place to maintain environmental leadership and to
prevent the occurrence of environmental contamination. 

      We do not
expect costs related to these remediation requirements to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
operations.  Our accrued liabilities for environmental matters were
$72 million as of December 31, 2007 and $39 million as of December 31,
2006.  Our total liability related to environmental matters covers
numerous properties, including the property in regard to which Dirt, Inc. has
brought suit against Bredero-Shaw (a joint venture in which we formerly held a
50% interest that we sold to the other party in the venture, ShawCor Ltd., in
2002), Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and ShawCor Ltd.  See  Dirt,
Inc. litigation  in this note for further information regarding this
matter. 

      We have
subsidiaries that have been named as potentially responsible parties along with
other third parties for 9 federal and state superfund sites for which we have
established a liability.  As of December 31, 2007, those 9 sites
accounted for approximately $10 million of our total $72 million
liability.  For any particular federal or state superfund site, since
our estimated liability is typically within a range and our accrued liability
may be the amount on the low end of that range, our actual liability could
eventually be well in excess of the amount accrued.  Despite attempts
to resolve these superfund matters, the relevant regulatory agency may at any
time bring suit against us for amounts in excess of the amount
accrued.  With respect to some superfund sites, we have been named a
potentially responsible party by a regulatory agency; however, in each of those
cases, we do not believe we have any material liability.  We also
could be subject to third-party claims with respect to environmental matters for
which we have been named as a potentially responsible party. 

70 

Letters
of credit 

      In the
normal course of business, we have agreements with banks under which
approximately $2.2 billion of letters of credit, surety bonds, or bank
guarantees were outstanding as of December 31, 2007, including $1.1 billion that
relate to KBR.  These KBR letters of credit, surety bonds, or bank
guarantees are being guaranteed by us in favor of KBR s customers and
lenders.  KBR has agreed to compensate us for these guarantees and
indemnify us if we are required to perform under any of these
guarantees.  Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering
events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. 

      Leases 

      We are
obligated under operating leases, principally for the use of land, offices,
equipment, manufacturing and field facilities, and warehouses.  Total
rentals, net of sublease rentals, were $487 million in 2007, $402 million in
2006, and $338 million in 2005. 

      Future
total rentals on noncancelable operating leases are as follows:  $180
million in 2008; $131 million in 2009; $104 million in 2010; $74 million in
2011; $40 million in 2012; and $172 million thereafter. 

Note
11.  Income Taxes 

      The
components of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations
were: 

The
United States and foreign components of income from continuing operations before
income taxes and minority interest were as follows: 

71 

Reconciliations
between the actual provision for income taxes on continuing operations and that
computed by applying the United States statutory rate to income from continuing
operations before income taxes and minority interest were as
follows: 

The major
component of the difference between the 2007 statutory rate compared to the
effective rate is the favorable impact of the ability to recognize United States
foreign tax credits of approximately $205 million.  This amount
consists of approximately $68 million of a change in valuation allowance for
credits previously recognized and approximately $137 million reflected in other
impact of foreign operations for changes to United States tax filings to claim
foreign tax credits rather than deducting foreign taxes.  We now
believe we can utilize these credits currently because we have generated
additional taxable income and expect to continue to generate a higher level of
taxable income largely from the growth of our international
operations.  The major component of the difference between the 2005
statutory tax rate compared to the effective tax rate is the release of a
valuation allowance for future tax attributes related to United States net
operating losses established in prior years.  The remaining valuation
allowance on future tax attributes related to United States net operating loss
was released in 2006.  The primary components of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowances were as
follows: 

72 

At
December 31, 2007, we had a total of $58 million of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, of which $31 million will expire from 2008 through 2020 and $27
million will not expire due to indefinite expiration dates.  At
December 31, 2007, we had $27 million of domestic net operating loss
carryforwards that will expire from 2021 through 2023 related to a consolidated
joint venture.  During 2005, our existing deferred tax asset related
to asbestos and silica liabilities became a United States net operating loss due
to the tax deduction of the related costs in 2005.  As a result, a
domestic net operating loss carryforward of $2.1 billion was created and was
fully utilized in 2006.  At December 31, 2007, we had United States
foreign tax credit carryforwards of $61 million that are expected to expire in
2016.  The federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards are
available to reduce future United States federal income taxes on an indefinite
basis. 

      We
established a valuation allowance on certain domestic and foreign operating loss
carryforwards on the basis that we believe these assets will not be utilized in
the statutory carryover period. 

      Effective
January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.   FIN 48, as amended May
2007 by FASB Staff Position FIN 48-1,  Definition of  Settlement  in FASB
Interpretation No. 48,  prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and
measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements.  It also provides guidance for derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. 

      As a
result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a decrease of $4 million in
other liabilities to account for a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits and an
increase of $34 million for accrued interest and penalties, which were accounted
for as a net reduction of $30 million to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings.  Of the $30 million reduction to retained earnings, $10
million was attributable to KBR, which is now reported as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements. 

73 

The
following presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits and associated
interest and penalties. 

At
December 31, 2007, $99 million of tax benefits associated with United States
foreign tax credits was included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits
that could be resolved within the next 12 months.  A review of foreign
tax documentation is currently underway and will likely be significantly
progressed within the next 12 months.  Also, as of December 31, 2007,
a significant portion of our non-United States unrecognized tax benefits, while
not individually significant, could be settled within the next 12
months.  As of December 31, 2007, we estimated that $289 million of
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, if resolved in our favor, would
positively impact the effective tax rate and, therefore, be recognized as
additional tax benefits in our statement of operations.  We file
income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various
states and foreign jurisdictions.  In most cases, we are no longer
subject to United States federal, state, and local, or non-United States income
tax examination by tax authorities for years before 1998.  Tax filings
of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates, and related entities are
routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax
authorities.  Currently, our United States federal tax filings are
under review for tax years 2000 through 2005.  An unrecognized tax
benefit of $6 million related to the 2000 through 2002 tax years could be
resolved within the next 12 months. 

74 

Note
12.  Shareholders  Equity and Stock Incentive Plans 

      The
following tables summarize our common stock and other shareholders  equity
activity: 

75 

76 

In May
2006, the shareholders increased the number of authorized shares of common stock
to two billion.  Also in May 2006, our Board of Directors finalized
the terms of a two-for-one common stock split, effected in the form of a stock
dividend.  As a result, the split was effected in the form of a stock
dividend paid on July 14, 2006 to shareholders of record on June 23,
2006.  The effect on the balance sheet was to reduce  Paid-in capital
in excess of par value  by $1.3 billion and to increase  Common shares  by $1.3
billion.  All prior period common stock and applicable share and per
share amounts were retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. 

      In
February 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up to
$1.0 billion, which replaced our previous share repurchase
program.  In September 2006, our Board of Directors approved an
increase to our existing common share repurchase program of up to an additional
$2.0 billion.  In July 2007, our Board of Directors approved an
additional increase to our existing common share repurchase program of up to
$2.0 billion, bringing the entire authorization to $5.0 billion.  This
additional authorization may be used for open market share purchases or to
settle the conversion premium on our 3.125% convertible senior notes, should
they be redeemed.  The stock repurchase program does not require a
specific number of shares to be purchased and the program may be effected
through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately
negotiated transactions.  The program may be terminated or suspended
at any time.  From the inception of this program through December 31,
2007, we have repurchased approximately 79 million shares of our common stock
for approximately $2.7 billion at an average price per share of
$33.91.  These numbers include the repurchases of approximately 39
million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.4 billion at an average
price per share of $34.93 during 2007.  As of December 31, 2007, $2.3
billion remained available under our share repurchase
authorization. 

Preferred
Stock 

      Our
preferred stock consists of five million total authorized shares at December 31,
2007, of which none were issued. 

Stock
Incentive Plans 

      Our 1993
Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended (1993 Plan), provides for the grant of any
or all of the following types of stock-based awards: 

- 

stock
      options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
      options; 

- 

restricted
      stock awards; 

- 

restricted
      stock unit awards; 

- 

stock
      appreciation rights; and 

- 

stock
      value equivalent awards. 

There are
currently no stock appreciation rights or stock value equivalent awards
outstanding. 

      Under the
terms of the 1993 Plan, 98 million shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance to employees and non-employee directors.  The plan specifies
that no more than 32 million shares can be awarded as restricted
stock.  At December 31, 2007, approximately 18 million shares were
available for future grants under the 1993 Plan, of which approximately 10
million shares remained available for restricted stock awards.  The
stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the 1993 Plan may be
authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares. 

      In
addition to the provisions of the 1993 Plan, we also have stock-based
compensation provisions under our Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors and our ESPP. 

      Each of
the active stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed
below. 

      Stock
options 

      All stock
options under the 1993 Plan are granted at the fair market value of our common
stock at the grant date.  Employee stock options vest ratably over a
three- or four-year period and generally expire 10 years from the grant
date.  Stock options granted to non-employee directors vest after six
months.  Compensation expense for stock options is generally
recognized on a straight line basis over the entire vesting
period.  No further stock option grants are being made under the stock
plans of acquired companies. 

      The
following table represents our stock options activity during 2007, and includes
exercised, forfeited, and expired shares from our acquired companies  stock
plans. 

The total
intrinsic value of options exercised was $68 million in 2007, $123 million in
2006, and $194 million in 2005.  As of December 31, 2007, there was
$32 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures,
related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years. 

      Cash
received from option exercises was $110 million during 2007, $159 million during
2006, and $342 million during 2005.  The tax benefit realized from the
exercise of stock options was $22 million in 2007 and $42 million in
2006. 

      Restricted
stock 

      Restricted
shares issued under the 1993 Plan are restricted as to sale or
disposition.  These restrictions lapse periodically over an extended
period of time not exceeding 10 years.  Restrictions may also lapse
for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established
policies.  Upon termination of employment, shares on which
restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted
stock forfeitures.  The fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for the entire award. 

      Our
Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Directors Plan) allows for
each non-employee director to receive an annual award of 800 restricted shares
of common stock as a part of compensation.  These awards have a
minimum restriction period of six months, and the restrictions lapse upon the
earlier of mandatory director retirement at age 72 or early retirement from the
Board after four years of service.  The fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant is amortized over the lesser of the time from the grant
date to age 72 or the time from the grant date to completion of four years of
service on the Board.  We reserved 200,000 shares of common stock for
issuance to non-employee directors, which may be authorized but unissued common
shares or treasury shares.  At December 31, 2007, 115,200 shares had
been issued to non-employee directors under this plan.  There were
8,800 shares, 8,000 shares, and 6,400 shares of restricted stock awarded under
the Directors Plan in 2007, 2006, and 2005.  In addition, during 2007,
our non-employee directors were awarded 22,642 shares of restricted stock under
the 1993 Plan, which are included in the table below. 

      The
following table represents our 1993 Plan and Directors Plan restricted stock
awards and restricted stock units granted, vested, and forfeited during
2007. 

77 

The
weighted average grant-date fair value of shares granted during 2006 was $34.39
and during 2005 was $24.28.  The total fair value of shares vested
during 2007 was $79 million, during 2006 was $64 million, and during 2005 was
$49 million.  As of December 31, 2007, there was $153 million of
unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
nonvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 4.1 years. 

      2002
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

      Under the
ESPP, eligible employees may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, subject
to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common
stock.  Unless the Board of Directors shall determine otherwise, each
six-month offering period commences on January 1 and July 1 of each
year.  The price at which common stock may be purchased under the ESPP
is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
commencement date or last trading day of each offering period.  Under
this plan, 24 million shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance.  They may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury
shares.  As of December 31, 2007, 13.3 million shares have been sold
through the ESPP. 

Note
13.  Income per Share 

      Basic
income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period.  Effective April 5, 2007, common shares
outstanding were reduced by the 85.3 million shares of our common stock that we
accepted in exchange for the shares of KBR common stock we
owned.  Diluted income per share includes additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive
effect had been issued.  A reconciliation of the number of shares used
for the basic and diluted income per share calculation is as
follows: 

In
December 2004, we entered into a supplemental indenture that requires us to
satisfy our conversion obligation for our convertible senior notes in cash,
rather than in common stock, for at least the aggregate principal amount of the
notes.  This reduced the resulting potential earnings dilution to only
include the conversion premium, which is the difference between the conversion
price per share of common stock and the average share price.  See the
table above for the dilutive effect for 2007, 2006, and 2005. 

      Excluded
from the computation of diluted income per share were options to purchase three
million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2007 and two million
shares of common stock that were outstanding in both 2006 and
2005.  These options were outstanding during these years but were
excluded because the option exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares.

Note
14.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management 

      Foreign
exchange risk 

      Techniques
in managing foreign exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign
currency borrowing and investing and the use of currency derivative
instruments.  We selectively manage significant exposures to potential
foreign exchange losses considering current market conditions, future operating
activities, and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of
loss.  The purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities
is to protect us from the risk that the eventual dollar cash flows resulting
from the sale and purchase of services and products in foreign currencies will
be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 

      We manage
our currency exposure through the use of currency derivative instruments as it
relates to the major currencies, which are generally the currencies of the
countries in which we do the majority of our international
business.  These instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting
purposes and generally have an expiration date of two years or
less.  Forward exchange contracts, which are commitments to buy or
sell a specified amount of a foreign currency at a specified price and time, are
generally used to manage identifiable foreign currency
commitments.  Forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange option
contracts, which convey the right, but not the obligation, to sell or buy a
specified amount of foreign currency at a specified price, are generally used to
manage exposures related to assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency.  None of the forward or option contracts are exchange
traded.  While derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in
value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying
exposures being managed.  The use of some contracts may limit our
ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. 

      Foreign
currency contracts are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due
primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded
currencies).  We attempt to manage our working capital position to
minimize foreign currency commitments in non-traded currencies and recognize
that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should
cover the cost of exchange rate devaluations.  We have historically
incurred transaction losses in non-traded currencies. 

       Notional amounts and fair market
values.   The notional amounts of open forward contracts and
option contracts were $272 million at December 31, 2007 and $358 million at
December 31, 2006.  The notional amounts of our foreign exchange
contracts do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus,
are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these
contracts.  The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the
notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as exchange
rates.  The estimated fair market value of our foreign exchange
contracts was not material at both December 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006. 

      Credit
risk 

      Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are
primarily cash equivalents, investments, and trade receivables.  It is
our practice to place our cash equivalents and investments in high quality
securities with various investment institutions.  We derive the
majority of our revenue from sales and services to the energy
industry.  Within the energy industry, trade receivables are generated
from a broad and diverse group of customers.  There are concentrations
of receivables in the United States.  We maintain an allowance for
losses based upon the expected collectibility of all trade accounts
receivable.  In addition, see Note 5 for discussion of
receivables. 

      There are
no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty
related to our derivative contracts.  We select counterparties based
on their profitability, balance sheet, and a capacity for timely payment of
financial commitments, which is unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
events. 

      Interest
rate risk 

      Our
material outstanding debt instruments have fixed interest rates.  As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held no material interest rate derivative
instruments. 

79 

Fair market value of financial
instruments.   The estimated fair market value of long-term debt
was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2006, as
compared to the carrying amount of $2.8 billion at both December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006.  The fair market value of fixed-rate long-term debt
is based on quoted market prices for those or similar
instruments.  The carrying amount of short-term financial instruments,
cash and equivalents, receivables, short-term notes payable, and accounts
payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates fair
market value due to the short maturities of these instruments.  The
currency derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value
and are based upon third-party quotes. 

Note
15.  Retirement Plans 

      Our
company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of
our employees.  These plans include defined contribution plans,
defined benefit plans, and other postretirement plans: 

- 

our
      defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for
      services rendered.  These plans provide an individual account
      for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the
      participant s account are to be determined rather than the amount of
      pension benefits the participant is to receive.  Contributions
      to these plans are based on pretax income and/or discretionary amounts
      determined on an annual basis.  Our expense for the defined
      contribution plans for continuing operations totaled $162 million in 2007,
      $138 million in 2006, and $115 million in
2005; 

- 

our
      defined benefit plans include both funded and unfunded pension plans,
      which define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a
      function of age, years of service, or compensation;
  and 

- 

our
      postretirement medical plans are offered to specific eligible
      employees.  These plans are contributory.  For some
      plans, our liability is limited to a fixed contribution amount for each
      participant or dependent.  The plan participants share the total
      cost for all benefits provided above our fixed
      contributions.  Participants  contributions are adjusted as
      required to cover benefit payments.  We have made no commitment
      to adjust the amount of our contributions; therefore, for these plans the
      computed accumulated postretirement benefit obligation amount is not
      affected by the expected future health care cost inflation
      rate. 

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).   SFAS No. 158 requires an employer
to: 

- 

recognize
      on its balance sheet the funded status (measured as the difference between
      the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation) of pension and
      other postretirement benefit plans; 

- 

recognize,
      through comprehensive income, certain changes in the funded status of a
      defined benefit and postretirement plan in the year in which the changes
      occur; 

- 

measure
      plan assets and benefit obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal
      year; and 

- 

disclose
      additional information. 

The
requirements to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the additional
disclosure requirements were effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2006.  Accordingly, we adopted SFAS No. 158 for our fiscal year
ending December 31, 2006. 

      The
requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the
employer s fiscal year-end is effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2008.  We did not elect early adoption of these additional SFAS
No. 158 requirements and will adopt these requirements for our fiscal year
ending December 31, 2008. 

      The
discontinued operations of KBR have been excluded from all of the following
tables and disclosures. 

      Benefit
obligation and plan assets 

      The
following tables present plan assets, expenses, and obligation for retirement
plans for continuing operations.  We use a September 30 measurement
date for our international plans and an October 31 measurement date for our
domestic plans. 

80 

81 

Assumed
long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit
obligations, and rates of compensation increases vary for the different plans
according to the local economic conditions.  The weighted average
assumptions for the Nigerian, Indian, and Indonesian plans are not included in
the above tables as the plans were immaterial.  The discount rates
were determined based on the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of
high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of
the payment of the benefit obligations.  For our United Kingdom
pension plan, which constitutes 76% of our international pension plans 
projected benefit obligation, the discount rate increased from 5.0% at September
30, 2006 to 5.7% at September 30, 2007. 

      The
overall expected long-term rate of return on assets was determined based upon an
evaluation of our plan assets, historical trends, and experience, taking into
account current and expected market conditions. 

      Our
investment strategy varies by country depending on the circumstances of the
underlying plan.  Typically, less mature plan benefit obligations are
funded by using more equity securities, as they are expected to achieve
long-term growth while exceeding inflation.  More mature plan benefit
obligations are funded using more fixed income securities, as they are expected
to produce current income with limited volatility.  Risk management
practices include the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers
within each. 

82 

Amounts
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows: 

Expected
cash flows 

       Contributions.   Funding
requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country
where such plan resides.  In certain countries the funding
requirements are mandatory, while in other countries they are
discretionary.  We currently expect to contribute $29 million to our
international pension plans in 2008.  For our domestic plans, we
expect our contributions to be no more than $1 million in 2008.  We do
not have a required minimum contribution for our domestic plans; however, we may
make additional discretionary contributions, which will be determined after the
actuarial valuations are complete. 

       Benefit
payments.   The following table presents the expected benefit
payments over the next 10 years.

The
majority of our postretirement benefit plans are not subjected to risk
associated with fluctuations in the medical trend rates because the company
subsidy is capped.  However, for one plan in which the company subsidy
is not capped, the assumed health care cost trend rates could have an impact on
the amounts reported for the total of such health care plans.  A

      We
conduct some of our operations through joint ventures that are in partnership,
corporate, and other business forms and are principally accounted for using the
equity method.  Financial information pertaining to related companies
for our continuing operations is set out in the following
tables.  This information includes the total related-company balances
and not our proportional interest in those balances. 

      Combined
summarized financial information for all jointly owned operations that are
accounted for under the equity method was as follows: 

84 

Note
17.  New Accounting Standards 

      In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements,  which
is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
by defining fair value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value, and
expanding disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years.  In November 2007, the FASB deferred for one year the
application of the fair value measurement requirements to nonfinancial assets
and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value
on a recurring basis.  On January 1, 2008, we adopted without material
impact on our consolidated financial statements the provisions of SFAS No. 157
related to financial assets and liabilities and to nonfinancial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Beginning
January 1, 2009, we will adopt the provisions for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

      In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115.   SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible
assets and liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in
earnings.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007.  We adopted SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008 and did
not elect to apply the fair value method to any eligible assets or liabilities
at that time. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(Revised 2007),  Business
Combinations  (SFAS No. 141(R)).  SFAS No. 141(R) requires an
acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions.  SFAS No. 141(R) also changes the accounting treatment for
certain specific items.  SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  We
will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) for business combinations on or
after January 1, 2009. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,  Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements   An Amendment of ARB No. 51.   SFAS
No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary.  This statement requires the recognition of a
noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated
financial statements and separate from the parent s equity.  SFAS No.
160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  We will adopt the provision
of SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009 and have not yet determined the impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

      In
December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF 07-1,  Accounting
for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization
of Intellectual Property.   EITF 07-1 defines collaborative
arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between
participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
arrangement and third parties.  EITF 07-1 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim
periods within those fiscal years.  We will adopt EITF 07-1 on January
1, 2009, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders 

      Halliburton
Company: 

Under
date of February 20, 2008, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of
Halliburton Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders  equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007,
which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In
connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial statement
schedule (Schedule II) in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The
financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this
financial statement schedule based on our audits. 

In our
opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

Our
report on the financial statements referred to above, refers to a change in the
methods of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of January 1, 2007,
accounting for stock-based compensation plans as of January 1, 2006, and
accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31,
2006.

EXHIBIT 10-35  

RESIGNATION, GENERAL RELEASE AND
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  

       Supplementing and Amending the
Executive Employment Agreement  

This
Resignation, General Release and Settlement Agreement (   Supplement   ), is made
and entered into as of the Effective Date (as defined in Section 13 hereof), by
and among Andrew R. Lane (   Employee   ) and
Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. (   Employer   ), a
subsidiary of Halliburton Company (   Halliburton   ), for and
on behalf of itself, its parents, its subsidiaries, and its affiliated companies
(collectively, including Employer, the    Halliburton
Entities   ). 

WHEREAS , Employee is currently
employed by Employer pursuant to that certain Executive Employment Agreement,
dated as of January 1, 1999 (the    Employment
Agreement   ), a copy of which is attached hereto; and 

WHEREAS , the parties hereto
contemplate that Employee will voluntarily resign as an officer and director of,
and from all positions, posts, offices and assignments with Employer and any
other Halliburton Entity effective as of December 15, 2007, that Employee s
employment as a regular employee will terminate on December 31, 2007 (the    Termination Date   ),
and Employee will take early retirement, following which termination Employee
will be entitled to receive the benefits provided under (i) Section 3.3 of the
Employment Agreement, subject to Employee s compliance with the conditions set
forth in Section 3.4 of such Employment Agreement relating to execution of a
release in the form established by Employer and (ii) Section 10 of this
Supplement, subject to Employee s compliance with the conditions set forth in
Sections 8 and 9 of this Supplement relating to protection of Employer s
legitimate business interests and goodwill; and 

WHEREAS , the Employment
Agreement also provides that the severance benefits provided under Section 3.3
thereof are in consideration of Employee s continuing obligations under the
Employment Agreement following termination of employment, including obligations
under Article 4 relating to ownership and protection of Halliburton intellectual
property and confidential information; and 

WHEREAS , the parties desire to
amend and supplement the Employment Agreement by means of this Supplement to,
among other things, provide for a release of any claims or causes of action
Employee may have arising from or relating to his employment or service with
Employer and set forth the terms of Employee s continuing obligations relating
to the treatment of confidential information and protection of Employer s
legitimate business interests and goodwill; and 

WHEREAS , the parties wish to
affirm that the terms of the Employment Agreement remain in full force and
effect except as amended and supplemented hereby; and 

NOW, THEREFORE,  in
consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations contained in
this Supplement, the parties agree as follows: 

1.             Resignation .  Employee
shall continue to be employed by Employer through the Termination Date, at which
time he shall voluntarily resign from employment and simultaneously elect early
retirement. Notwithstanding Employee s voluntary resignation from employment and
voluntary election to take early retirement, Employee shall be entitled to
receive the severance benefits provided under Section 3.3 of the Employment
Agreement and such other benefits and amounts provided in this
Supplement.  On December 15, 2007, Employee shall voluntarily resign
as an officer and director of, and from all other positions, posts, offices and
assignments with, Employer and any other Halliburton Entity.  Employee
agrees to sign letters of resignation not inconsistent with the terms of this
Supplement, if requested by Employer, effective as of December 15, 2007.
Employee acknowledges that from and after December 15, 2007, he shall continue
as a regular employee but that he shall have no authority to, and shall not act
as an officer, director, employee or in any other capacity for Employer or any
Halliburton Entity. 

2.            Obligations of
Employee.  

(a) 

Employee
      agrees that the terms and conditions of this Supplement and the events
      (including negotiations) leading up to its execution shall remain
      confidential as between the parties and he shall not disclose them to any
      other person.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
      Employee will not respond to or in any way participate in or contribute to
      any public discussion, notice or other publicity concerning, or in any way
      relating to, execution of this Supplement or the events (including any
      negotiations) which led to its execution.  Employee further
      agrees that he shall not make, directly or indirectly, whether in writing,
      orally or electronically, any negative, derogatory or other comment that
      could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to the Halliburton
      Entities, their business or operations or any of their current or former
      employees, officers or directors.  The foregoing
      notwithstanding, Employee may disclose the terms of this Supplement to his
      immediate family, attorneys and financial advisors provided he informs
      them of this confidentiality provision and they agree to abide by
      it. 

(b) 

Employee
      agrees to an orderly transition of duties and will provide appropriate
      details to Employer concerning all of his current business activities and
      duties.  Employee agrees this transition period will end on the
      Termination Date. 

2 

(c) 

Employee
      reaffirms and acknowledges his existing and continuing obligations under
      the Employment Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligations
      set forth in Article 4 thereof relating to ownership and protection of
      intellectual property and confidential information. Except as may be
      required by law, Employee also agrees to maintain in confidence any
      proprietary and confidential information of customers, vendors, or other
      third parties received or of which he has knowledge as a result of his
      employment. The prohibitions of this subsection shall not apply, however,
      to information in the public domain (but only if the same becomes part of
      the public domain through means other than a disclosure prohibited
      hereunder or under the Employment
Agreement). 

(d) 

Employee
      agrees to leave in his office or deliver to Employer on or before the
      Termination Date all correspondence, memoranda, notes, records, data or
      information, analyses, drawings, photographs or other documents
      (including, without limitation, any computer-generated, computer-stored or
      electronically-stored materials) made, composed or received by Employee,
      solely or jointly with others, and which as of the Termination Date are in
      his possession, custody or control and which are related in any manner to
      the past, present or anticipated business of any of the Halliburton
      Entities (collectively, the    Company
      Information   ) without retaining any copies thereof. It is
      the intent of the parties that the foregoing covenant is applicable to all
      Company Information and all copies thereof, whether in writing or in
      electronic format, wherever located, including Company Information located
      on or in Employee s personally-owned property. Employee hereby grants and
      conveys to Employer all right, title and interest in and to, including,
      without limitation, the right to possess, print, copy and sell or
      otherwise dispose of, all Company Information, and copies, abstracts or
      summaries thereof, which may have been prepared by Employee or under his
      direction or which may have come into his possession in any way during the
      term of his employment with any of the Halliburton Entities and which
      relate in any manner to the past, present or anticipated business of any
      of the Halliburton Entities. 

(e) 

Employee
      represents and acknowledges that he has no claim or right, title or
      interest in the property or assets of any of the Halliburton Entities. On
      or before the Termination Date, Employee shall deliver any such property
      in his possession or control, including, without limitation, any
      computers, cellular telephones, any wireless devices such as a
       BlackBerry,  credit cards, telephone cards, office keys and security
      badges furnished by any of the Halliburton Entities for his
      use. 

3 

3.           Obligations
of Employer.  In addition to Employer s obligations under Article 3 of
the Employment Agreement, Employer agrees as follows: 

(a) 

Employee
      shall be entitled to receive his regular salary through the Termination
      Date. 

(b) 

Effective
      on the later of the Termination Date or the Effective Date, Employee s
      rights to the stock options granted to him under the 1993 Stock and
      Incentive Plan shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
      underlying stock option agreements applicable to approved retention of
      stock options upon early retirement, after which Employee may exercise
      such options, if at all, as permitted by such stock option agreements and
      for the length of time permitted
thereby. 

(c) 

Upon
      approval of the administrative committee appointed to administer the
      Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Benefit Restoration Plan,
      Employee will receive the aggregate balance of his accounts under such
      plans, including applicable interest, in a single lump sum payment, as
      soon as administratively feasible after the 2007 allocations to such
      accounts have been determined.  Employee recognizes that a
      portion of such payments may be subject to a six month waiting period
      under such plans in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section
      409A. 

(d) 

Employer
      acknowledges that Employee is a participant in certain retirement and
      welfare benefit plans and programs of Employer and Halliburton. Upon
      termination of Employee s employment, he shall receive the benefits to
      which he is entitled in accordance with such plans  respective terms;
      provided, however, that, since the severance benefits provided under the
      Employment Agreement and this Supplement are in excess of any severance
      benefits under Employer s severance benefit plan or program, Employee
      waives any right to severance benefits under such plan or program .  

(e) 

Employer
      will provide Employee with ten (10) months of outplacement services, or a
      lump sum payment of $15,000 at his
election. 

(f) 

Applicable
      withholding taxes will be deducted from all payments and other
      compensation due Employee under this Supplement or under the Employment
      Agreement when, as and if paid to
Employee. 

4 

4.            Prior Rights and
Obligations . Employee and Employer acknowledge that all rights and
obligations of the parties relating to the employment or termination of
employment of Employee with Employer or any of the Halliburton Entities are
embodied in this Supplement and the Employment Agreement. Except as set forth
herein and therein, the parties shall have no further employment or contractual
relationship; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not be
interpreted or construed in such a manner as to limit, extinguish or otherwise
adversely affect Employee s rights and the obligations of any of the Halliburton
Entities under any employee retirement or welfare benefit plans, except
severance plans, of Employer or the other Halliburton Entities in accordance
with such plans  respective terms. 

5.             No
Admissions .  Employee expressly understands and agrees that the
terms of this Supplement and the release contained herein are contractual and
not merely recitals and that the agreements herein and the consideration paid
pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Employment Agreement and Section 3 of this
Supplement is to compromise doubtful and disputed claims, avoid litigation, and
buy peace, having the force of  res judicata  accorded to
settlements under certain laws applicable to any of the Halliburton Entities,
and that no statement or consideration given shall be construed as an admission
of any claim by any of the Halliburton Entities or their respective employees,
officers, directors, shareholders, trustees, insurers, agents and
representatives (collectively, including Employer, the    Halliburton Parties   ),
all such admissions being expressly denied. Moreover, neither the Employment
Agreement, this Supplement nor anything in the Employment Agreement or this
Supplement shall be construed to be or shall be admissible in any proceeding as
evidence of an admission by Employer or Halliburton of any violation of their
policies, procedures, state or federal laws or regulations. The Employment
Agreement and this Supplement may be admitted into evidence, however, in any
proceeding to enforce such agreements. In such event, such admission shall be
pursuant to an order protecting its confidentiality. 

6.           Employee s
Representation.   (a)  Employee represents, warrants
and agrees that he has not filed any claims, appeals, complaints, charges or
lawsuits against any of the Halliburton Parties with any governmental agency or
court and that he will not file or permit to be filed or accept any benefit from
any claim, complaint or petition filed with any court by him or on his behalf at
any time hereafter; provided, however, that this shall not limit Employee from
enforcing his rights under the Employment Agreement and this Supplement.
Further, Employee represents and warrants that no other person or entity has any
interest in, or assignment of, any claims or causes of action he may have
against any Halliburton Party and which he now releases in their entirety; (b)
Additionally, Employee specifically acknowledges that he understands that he is
not waiving any right, claim, or legal matter through this Supplement that
cannot be waived, under law, by private agreement.  Employee also
understands that this Supplement is not intended to waive or interfere with his
right to institute a proceeding with any government agency where such waiver
would be contrary to law.  However, in connection with any such
proceeding, Employee waives any right or entitlement to additional compensation
or other individual relief except to the extent, if any, such waiver is
prohibited by law. 

5 

7.            General Release and
Discharge .  Except for those obligations created or
acknowledged by this Supplement and the Employment Agreement, and in
consideration of the payments and other benefits to be made or provided to
Employee under this Supplement and the Employment Agreement, and as a material
inducement to Employer to enter into this Supplement, Employee, on behalf of
himself and his heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, and successors,
hereby agrees to release, acquit and discharge and does hereby release, acquit
and discharge Employer, all Halliburton Entities and all Halliburton Parties
(both in their official and individual capacities), collectively and
individually, with respect to and from any and all claims and any and all causes
of action, of any kind or character, whether now known or unknown, he may have
against any of them which exist as of the Termination Date, including, but not
limited to, any claim for benefits, compensation, stock, stock options, costs,
damages, expenses, remuneration, salary or wages; and all claims or causes of
action arising from his employment, termination of employment, or any alleged
discriminatory employment practices, including but not limited to, any and all
claims and causes of action arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.   621,  et seq . (   ADEA   ) and any and all
claims and causes of action arising under any other federal, state or local laws
pertaining to discrimination in employment or equal employment opportunity;
except that the parties agree that Employee s release, acquittal and discharge
shall not relieve Employer from its obligations under the Employment Agreement
and this Supplement. This release also applies to any claims brought by any
person or agency or class action under which Employee may have a right or
benefit. 

8.            Proprietary and Confidential
Information/Non-Disclosure .   In accordance with
Employee's existing and continuing obligations, Employee agrees and acknowledges
that the various Halliburton Entities have developed and own valuable
information which is confidential, unique, with material pecuniary value on the
open market, and specific to the Halliburton Entities ("  Proprietary and Confidential
Information  ") and which includes, without limitation, trade
secrets; financial information, projections and forecasts; marketing plans and
strategies; business and implementation plans; engineering plans; prospect
lists; technical information concerning products, equipment, services and
processes; procurement procedures and pricing techniques; names and other
information (such as credit and financial data) concerning customers and
business affiliates; and all other concepts, ideas, plans, strategies, analyses,
surveys, and proprietary information related to the past, present or anticipated
business of various of the Halliburton Entities. Except as may be required by
law, Employee agrees that he will not at any time disclose to others, permit to
be disclosed, use, permit to be used, copy or permit to be copied, any such
Proprietary and Confidential Information (whether or not developed by Employee
and whether or not received as an employee) without prior written consent of the
Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton. Except as may be required by law,
Employee further agrees to maintain in confidence any proprietary and
confidential information of third parties received or of which he has knowledge
as a result of his employment. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that if
he is required by law, pursuant to a validly issued subpoena or other
governmental or legal process to disclose any Proprietary and Confidential
Information, Employee will immediately advise the Halliburton Entities that
a 

6 

subpoena
or other governmental order has been served, so that the Halliburton Entities
may have an opportunity to object or move to quash the subpoena or governmental
order in question.  The prohibitions of this Section 8 shall not
apply, however, to information in the public domain (but only if the same
becomes part of the public domain through a means other than a disclosure
prohibited hereunder). 

9.            Restrictive
Covenants:  Protection of Employer s Interests and
Goodwill . 

(a)   

Whereas,
      Halliburton is one of the world s largest oilfield services companies,
      providing a comprehensive range of services and products for the
      exploration, development, and production of oil and gas, to major
      national, international, and independent oil and gas companies throughout
      the world; and 

(b)   

Whereas,
      Employee acknowledges that in his role as Chief Operating Officer of
      Halliburton, he obtained, possessed and otherwise had substantial access
      to significant portions of Halliburton s Proprietary and Confidential
      Information as defined herein, including strategies and business plans;
      supervised and managed key employees, and was responsible for key customer
      and supplier relationships on a worldwide basis;
  and 

(c)   

Whereas,
      Employee and Employer agree and acknowledge that the Halliburton Entities
      have developed and own and will develop and own valuable Proprietary and
      Confidential Information and that the Halliburton Entities have goodwill
      and will continue to enjoy substantial goodwill unless disturbed by
      Employee. Employee and Employer further agree and acknowledge that the
      Halliburton Entities, and Employer on their behalf, have a substantial and
      legitimate business interest in protecting their Proprietary and
      Confidential Information and
goodwill. 

(d)   

Non-Competition
      Period :  For a 3-year period beginning on the first
      business day following the later of  the Termination Date or the
      Effective Date of this Supplement (the    Non-Competition
      Period   ), Employee agrees to the following
      covenants: 

7 

(i)            Non-Competition :
Employee will not directly or indirectly, for his own purposes or for the
purposes of others, participate in the ownership, management, operation or
control of, or be or become a stockholder, officer, employee, partner, director,
or agent of, or a consultant to, or render advice or services to, or otherwise
assist, any person, business or legal entity, their respective affiliates
(including affiliates formed or acquired after the date hereof) or successors
(collectively, the    Competitive
Businesses   ) in competing with any of the Halliburton Entities or
any of the activities relating to, arising under, or included within the
business activities of the Halliburton Entities, including those described in
Section 9(a) above, anywhere in the world. 

(ii)            Non-Solicitation :
Employee will not directly or indirectly, for his own purposes or for the
purposes of others, either as principal, agent, independent contractor,
consultant, director, officer, employee, employer, advisor, stockholder,
partner, or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever,
either for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity: (A)
hire or attempt to hire, contact or solicit with respect to hiring, any person
who is or who has been within the preceding nine-month period or during the
Non-Competition Period, an employee of, full-time consultant to, or contract
employee of any of the Halliburton Entities; or (B) induce or otherwise counsel,
advise or encourage any employee or full-time consultant to leave any of the
Halliburton Entities; or (C) attempt to divert or take away, or induce another
person to attempt to divert or take away, any customer, consultant, franchisee
or vendor of any of the Halliburton Entities with whom Employee dealt, directly
or indirectly, during his employment with Employer or any of the other
Halliburton Entities. 

(iii)           Geographic Scope of
Restriction :  The obligations of this Section 9 shall apply to
any geographic area in 

                                                     which
any of the Halliburton Entities: 

a.   

Has
      engaged in business by providing services and/or products for the
      exploration, development, and production of oil and gas, to major
      national, international, and independent oil and gas companies, including
      both United States and international locations;
  or 

b.   

Has
      otherwise established its goodwill, business reputation or any customer or
      supplier relations. 

The above
notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 9 shall prohibit Employee and his
affiliates from owning, as passive investors, in the aggregate not more than
five percent of equity securities of any publicly held Competitive
Business. 

8 

(e) 

Employee
      represents and warrants that the time, scope and geographic area
      restricted by the provisions of this Section are reasonable, that the
      enforcement of the restrictions contained herein will not be unduly
      burdensome on Employee, and that Employee will be able to earn a
      reasonable living while abiding by the terms imposed herein. Employee
      agrees that the restraints created by the covenants of this Section 9 are
      no greater than necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
      Halliburton Entities, including their Proprietary and Confidential
      Information and goodwill. In addition, Employee agrees that the need of
      the Halliburton Entities for the protection afforded by such covenants is
      not outweighed by the hardship to Employee, nor is any injury to the
      public likely to result from such restraints. Employee irrevocably waives
      all defenses to the strict enforcement of the covenants contained in this
      Section 9 and agrees that his breach or violation of the covenants
      contained in Sections 8 and/or 9, or any threatened breach or violation
      thereof, shall entitle Employer, on its own behalf or on behalf of any of
      the Halliburton Entities, as a matter of right, to specific performance
      and injunctive relief issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,
      without the requirement to post a bond, restraining any further or
      continued breach or violation of any such covenants. Such remedies shall
      not be deemed the exclusive remedies for breach of Sections 8 and/or 9,
      but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to
      Employer, including, without limitation, recovery of damages from Employee
      and his agents involved in such breach. In addition, Employee agrees that
      any breach by him of  any of the covenants contained in Sections
      8 and 9 will entitle Employer, for and on behalf of the other Halliburton
      Entities, to recover the payments or other consideration paid to Employee
      under Section 10 hereof. Further, Employee agrees that the Halliburton
      Entities are entitled to insist on full compliance by Employee with the
      full terms, including time periods, set forth in this Section
      9. 

(f) 

It
      is expressly understood and agreed that Employer and Employee consider the
      restrictions contained in this Section 9 to be reasonable and necessary to
      protect the Proprietary and Confidential Information and/or goodwill and
      that Employee s obligations to keep such information confidential shall
      survive termination of the Non-Competition Period. Nevertheless, if any of
      the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court having jurisdiction to be
      unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise
      unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth
      to be modified by such courts so as to be reasonable and enforceable and,
      as so modified by the court, to be fully enforced, it being expressly
      understood and agreed by Employee that the provisions of this Section are
      reasonably necessary to protect the Halliburton Entities  legitimate
      business interests and are designed particularly to protect their
      Proprietary and Confidential Information and
  goodwill. 

9 

10.            Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Consideration  .  

(a) 

In
      consideration of Employee's covenants and promises as set forth in
      Sections 8 and 9 hereof, but expressly subject to the provisions of
      Section 9(e), Employer will make a cash payment to Employee (i) in the
      gross amount of $1,050,000 to be paid in a single lump sum as soon as
      administratively practicable following the end of the Non-Competition
      Period; and (ii) for the prorated amount earned, if any, under the
      Performance Unit Program for the 2006 and 2007 performance cycles, which
      if due will be paid on the date payments are made to other participants
      under the Program, in accordance with the terms of such
      Program.  Employee shall not participate in the Performance Unit
      Program for any performance cycles other than the 2006 and 2007
      cycles. 

(b) 

Payment
      of the amounts set forth in Section 10(a) will be made only if Employee s
      obligations set forth in Sections 8 and 9 are fully satisfied at all times
      during the Non-Competition Period and at the time such amounts are
      payable. Employee understands and agrees that his right to all or any
      portion of the payment provided for herein, and Company's obligation
      to make payment of the entire amount or any portion thereof, are dependent
      and conditioned on Employee's compliance in full with all provisions
      contained in Sections 8 and 9.  Any failure on the part of Employee
      to comply with each such provision, including any attempt by or on behalf
      of Employee to have any such provision declared unenforceable in whole or
      in part by an arbitrator or court, shall excuse Employer forever from
      the obligation to make the payments, in whole or in part, provided for in
      Section 10(a). 

11.            ADEA
Rights .  Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that by
entering into this Supplement, he is waiving any and all rights or claims that
he may have arising under ADEA.  Employee further expressly
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(a) 

In
      return for the release contained in this Supplement, he will receive
      consideration beyond that which he would have been entitled to receive but
      for the Employment Agreement and this
  Supplement; 

(b) 

He
      was given a copy of this Supplement on December 12, 2007, and he has
      twenty-one (21) days from such date to review it before accepting, and
      that subsequent changes to this Supplement, whether material or
      immaterial, shall not restart such 21-day review
  period; 

(c) 

He
      has been advised in writing by Employer to consult with an attorney before
      signing this Supplement; and 

10 

(d) 

If
      he accepts this Supplement, he will have seven (7) days following the date
      of execution of this Supplement to revoke this
  Supplement. 

12.

Supplement for the above stated consideration. He warrants that he is fully
competent to execute this Supplement which he understands to be contractual. He
further acknowledges that he executes this Supplement of his own free will,

attorney, and without reliance on any representation of any kind or character
not expressly set forth herein. Finally, he executes this Supplement fully
knowing its effect and voluntarily for the consideration stated
above. 

13.            Effective Date . The
Effective Date shall be eight (8) days after the execution of this Supplement by
Employee and Employer, provided Employee has not exercised his right of
revocation pursuant to Section 11(d) above. This Supplement will become binding
in its entirety upon Employee and Employer, and all of its provisions will be
irrevocable on the Effective Date. 

14.             Payment of
Taxes .  Employee agrees that he shall be exclusively liable for
the payment of all employee federal and state taxes which may be due as a result
of the consideration received herein and Employee represents that he shall make
payments of such taxes at the time and in the amount required. 

15.            Dispute
Resolution.   Each of the parties affirm that Section 5.6 of the
Employment Agreement pertaining to resolution of disputes likewise controls with
respect to the resolution of disputes hereunder; provided, however, that
Employer, for and on behalf of itself and the other Halliburton Entities, shall
be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent any breach or a continuation of any breach of the
provisions of Sections 8 and/or 9 and Employee hereby consents that such
restraining order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of Employer
posting any bond. 

16.            Further
Executions .  The parties agree to cooperate fully and to
execute any and all supplementary documents and to take all additional actions
that may be necessary or appropriate to give full force to the basic terms and
intent of this Supplement and which are not inconsistent with its terms or the
terms of the Employment Agreement.

such matters. Each party to this Supplement acknowledges that no representation,
inducement, promise, or agreement, oral or written, has been made by either
party with respect to the foregoing matters which is not embodied in the
aforementioned agreements, and that no agreement, statement, or promise relating
to the employment or termination of employment of Employee that is not contained
in such agreements shall be valid and binding. No amendment to or modification
of this Supplement shall be effective unless reduced to writing and signed by
the parties. 

18.            Notice . For purposes
of this Supplement and the Employment Agreement, notices and all other
communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given when received by or tendered to Employee or Employer, as
applicable, by pre-paid courier or by United States registered or certified

notified. 

If to Employee, to his last known

19.            Section 409A of the

      applicable tax under Section 409A, Employee and Employer agree that such
      provision will be reformed to avoid imposition of the applicable tax in a
      manner that will result in the least adverse economic impact on
      Employee.

NOW, THEREFORE , for and in
consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations contained
herein, Employer and Employee agree as follows:

1: EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES: 

1.1.           Employer
agrees to employ Employee, and Employee agrees to be employed by Employer,

of Employee's employment pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 (the "Term"),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

1.2.           Beginning
as of the Effective Date, Employee shall be employed as  Vice President United States Region,

determined by Employer, as well as such additional or different duties and
services appropriate to such positions which Employee from time to time may be
reasonably directed to perform by Employer. 

1.3.           Employee
shall at all times comply with and be subject to such policies and procedures as

Employee's duties hereunder, is contrary to the interest of Halliburton or any
of its affiliated subsidiaries and divisions, including Employer (collectively,
the  Halliburton Entities  or, individually, a  Halliburton Entity ), or
requires any significant portion of Employee's business time.  The
foregoing notwithstanding, the parties recognize and agree that Employee may

injure any such entity's business, interests, or reputation. It is agreed that
any direct or indirect interest in, connection with, or benefit from any outside

Employee agrees that Employee shall not knowingly become involved in a conflict
of interest with Employer or the Halliburton Entities, or upon discovery

employment to another Halliburton Entity ("Subsequent Employer") as of, or at
any time after, the Effective Date and no such transfer shall be deemed to be a
termination of employment for purposes of Article 3 hereof; provided, however,
that, effective with such transfer, all of Employer's obligations hereunder
shall be assumed by and be binding upon, and all of Employer's rights hereunder
shall be assigned to, such Subsequent Employer and the defined term "Employer"

applicable to covered employees generally.

      Employee to Employer as provided in Section 5.2 hereof, provided such
      termination occurs within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
      notice period or (b) a termination of employment by Employee within six
      (6) months after a material reduction in Employee's rank or responsibility
      with Employer. 

4 

(v) 

Termination for
      Cause . Termination of Employee's employment by Employer for Cause.
      "Cause" shall mean any of the following: (a) Employee's gross negligence
      or willful misconduct in the performance of the duties and services
      required of Employee pursuant to this Agreement, (b) Employee's final
      conviction of a felony, (c) a material violation of the Code of Business
      Conduct or (d) Employee's material breach of any material provision of
      this Agreement which remains uncorrected for thirty (30) days following
      notice of such breach to Employee by Employer as provided in Section 5.2
      hereof. Determination as to whether or not Cause exists for termination of
      Employee's employment will be reasonably made by the Compensation
      Committee, or its delegate,   in good
      faith. 

In the event Employee's employment is
terminated under any of the foregoing circumstances, all future compensation to
which Employee is otherwise entitled and all future benefits for which Employee
is eligible shall cease and terminate as of the date of termination, except as
specifically provided in this Section 3.2. Employee, or his estate in the case
of Employee's death, shall be entitled to pro rata base salary through the date
of such termination and shall be entitled to any individual annual incentive
compensation not yet paid but earned and payable under Employer's or
Halliburton's annual incentive plans for the year prior to the year of
Employee's termination of employment, but shall not be entitled to any annual
incentive compensation for the year in which he terminates employment or any
other payments or benefits by or on behalf of Employer except for those which
may be payable pursuant to the terms of Employer's or Halliburton s employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3.4), stock, stock option or incentive
plans, or the applicable agreements underlying such plans. 

3.3           If
Employee's employment is terminated by Employee for Good Reason or by Employer
for any reason other than as set forth in Section 3.2 above, Employee shall be
entitled to each of the following, subject to the provisions of Section
3.4: 

(i) 

To
      the extent not otherwise specifically provided in any underlying
      restricted stock agreements, Halliburton, at its option and in its sole
      discretion, shall either (a) cause all shares of Halliburton common stock
      previously granted to Employee under the 1993 Plan, and any similar plan
      adopted by Halliburton in the future, which at the date of termination of
      employment are subject to restrictions (the "Restricted Shares") to be
      forfeited, in which case, Employer will pay Employee a lump sum cash
      payment equal to the value of the Restricted Shares (based on the closing
      price of Halliburton common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
      date of termination of employment); or (b) cause the forfeiture
      restrictions with respect to the Restricted Shares to lapse and such
      shares shall be retained by
Employee. 

(ii) 

Employer
      shall pay to Employee a severance benefit consisting of a single lump sum
      cash payment equal to two years' of Employee's base salary as in effect at
      the date of Employee's termination of employment.  Such
      severance benefit shall be paid no later than sixty (60) days following
      Employee's termination of
employment. 

5 

(iii) 

Employee
      shall be entitled to any individual incentive compensation earned under
      the Halliburton Annual Performance Pay Plan, or any successor annual
      incentive plan approved by the Compensation Committee, for the year of
      Employee's termination of employment determined as if Employee had
      remained employed by the Employer for the entire year.  Such
      amounts shall be paid to Employee at the time that such amounts are paid
      to similarly situated employees. 

3.4.           The
severance benefits paid to Employee pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be in
consideration of Employee's continuing obligations hereunder after such
termination, including, without limitation, Employee's obligations under Article
4. Further, as a condition to the receipt of such severance benefits, Employer
shall require Employee to first execute a release, in the form established by
Employer, releasing Employer and all other Halliburton Entities, and their
officers, directors, employees, and agents, from any and all claims and from any
and all causes of action of any kind or character, including, but not limited
to, all claims and causes of action arising out of Employee's employment with
Employer and any other Halliburton Entities or the termination of such
employment. The performance of Employer's obligations under Section 3.3 and the
receipt of the severance benefits provided thereunder by Employee shall
constitute full settlement of all such claims and causes of
action.  Employee shall not be under any duty or obligation to seek or
accept other employment following a termination of employment pursuant to which
severance benefits under Section 3.3 are owing and the amounts due Employee
pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not be reduced or suspended if Employee accepts
subsequent employment or earns any amounts as a self-employed individual.
Employee's rights under Section 3.3 are Employee's sole and exclusive rights
against the Employer or its affiliates and the Employer's sole and exclusive
liability to Employee under this Agreement, in contract, tort or otherwise, for
the termination of his employment relationship with Employer. Employee agrees
that all disputes relating to Employee s termination of employment, including,
without limitation, any dispute as to  Cause  or  Voluntary Termination  and any
claims or demands against Employer or Halliburton based upon Employee s
employment for any monies other than those specified in Section 3.3, shall be
resolved through the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan as provided in Section
5.6 hereof; provided, however, that decisions as to whether "Cause" exists for
termination of the employment relationship with Employee and whether and as of
what date Employee has become permanently disabled are delegated to the
Compensation Committee, or its delegate, for determination and any dispute of
Employee with any such decision shall be limited to whether the Compensation
Committee, or its delegate,  reached such decision in good
faith.  Nothing contained in this Article 3 shall be construed to be a
waiver by Employee of any benefits accrued for or due Employee under any
employee benefit plan (as such term is defined in the Employees' Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended) maintained by Employer or Halliburton
except that Employee shall not be entitled to any severance benefits pursuant to
any severance plan or program of the Employer or Halliburton. 

3.5.           Termination
of the employment relationship does not terminate those obligations imposed by
this Agreement which are continuing obligations, including, without limitation,
Employee's obligations under Article 4.

ARTICLE
4:  OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   AND
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: 

4.1.           All
information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries, and inventions, whether
patentable or not, which are conceived, made, developed or acquired by Employee,
individually or in conjunction with others, during Employee's employment by
Employer or any of its affiliates (whether during business hours or otherwise
and whether on Employer's premises or otherwise) which relate to the business,
products or services of Employer or its affiliates (including, without
limitation, all such information relating to corporate opportunities, research,
financial and sales data, pricing and trading terms, evaluations, opinions,
interpretations, acquisition prospects, the identity of customers or their
requirements, the identity of key contacts within the customer's organizations
or within the organization of acquisition prospects, or marketing and
merchandising techniques, prospective names, and marks), and all correspondence,
memoranda, notes, records, data or information, analyses, or other documents
(including, without limitation, any computer-generated, computer-stored or
electronically-stored materials) of any type embodying any of such items, shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Employer or its affiliates, as the case
may be. 

4.2.           Employee
acknowledges that the businesses of the various Halliburton Entities are highly
competitive and that they have developed and own valuable information which is
confidential, unique and specific to the Halliburton Entities ( Proprietary and
Confidential Information ) and which includes, without limitation, financial
information; marketing plans; business and implementation plans; engineering
plans; prospect lists; technical information concerning products, equipment,
services and processes; procurement procedures and pricing techniques; names and
other information (such as credit and financial data) concerning customers and
business affiliates; and other trade secrets, concepts, ideas, plans,
strategies, analyses, surveys and proprietary information related to the past,
present or anticipated business of various of the Halliburton
Entities.  Employee further acknowledges that protection of such
Proprietary and Confidential Information against unauthorized disclosure and use
is of critical importance to Employer and the other Halliburton Entities in
maintaining their competitive position. Employee hereby agrees that Employee
will not, at any time during or after his employment by Employer, disclose to
others, permit to be disclosed, use, permit to be used, copy or permit to be
copied, any such Proprietary and Confidential Information (whether or not
developed by Employee and whether or not received as an employee) without the
prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Employer. Employee
further agrees to maintain in confidence any proprietary and confidential
information of third parties received or of which he has knowledge as a result
of his employment. The prohibitions of this Section 4.2 shall not apply,
however, to information in the public domain (but only if the same becomes part
of the public domain through means other than a disclosure prohibited
hereunder).  The above notwithstanding, a disclosure shall not be
unauthorized if (i) it is required by law or by a court of competent
jurisdiction or (ii) it is in connection with any judicial, arbitration, dispute
resolution or other legal proceeding in which Employee's legal rights and
obligations as an employee or under this Agreement are at issue; provided,
however, that Employee shall, to the extent practicable and lawful in any such
events, give prior notice to Employer of his intent to disclose any such
Proprietary and Confidential Information in such context so as to allow Employer
or its affiliates an opportunity (which Employee will not oppose) to obtain such
protective orders or similar relief with respect thereto as may be deemed
appropriate. 

7 

4.3.           All
written materials, records, data and information, analyses, and other documents
(including, without limitation, any computer-generated, computer-stored or
electronically-stored data and other materials), and all copies thereof, made,
composed or received by Employee, solely or jointly with others, and which are
in Employee s possession, custody or control and which are related in any manner
to the past, present or anticipated business of any of the Halliburton Entities
(collectively, the  Company Documents ) shall be and remain the property of
Employer, or its affiliates, as the case may be. Upon termination of Employee's
employment with Employer, for any reason, Employee promptly shall deliver the
Company Documents, and all copies thereof, to Employer. 

4.4           For
purposes of this Article 4, "affiliates" shall mean Halliburton and entities in
which Employer or Halliburton has a 20% or more direct or indirect equity
interest. 

ARTICLE
5: MISCELLANEOUS: 

5.1.           Except
as otherwise provided in Section 4.4 hereof, for purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "affiliate" or "affiliated" means Halliburton and any other entity who
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with Halliburton or in which
Halliburton has a 50% or more equity interest. 

5.2.           For
purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for
herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
received by or tendered to Employee, Halliburton or Employer, as applicable, by
pre-paid courier or by United States registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows: 

If
      to Employer or Halliburton, to Halliburton Company at 5 Houston Center,
      1401 McKinney, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77010, to the attention of the
      General Counsel, or to such other address as Employee shall receive notice
      thereof. 

If
      to Employee, to his last known personal
  residence. 

5.3.           This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced, in all respects in
accordance with the law of the State of Texas, without regard to principles of
conflicts of law, unless preempted by federal law, in which case federal law
shall govern; provided, however, that the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan
and the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern in all respects with regard to the
resolution of disputes hereunder. 

5.4.           No
failure by either party hereto at any time to give notice of any breach by the
other party of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. 

8 

5.5.           It
is the desire and intent of the parties that the terms, provisions, covenants,
and remedies contained in this Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by law. If any such term, provision, covenant, or remedy of
this Agreement or the application thereof to any person, association, or entity
or circumstances shall, to any extent, be construed to be invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, then such term, provision, covenant, or
remedy shall be construed in a manner so as to permit its enforceability under
the applicable law to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any case, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person,
association, or entity or circumstances other than those to which they have been
held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and
effect. 

5.6.           It
is the mutual intention of the parties to have any dispute concerning this
Agreement resolved out of court.  Accordingly, the parties agree that
any such dispute shall, as the sole and exclusive remedy, be submitted for
resolution through the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan; provided, however,
that the Employer, on its own behalf and on behalf of any of the Halliburton
Entities, shall be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any breach or the continuation of any
breach of the provisions of Article 4 and Employee hereby consents that such
restraining order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of the
Employer posting any bond.  The parties agree that the resolution of
any such dispute through such Plan shall be final and binding. 

5.7.           This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employer, to the
extent herein provided, Halliburton and any other person, association, or entity
which may hereafter acquire or succeed to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of Employer or Halliburton by any means whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise. Employee's rights
and obligations under this Agreement are personal and such rights, benefits, and
obligations of Employee shall not be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned,
alienated, or transferred, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of Employer, other than in the case of death or
incompetence of Employee. 

5.8.           This
Agreement replaces and merges any previous agreements and discussions, oral and
written, pertaining to the subject matter covered herein. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the terms of
Employee's employment, termination of employment and severance benefits, and
contains all of the covenants, promises, representations, warranties, and
agreements between the parties with respect to such matters.  Each
party to this Agreement acknowledges that no representation, inducement,
promise, or agreement, oral or written, has been made by either party with
respect to the foregoing matters which is not embodied herein, and that no
agreement, statement, or promise relating to the employment of Employee by
Employer that is not contained in this Agreement shall be valid or binding. Any
modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and
signed by each party whose rights hereunder are affected thereby, provided that
any such modification must be authorized or approved in accordance with any
applicable policies and procedures of both Employer and
Halliburton.

I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS , Employee is currently
employed by Employer; and 

WHEREAS , Employer is desirous

such terms and conditions and for such consideration. 

NOW, THEREFORE , for and in
consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations contained
herein, Employer and Employee agree as follows: 

ARTICLE
1:   EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES: 

1.1.           Employer

of Employee s employment pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 (the  Term ),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

1.2.           Beginning
as of the Effective Date, Employee shall be employed as Division Vice President
  Operations, Completion Product Services, Production

such other managerial capacities as may be requested from time to time by
Employer and to perform diligently and to the best of Employee s abilities the
duties and services appertaining to such positions as reasonably determined by
Employer, as well as such additional or different duties and services
appropriate to such positions which Employee from time to time may be reasonably
directed to perform by Employer. 

1.3.           Employee
shall at all times comply with and be subject to such policies and procedures as
Halliburton Company ( Halliburton ) or Employer may establish from time to time,
including, without limitation, the Halliburton Company Code of Business Conduct
(the  Code of Business Conduct ). 

1.4.           Employee
shall, during the period of Employee s employment by Employer, devote Employee s
full business time, energy, and best efforts to the business and affairs of
Employer.  Employee may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any
other business, investment, or activity that interferes with Employee s

Halliburton or any of its affiliated subsidiaries and divisions, including
Employer (collectively, the  Halliburton Entities  or, individually, a
 Halliburton Entity ), or requires any significant portion of Employee s
business time.  The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties recognize
and agree that Employee may engage in passive personal investments and other
business activities which do not conflict with the business and affairs of the
Halliburton Entities or interfere with Employee s performance of his or her

injure any such entity s business, interests, or reputation.  It is
agreed that any direct or indirect interest in, connection with, or benefit from
any outside activities, particularly commercial activities, which interest might

possible conflict of interest.  In keeping with Employee s fiduciary
duties to Employer, Employee agrees that Employee shall not knowingly become
involved in an conflict of interest with Employer or the Halliburton Entities,
or upon discovery thereof, allow such a conflict to

contained herein shall be construed to preclude the transfer of Employee s
employment to another Halliburton Entity ( Subsequent Employer ) as of, or at
any time after, the Effective Date and no such transfer shall be deemed to be a
termination of employment for purposes of Article 3 hereof; provided, however,
that, effective with such transfer, all of Employer s obligations hereunder
shall be assumed by and be binding upon, and all of Employer s rights hereunder
shall be assigned to, such Subsequent Employer and the defined term  Employer 
as used herein shall thereafter be deemed amended to mean such Subsequent
Employer.  Except as otherwise provided above, all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, Employee s rights
and obligations, shall remaining in full force and effect following such

opportunity, shall be made in the sole discretion of the person or committee to
whom such authority has been granted pursuant to such plan s terms. 

2.3.           During
the Term, Employer shall pay or reimburse Employee for all actual, reasonable

basis generally as other similarly situated employees of Employer, in all
general employee benefit plans and programs, including improvements or
modifications of the same, which on the Effective Date or thereafter are made

      adopted by Halliburton in the future, which at the date of termination of
      employment are subject to restrictions (the  Restricted Shares ) will be
      treated in a manner consistent with Halliburton s past practices for
      treatment of Restricted Shares held by employees whose employment was
      involuntarily terminated by a Halliburton Entity for reasons other than
      Cause, which, in most instances, have been to forfeit the Restricted
      Shares and pay to such employee a lump sum cash payment equal to the value
      of the Restricted Shares (based on the closing price of Halliburton common
      stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of termination of
      employment); although in some cases, Halliburton has, in lieu of, or in
      combination with, the foregoing and in its discretion, caused the
      forfeiture restrictions with respect to all or a portion of the Restricted
      Shares to lapse and provided for the retention of such shares by such
      employee.

(ii) 

Subject
      to the provisions of Section 3.4, Employer shall pay to Employee a
      severance benefit consisting of a single lump sum cash payment equal to
      two years  of Employee s base salary as in effect at the date of
      Employee s termination of employment.  Such severance benefit
      shall be paid no later than sixty (60) days following Employee s
      termination of employment. 

(iii) 

Employee
      shall be entitled to any individual bonuses or individual incentive
      compensation not yet paid but payable under Employer s or Halliburton s
      plans for years prior to the year of Employee s termination of
      employment.  Such amounts shall be paid to Employee in a single
      lump sum cash payment no later than sixty (60) days following Employee s
      termination of employment. 

(iv) 

Employee
      shall be entitled to any individual bonuses or individual incentive
      compensation under Employer s or Halliburton s plans for the year of
      Employee s termination of employment determined as if Employee had
      remained employed by the Employer for the entire year.  Such
      amounts shall be paid to Employee at the time that such amounts are paid
      to similarly situated employees except that no portion of such amounts
      shall be deferred to future
years. 

6 

3.4.           The
severance benefit paid to Employee pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be in
consideration of Employee s continuing obligations hereunder after such
termination, including, without limitation, Employee s obligations under Article
4.  Further, as a condition to the receipt of such severance benefit,
Employer, in its sole discretion, may require Employee to first execute a
release, in the form established by Employer, releasing Employer and all other
Halliburton Entities, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents, from
any and all claims and from any and all causes of action of any kind or
character, including, but not limited to, all claims and causes of action
arising out of Employee s employment with Employer and any other Halliburton
Entities or the termination of such employment.  The performance of
Employer s obligations under Section 3.3 and the receipt of the severance
benefit provided thereunder by Employee shall constitute full settlement of all
such claims and causes of action.  Employee shall not be under any
duty or obligation to seek or accept other employment following a termination of
employment pursuant to which a severance benefit payment under Section 3.3 is
owing and the amounts due Employee pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not be reduced
or suspended if Employee accepts subsequent employment or earns any amounts as a
self-employed individual.  Employee s rights under Section 3.3 are
Employee s sole and exclusive rights against the Employer or its affiliates and
the Employer s sole and exclusive liability to Employee under this Agreement, in
contract, tort or otherwise, for the termination of his or her employment
relationship with Employer.  Employee agrees that all disputes
relating to Employee s termination of employment, including, without limitation,
any dispute as to  Cause  or  Voluntary Termination  and any claims or demands
against Employer or Halliburton based upon Employee s employment for any monies
other than those specified in Section 3.3, shall be resolved through the
Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan as provided in Section 5.6
hereof.  Nothing contained in this Article 3 shall be construed to be
a waiver by Employee of any benefits accrued for or due Employee under any
employee benefit plan (as such term is defined in the Employees  Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended) maintained by Employer or Halliburton
except that Employee shall not be entitled to any severance benefits pursuant to
any severance plan or program of the Employer or Halliburton. 

3.5.           Termination
of the employment relationship does not terminate those obligations imposed by
this Agreement which are continuing obligations, including, without limitation,
Employee s obligations under Article 4.

ARTICLE
4:  OWNERSHIP AND PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL 

PROPERTY
AND CONDIFENTIAL INFORMATION: 

4.1.           All
information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries, and inventions, whether
patentable or not, which are conceived, made, developed or acquired by Employee,
individually or in conjunction with others, during Employee s employment by
Employer or any of its affiliates (whether during business hours or otherwise
and whether on Employer s premises or otherwise) which relate to the business,
products or services of Employer or its affiliates (including, without
limitation, all such information relating to corporate opportunities, research,
financial and sales data, pricing and trading terms, evaluations, opinions,
interpretations, acquisition prospects, the identity of customers or their
requirements, the identity of key contacts within the customer s organizations
or within the organization of acquisition prospects, or marketing and
merchandising techniques, prospective names, and marks), and all writings or
materials of any type embodying any of such items, shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Employer or its affiliates, as the case may
be. 

4.2.           Employee
acknowledges that the businesses of Employer and its affiliates are highly
competitive and that their strategies, methods, books, records, and documents,
their technical information concerning their products, equipment, services, and
processes, procurement procedures and pricing techniques, the names of and other
information (such as credit and financial data) concerning their customers and
business affiliates, all comprise confidential business information and trade
secrets which are valuable, special, and unique assets which Employer or its
affiliates use in their business to obtain a competitive advantage over their
competitors.  Employee further acknowledges that protection of such
confidential business information and trade secrets against unauthorized
disclosure and use is of critical importance to Employer and its affiliates in
maintaining their competitive position.  Employee hereby agrees that
Employee will not, at any time during or after his or her employment by
Employer, make any unauthorized disclosure of any confidential business
information or trade secrets of Employer or its affiliates, or make any use
thereof, except in the carrying out of his or her employment responsibilities
hereunder.  Confidential business information shall not include
information in the public domain (but only if the same becomes part of the
public domain through a means other than a disclosure prohibited
hereunder).  The above notwithstanding, a disclosure shall not be
unauthorized if (i) it is required by law or by a court of competent
jurisdiction or (ii) it is in connection with any judicial, arbitration, dispute
resolution or other legal proceeding in which Employee s legal rights and
obligations as an employee or under this Agreement are at issue; provided,
however, that Employee shall, to the extent practicable and lawful in any such
events, give prior notice to Employer of his or her intent to disclose any such
confidential business information in such context so as to allow Employer or its
affiliates an opportunity (which Employee will not oppose) to obtain such
protective orders or similar relief with respect thereto as may be deemed
appropriate. 

8 

4.3.           All
written materials, records, and other documents made by, or coming into the
possession of, Employee during the period of Employee s employment by Employer
which contain or disclose confidential business information or trade secrets of
Employer or its affiliates shall be and remain the property of Employer, or its
affiliates, as the case may be.  Upon termination of Employee s
employment by Employer, for any reason, Employee promptly shall deliver the
same, and all copies thereof, to Employer. 

4.4.           For
purposes of this Article 4,  affiliates  shall mean entities in which Employer
or Halliburton has a 20% or more direct or indirect equity
interest. 

ARTICLE
5:  MISCELLANEOUS: 

5.1.           Except
as otherwise provided in Section 4.4 hereof, for purposes of this Agreement, the
terms  affiliate  or  affiliated  means an entity who directly, or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with Halliburton or in which Halliburton has a 50% or more equity
interest. 

5.2.           For
purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for
herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
received by or tendered to Employee, Halliburton or Employer, as applicable, by
pre-paid courier or by United States registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows: 

If
      to Employee, to his or her last known personal
  residence. 

5.3.           This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced, in all respects in
accordance with the law of the State of Texas, without regard to principles of
conflicts of law, unless preempted by federal law, in which case federal law
shall govern; provided, however, that the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan
and the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern in all respects with regard to the
resolution of disputes hereunder. 

5.4.           No
failure by either party hereto at any time to give notice of any breach by the
other party of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. 

9 

5.5.           It
is a desire and intent of the parties that the terms, provisions, covenants, and
remedies contained in this Agreement shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.  If any such term, provision, covenant, or remedy of
this Agreement or the application thereof to any person, association, or entity
or circumstances shall, to any extent, be construed to be invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, then such term, provision, covenant, or
remedy shall be construed in a manner so as to permit its enforceability under
the applicable law to the fullest extent permitted by law.  In any
case, the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof to
any person, association, or entity or circumstances other than those to which
they have been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and
effect. 

5.6.           It
is the mutual intention of the parties to have any dispute concerning this
Agreement resolved out of court.  Accordingly, the parties agree that
any such dispute shall, as the sole and exclusive remedy, be submitted for
resolution through the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Plan; provided, however,
that the Employer, on its own behalf and on behalf of any of the Halliburton
Entities, shall be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any breach or the continuation of any
breach of the provisions of Article 4 and Employee hereby consents that such
restraining order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of the
Employer posting any bond.  The parties agree that the resolution of
any such dispute through such Plan shall be final and binding. 

5.7.           This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employer, to the
extent herein provided, Halliburton and any other person, association, or entity
which may hereafter acquire or succeed to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of Employer or Halliburton by any means whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise.  Employee s rights and obligations under this Agreement are
personal and such rights, benefits, and obligations of Employee shall not be
voluntarily or involuntarily assigned, alienated, or transferred, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Employer,
other than in the case of death or incompetence of Employee. 

5.8.           This
Agreement replaces and merges any previous agreements and discussions pertaining
to the subject matter covered herein.  This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties with regard to the terms of Employee s
employment, termination of employment and severance benefits, and contains all
of the covenants, promises, representations, warranties, and agreements between
the parties with respect to such matters.  Each party to this
Agreement acknowledges that no representation, inducement, promise, or
agreement, oral or written, has been made by either party with respect to the
foregoing matters which is not embodied herein, and that no agreement,
statement, or promise relating to the employment of Employee by Employer that is
not contained in this Agreement shall be valid or binding.  Any
modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and
signed by each party whose rights hereunder are affected thereby, provided that
any such modification must be authorized or approved in accordance with any
applicable Halliburton policies and procedures. 

10 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF , Employer
and Employee have duly executed this Agreement in multiple originals to be
effective on the Effective Date.
