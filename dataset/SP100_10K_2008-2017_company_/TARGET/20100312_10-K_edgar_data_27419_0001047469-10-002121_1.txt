PART I        

Item 1.    Business            

General     

          Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We operate as two reportable segments: Retail and
Credit Card.   

          Our
Retail Segment includes all of our merchandising operations, including our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated
online business. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at discounted prices. Our ability to deliver a shopping experience that is preferred by our customers,
referred to as "guests," is supported by our strong supply chain and technology infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach
to managing our current business and investing in future growth. As a component of the Retail Segment, our online business strategy is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either
online or by locating them in one of our stores with the aid of online research and location tools. Our online shopping site offers similar merchandise categories to those found in our stores,
excluding food items and household essentials.   

          Our
Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card
Segment strengthens the bond with our guests, drives incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.   

Financial Highlights     

          Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to
fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2009 (2009) ended January 30, 2010, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and
consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted of 52 weeks.   

          For
information on key financial highlights, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Seasonality     

          Due to the seasonal nature of our business, a larger share of annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in the fourth quarter
because it includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December.   

Merchandise     

          We operate Target general merchandise stores, the majority of which offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited
assortment of food items. During 2009 we increased the offering within some of our general merchandise stores to include a deeper food assortment, including perishables and an expanded offering of
dry, dairy and frozen items. In addition, we operate SuperTarget stores with a full line of food and general merchandise items. Target.com offers a wide assortment of general merchandise including
many items found in our stores and a complementary assortment, such as extended sizes and colors, sold only online. A significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. In addition,
we sell merchandise under private-label brands including, but not limited to, Archer Farms , Archer Farms  Simply Balanced , Boots   Barkley ,
Choxie , Circo , Durabuilt , Embark , Gilligan   O'Malley , itso , Kaori , Market Pantry ,
Merona , Play Wonder , Room Essentials , Smith   Hawken , Sutton and Dodge , Target Home, Vroom , up  
up , Wine Cube , and Xhilaration . We also sell merchandise through unique programs such as ClearRx SM , GO International , Great
Save SM  and Home Design Event. In addition, we sell merchandise under exclusive licensed and designer brands including, but not limited to, C9 by Champion ,
Chefmate , Cherokee , Converse  One Star , Eddie Bauer , Fieldcrest , Genuine Kids by Osh Kosh , Kitchen
Essentials  by Calphalon , Liz Lange  for Target , Michael Graves Design , Mossimo , Nick   Nora , Sean
Conway , Simply Shabby Chic , Sonia Kashuk , Thomas O'Brien . We also generate revenue from in-store

amenities
such as Target Caf  SM , Target Clinic , Target Pharmacy , and Target Photo SM , and from leased or licensed departments such
as Optical, Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks.   

          Effective
inventory management is key to our future success. We utilize various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We
achieve effective inventory management by being in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and
apparel items to minimize markdowns.   

Household essentials includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning and paper products. Hardlines includes electronics (including
video game hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys. Apparel and accessories includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants, and
newborns. It also includes intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes. Home furnishings and d cor includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home
d cor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday d cor. Food and pet supplies includes dry grocery, dairy,
frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce and pet supplies.   

Distribution     

          The vast majority of our merchandise is distributed through our network of distribution centers. We operated 38 distribution centers,
including 4 food distribution centers, at January 30, 2010. General merchandise is shipped to and from our distribution centers by common carriers. In addition, certain food items are
distributed by third parties. Merchandise sold through Target.com is distributed through our own distribution network, through third parties, or shipped directly from vendors.   

Employees     

          At January 30, 2010, we employed approximately 351,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees,
referred to as "team members." During our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 390,000 team members. We consider our team member
relations to be good. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies, depending on team members'
full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical
and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, short-term and long-term disability insurance, paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life
insurance and merchandise discounts.   

Working Capital     

          Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period
from Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings.   

          Additional
details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Competition     

In our Retail Segment, we compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, Internet
retailers, wholesale clubs, category specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other   

  3  

Table of Contents   

forms
of retail commerce. Our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.   

In
our Credit Card Segment, our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at Target. Our financial products compete
with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume. Our ability to differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs, terms, credit line management,
and guest service determines our competitive position among credit card issuers.   

Intellectual Property     

          Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our
"Bullseye Design," have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain intellectual property protection for our private-label brands.   

Geographic Information     

          Substantially all of our revenues are generated in, and long-lived assets are located in, the United States.   

Available Information     

          Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge at www.Target.com (click on

www.Target.com (click on "Investors" and "Corporate Governance").    

Item 1A.    Risk Factors            

          Our business is subject to a variety of risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our
guests with a brand they trust. Meeting our guests' expectations requires us to manage various strategic, operational, compliance, and financial risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks
that we face.   

    If we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping
experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service and marketing efforts. Guest perceptions regarding the
cleanliness and safety of our stores, our in-stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margin and expenses.   

    If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margin and profitability could suffer.     

A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions in apparel, home d cor,
seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost
sales, spoilage and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations.   

    Our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of the Target brand.     

We believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at Target and our team members choose Target as a place of employment is
the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary   

  4  

Table of Contents   

constituencies:
guests, team members, the communities in which we operate, and shareholders. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand.
Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental
investigations or litigation, can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects on our business, including consumer boycotts, loss of new store development
opportunities, or team member recruiting difficulties.   

    We are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States.     

          All of our stores are located within the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health
of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further
dependence on local economic conditions in these states. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales
growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins.   

          In
addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales, these same considerations impact the success of our Credit Card Segment, as any deterioration can adversely
affect cardholders' ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit, resulting in higher bad debt
expense. The recent Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 has significantly restricted our ability to make changes to cardholder terms that are commensurate with
changes in the risk profile of our credit
card receivables portfolio. Demand for consumer credit is also impacted by macroeconomic conditions and other factors, and our performance can also be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use
debit cards or other forms of payment.   

    If we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

          With over 350,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our
ability to attract, train and retain a growing number of qualified team members. Many of those team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates.
Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, health care and other benefit costs and changing
demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with
increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth, and difficulty in executing plans for new stores, expansions and remodels
could increase our costs and capital requirements.     

          Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that
achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. In addition, for many sites we are dependent on a third
party developer's ability to acquire land, obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project, of which our store may be one component. Turmoil in the financial
markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect
our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing, expanding and remodeling our stores. A significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned
to occur within fully developed markets, which is generally a more time-consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets.

Table of Contents   

Interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results.     

We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its
commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could
lead to lost sales. In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial
instability, trade restrictions, increased tariffs, currency exchange rates, the outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security or other events that could slow port
activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.     

          If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests'
expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety
laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food
or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions
regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us
to regain the confidence of our guests.   

    If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our
reputation could suffer.     

          The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests. If we experience a data security
breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could
cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products, decline to use our pharmacy services, or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely
affect our results of operations.   

    Our failure to comply with federal, state or local laws, or changes in these laws could increase our expenses.     

          Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our
workforce (which is not represented by unions as of the end of 2009) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes affecting our
relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed,
minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit, Medicare reimbursements, privacy and
information security, product safety or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. In
addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Given the geographic concentration of our stores, natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations.     

          Our three largest states, by total sales, are California, Texas and Florida, areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent. Such
events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our
distribution centers and stores, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

          Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors. Changes in the tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or
our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to
capital market returns due to the tax-free nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities.   

    If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our growth plans, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.     

          We are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans. In
particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures, the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to
fund seasonal needs for working capital, and the asset-backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our
exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements,
fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures.   

    A significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our results of operations.     

          We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and summarize results. Our systems are subject to
damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may
incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions, which could
adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 2.    Properties            

          At January 30, 2010, we had 1,740 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia:   

The following table summarizes the number of owned or leased stores and distribution centers at January 30, 2010:   

(a)       Properties within the "combined" category are primarily owned buildings on leased land.        (b)       The 38 distribution
centers have a total of 48,588 thousand square feet.      

          We own our corporate headquarters buildings located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and we lease and own additional office space in the United States.
Our international sourcing operations have 27 office locations in 18 countries, all of which are leased. We also lease office space in Bangalore, India, where we operate various support functions. Our
properties are in good condition, well maintained and suitable to carry on our business.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings            

          SEC Rule S-K Item 103 requires that companies disclose environmental legal proceedings
involving a governmental authority when such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.   

We
are one of many defendants in a lawsuit filed on February 13, 2008, by the State of California involving environmental matters that may involve potential monetary sanctions in
excess of $100,000. The allegation, initially made by the California Air Resources Board in April 2006, involves a nonfood product (hairspray) that allegedly contained levels of a volatile organic
compound in excess of permissible levels. We anticipate that the settlement, to be fully indemnified by the vendor, is likely to exceed $100,000 but will not be material to our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General in June 2009 alleging that we did not handle and dispose of certain
unsold products as a hazardous waste. The case is in its early stages. We anticipate that this lawsuit may involve potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000, but will not be material to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

          We
are the subject of an ongoing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). In March 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of
Violation (FOV) related to alleged violations of the CAA, specifically the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated by the EPA for asbestos. The FOV pertains to
the remodeling of 36 Target stores that occurred between January 1, 2003 and October 28, 2007. The EPA FOV process is ongoing and no specific relief has been sought to date by the EPA.
We anticipate that any resolution of this matter will be in the form of monetary penalties that are likely to exceed $100,000 but will not be material to our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.   

          The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 requires SEC registrants to disclose if they have been required to pay certain penalties for failing to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
their participation in listed transactions. We have not been required to pay any of the penalties set forth in Section 6707A(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

PART II        

Item 5.    Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

          Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." We are authorized to issue up to
6,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0833, and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01. At March 10, 2010, there were 17,562 shareholders of record. Dividends
declared per share and the high and low closing common stock price for each fiscal quarter during 2009 and 2008 are disclosed in Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

          In
November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $10 billion of our common stock. In November 2008 we announced a temporary suspension of our
open-market share repurchase program. In January 2010, we resumed open-market purchases of shares under this program. Since the inception of this share repurchase program, we
have repurchased 103.6 million common shares for a total cash investment of $5,320 million ($51.36 per share).   

The
table below presents information with respect to Target common stock purchases made during the three months ended January 30, 2010, by Target or any "affiliated purchaser" of
Target, as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.   

The table above includes shares of common stock reacquired from team members who wish to tender
owned shares to satisfy the tax withholding on equity awards as part of our long-term incentive plans or to satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises. For the three months ended
January 30, 2010, 11,960 shares were acquired at an average per share price of $50.17 pursuant to our long-term incentive plans.   

   The table above includes shares reacquired upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. For the
three months ended January 30, 2010, no shares were reacquired through these contracts. At January 30, 2010, we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for 1.5 million
shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of $66 million, or an average per share price of $42.77. Refer to Notes 24 and 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details of these contracts.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations            

Executive Summary     

          Our 2009 financial results in both of our business segments were affected by the challenging economy in which we operated. In light of
that environment, performance in our Retail Segment was remarkable, as the segment generated the highest EBIT in the Corporation's history, in a year when comparable-store sales declined
2.5 percent. In the Credit Card Segment, disciplined management led to a 29.4 percent increase in segment profit in a year when Target's average investment in the portfolio declined
about 32 percent, representing a near-doubling of segment pretax return on invested capital.   

          Cash
flow provided by operations was $5,881 million, $4,430 million, and $4,125 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we opened 76 new stores
representing 58 stores net of 13 relocations and 5 closings. In 2008, we opened 114 new stores representing 91 stores net of 21 relocations and two closings.   

          Management's
Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

Analysis of Results of Operations     

    Retail Segment     

EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization.   

      EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes.   

(a)      New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the
reimbursements of $89 million in 2009, $117 million in 2008, and $114 million in 2007, are recorded as a reduction to SG A expenses within the Retail
Segment   .    

Retail Segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by
sales.   

    Sales     

          Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer
to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for 2009 were $63,435 million, compared with
$62,884 million in 2008 and $61,471 million in 2007. All periods were 52-week years. Growth in total sales between 2009 and 2008 as well as between 2008 and 2007 resulted
from sales from additional stores opened, offset by lower comparable-store sales. In 2009, deflation affected sales growth by approximately   

  13  

Table of Contents   

4 percentage
points, compared with an inflationary impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2008 and a deflationary impact of 2 percentage points in 2007.   

Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for a description of our product categories.   

          Comparable-store
sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable,
prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.   

  Comparable-store
sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including:   

sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open           sales from stores that have been relocated to new
buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the
new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes    

Comparable-store
sales do not include:   

sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget
store format           sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed    

The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing
sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length.   

          In fiscal 2009, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount, primarily due to a decrease in the
number of units per transaction. In 2008, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average transaction amount,
which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. Transaction-level metrics are influenced by a broad array of
macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and comparable-store sales rates are negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores.   

    Gross Margin Rate     

          Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail
price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences.
Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions.   

          In
2009, our gross margin rate was 30.5 percent compared with 29.8 percent in 2008. Our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories,
partially offset by the mix impact of faster   

14  

Table of Contents   

  sales
growth in lower margin rate categories (generally product categories of household essentials and food). The impact of rate performance within merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an
approximate 1.1 percentage point increase for 2009. This increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns. The impact of sales mix on gross margin rate was an approximate
0.4 percentage point reduction.   

In
2008 our gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which resulted in a
0.6 percentage point reduction in the
gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset
by favorable supply chain expense rates, as well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined impact on gross margin rate of an approximate
0.2 percentage point increase.   

Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate     

          Our selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense rate represents SG A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenses included in SG A expenses. SG A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit
card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

          SG A
expense rate was 20.5 percent in 2009 compared with 20.4 percent in both 2008 and 2007. The change in the rate was primarily driven by an approximate
0.4 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results. The rate increase was partially offset by an
approximate 0.2 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains in our stores. Within SG A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no expense categories that experienced a significant
fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared with prior periods.   

    Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate     

          Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2009, our
depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.2 percent compared with 2.9 percent in 2008 and 2.7 percent in 2007. The increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated
depreciation on assets that will be replaced as part of our 340-store 2010 remodel program. The comparative increase in 2008 was due to increased capital expenditures, specifically related
to investments in new stores.   

    Store Data     

(a)       Includes 13 store relocations in the same trade area and 5 stores closed without replacement.      (b)      Reflects total square

    Credit Card Segment     

          Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, or the amounts
received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card.   

(a)       New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges the cost of these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the reimbursements
of $89 million in 2009, $117 million in 2008, and $114 million in 2007, are recorded as an increase to Operations and Marketing expenses within the Credit Card
Segment.      (b)      Amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2009, 2008, and 2007, these amounts exclude $5,484 million,
$4,503 million, and $2,387 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables.      (c)      ROIC is return on invested
capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by Target, expressed as an
annualized rate.      (d)      As an annualized percentage of average gross credit card receivables.      

(a)       Balance-weighted one-month LIBOR.        (b)       As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables.
      (c)       Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates
tied to the
Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.    

          Our primary measure of segment profit in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the
interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In
addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial
performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire
portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. For the first quarter of 2009, the vast majority of our portfolio accrued finance charge
revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate. Effective April 2009, we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to cardholder account
balances. Under these terms, finance charges accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than 6%; if the Prime Rate is greater than 6%, finance charges accrue at the benchmark Prime
Rate, plus a spread. Because the Prime Rate was less than 6% during 2009, the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed APR subsequent to this terms change. As a result of
regulatory actions that impact our portfolio, effective January 2010, we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum APR for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate, and we
eliminated penalty   

  16  

Table of Contents   

pricing
for all current, or nondelinquent accounts. Penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time, generally 12 months, and is triggered when a cardholder
repeatedly fails to make timely payments.   

          In
2009, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $201 million from $155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance (Spread to LIBOR) and significantly lower
funding costs. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,922 million, a decrease of
$143 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by a lower Prime Rate, lower average receivables, higher finance charge and late-fee
write-offs and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and April 2009. Segment expenses were
$1,624 million, a decrease of $118 million, or 6.8 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses, on both a dollar and rate basis.
Segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower LIBOR rate compared to the prior year.   

          Segment
profit and dollar Spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million,
an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis, revenue yield decreased
2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in
third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our effective yield. Segment expenses
were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $770 million. The increase in bad debt
expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write-off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts
of $440 million for anticipated future write-offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to
the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008.   

(a)       Represents charges at Target (including sales taxes and gift cards) divided by sales (which excludes sales taxes and gift cards).      

(a)       Net write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges) less current period principal recoveries.

          Our 2009 period-end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of
12.2 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by tighter risk management and underwriting
initiatives that have significantly reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders, fewer new accounts being opened, and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions
in card usage by our guests, partially offset by the impact of a decline in payment rates.   

          Our
2008 period-end gross credit card receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average gross
credit card receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to
higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our
guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk cardholders.   

    Other Performance Factors     

    Net Interest Expense     

          Net interest expense was $801 million at the end of 2009, decreasing 7.5 percent, or $65 million from 2008. This
decline was due to a decrease in the annualized average portfolio interest rate from 5.3 percent to 4.8 percent partially offset by a $16 million charge related to the early
retirement of long-term debt. In 2008, net interest expense was $866 million compared with $647 million in 2007, an increase of 33.8 percent. This increase was due
primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate.

          Our effective income tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2009 and 37.4 percent in 2008. The decrease in the effective rate
between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009 compared with nondeductible
losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items.   

          Our
effective income tax rate for 2008 was 37.4 percent compared with 38.4 percent in 2007. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from
audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate was also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences
between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains
and losses from these investments are not taxable.   

Analysis of Financial Condition     

    Liquidity and Capital Resources     

          Our 2009 operations were entirely funded by internally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,881 in 2009 compared
with $4,430 million in 2008. This strong cash flow allowed us to fund capital expenditures of $1,729 million and pay off $1.3 billion of maturing debt with internally generated
funds. In addition we accelerated the payoff of a $550 million 2010 debt maturity, restarted our share repurchase program earlier than expected and experienced a $1.3 billion increase in
marketable securities at January 30, 2010.   

          Our
2009 period-end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of 12.2 percent. Average gross
credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the Credit Card Segment above. This trend and the factors
influencing it are likely to continue into 2010. Due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables, Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), using cash flows from the receivables, repaid an affiliate
of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) $163 million during 2009 under the terms of our agreement with them as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the
receivables balance continues to decline, TRC expects to continue to pay JPMC a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent.

          Year-end
inventory levels increased $474 million, or 7.1 percent from 2008, primarily due to unusually low inventory levels at the end of 2008 in response to
the challenging economic environment. Inventory levels were also higher to support traffic-driving strategic initiatives, such as food and pharmacy, in addition to comparatively higher retail square
footage. Accounts payable increased by $174 million, or 2.7 percent over the same period.   

          During
2009, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $479 million ($48.54 per share) under a $10 billion share
repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million
($50.49 per share).   

          We
paid dividends totaling $496 million in 2009 and $465 million in 2008, an increase of 6.7 percent. We declared dividends totaling $503 million ($0.67 per
share) in 2009, an increase of 6.8 percent over 2008. In 2008, we declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share), an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. We have paid
dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.   

Our
financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt
maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs.   

          Maintaining
strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows:

(a)    These
rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC.    

          At January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In past years, we
funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2009 we funded
our working capital needs through internally generated funds. Additionally and as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2008 we sold to JPMC an interest
in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a 7 percent discount.   

          An
additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will
expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2009 or 2008 under this facility.   

          Most
of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a
debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 30, 2010, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration
of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a
change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are
placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.   

          Our
interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent
expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 5.1x in 2009, 4.3x in 2008, and 6.4x in 2007.   

    Capital Expenditures     

          Capital expenditures were $1,729 million in 2009 compared with $3,547 million in 2008 and $4,369 million in 2007.
This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology-related assets. Our 2009 capital expenditures include $232 million related to stores that will
open in 2010 and   

  19

later
years. Net property and equipment decreased $475 million in 2009 following an increase of $1,661 million in 2008.   

Commitments and Contingencies     

          At January 30, 2010, our contractual obligations were as follows:   

(a)       Required principal payments only. Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. Principal
amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance, accelerated repayment
of this obligation may occur.      (b)      These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.25 percent plus a spread, for each year
outstanding.      (c)      Total contractual lease payments include $2,016 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably
assured of being exercised. These payments also include $196 million and $88 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2010 or later for capital and
operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of
leases.      (d)      Estimated tax contingencies of $579 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement.    

          Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations
include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license
commitments and service contracts.   

          We
issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to
be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these
obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to
cancellation.   

          We
have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans
has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans,
including our expected contributions for 2010, is included in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

          We
do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or
the availability of capital resources.

    Critical Accounting Estimates     

          Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis
and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. However
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our
critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:   

Inventory and cost of sales       We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method,
inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's
ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the
lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts.
Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has
diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or
increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Vendor income receivable       Cost of sales and SG A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is
earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable
for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is
earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Allowance for doubtful accounts       When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future
write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of
delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when
they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions;
however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. Credit card receivables are described
in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment       We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually
at the store level, on an annual basis or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on a long-lived
and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is
tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounting future cash flows. This test is performed at least annually or whenever an event or change in
circumstances indicates the   

  21  

Table of Contents   

carrying
value of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment on long-lived assets of $49 million in 2009, $2 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007 were recorded as
a result of the tests performed.   

          Our
estimates of future cash flows require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These
estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate values, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.   

Insurance/self-insurance       We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and
team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of
both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation
liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses
may differ from the amounts provided. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures.   

Income taxes       We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax
issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Pension and postretirement health care accounting       We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified
plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in
the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the
level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service.   

          Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market
conditions. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long-term rate of return used, and a 0.1 percent decrease in the expected long-term
rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $2 million.   

          The
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and
postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in Note 27 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent decrease to the weighted average discount
rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately $4 million.   

          Based
on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does
for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.   

          Pension
and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

New Accounting Pronouncements     

    Future Adoptions     

          In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 140" (SFAS 166), codified in the Transfers and Servicing accounting principles, which amends the derecognition guidance in former FASB Statement No. 140 and eliminates the
exemption from consolidation for qualifying special-purpose entities. This guidance will be effective for the   

  22  

Table of Contents   

Corporation
beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

In
June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" (SFAS 167), codified in the Consolidation accounting principles, which
amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments will significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis under former FASB Interpretation
No. 46(R). This guidance will be effective for the Corporation beginning in fiscal 2010 and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial
position.   

Outlook     

          In the Retail Segment, we expect to generate increases in comparable-store sales, likely in the range of 2 to 4 percent for the
year, including an expected 1 percentage point lift from our remodel program. While our comparable-store sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall, the expected incremental sales
resulting from remodels will grow as the year progresses. Additionally, we expect total sales to increase by a mid-single digit percentage.   

          In
2010 we expect to generally preserve our 2009 EBIT margin rate in our Retail Segment, which if achieved would result in our Retail Segment EBIT increasing in line with total sales
growth.   

          In
our Credit Card Segment, we expect the lower consumer usage of credit and our risk management strategies to continue throughout 2010, resulting in a low double-digit percentage
decline in gross credit card receivables by the end of the year. We also expect to maintain segment profit on a dollar basis at generally the level earned in 2009, generating a higher pretax segment
ROIC in 2010 than in 2009.   

          We
expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our long-term structural rate, likely in the range of 37.0 to 37.5 percent.   

          We
also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization.   

We
expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 to $2.5 billion, reflective of projects we will complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for our 2011 and 2012
new store programs. Our expectation is that our 2010 new store program will result in approximately 13 new stores and that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores.   

          Due
to the early repayment of an August 2010 debt maturity, the only significant remaining 2010 maturity, prior to our seasonal working capital peak (which typically occurs in October or
November), is the $900 million public series borrowing collateralized by our credit card receivables due in October.   

Forward-Looking Statements     

          This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are
typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward looking statements in this report include:
For our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales, expected merchandise returns, comparable-store sales trends and EBIT margin rates; for our Credit Card Segment, our outlook for year-end
gross credit card receivables, portfolio size, future write-offs of current receivables, profit, ROIC, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; on a consolidated basis, the expected
effective income tax rate, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2010 and 2011, the expected compliance
with debt covenants, our intentions regarding future dividends, the anticipated impact of new accounting pronouncements, our expected future share-based compensation expense, our expected
contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team
member medical and dental, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, and the resolution of tax uncertainties.   

All
such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our
actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in
conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            

          Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at
a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime-based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we
generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability
matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At January 30, 2010, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net
floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2010, the annualized effect of a
0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease
earnings before income taxes by approximately $1 million. See further description in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

          We
record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in
certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects
of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 30, 2010, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease
earnings before income taxes by approximately $9 million.   

          In
addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on
pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $22 million at January 30, 2010. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect
against declines in interest rates we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately
50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.   

          As
more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in
our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our
own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified
defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.   

          We
do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in
U.S. dollars.   

          Overall,
there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.

Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data            

    Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements     

           Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated
financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary
judgments and estimates by management.   

           To
fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in
accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of
internal control provide this reasonable assurance.   

           The
Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent
directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and objectivity are
sufficient to protect shareholders' investments.   

           In
addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this
page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of January 30,
2010 and January 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended January 30,
2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

           In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at
January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2010, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 30, 2010, based on criteria established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 12, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Report of Management on Internal Control     

           Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on the framework in    Internal Control Integrated
Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.   

           Our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered accounting firm who has also
audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on criteria
established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.   

           We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

           Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

In
our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target
Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of the
three years in the period ended January 30, 2010, and our report dated March 12, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     

1. Summary of Accounting Policies     

    Organization       Target Corporation (Target or the Corporation) operates two reportable segments: Retail and Credit Card. Our Retail Segment includes all of our
merchandising operations, including our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated online business. Our Credit Card Segment offers credit
to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card Segment strengthens the bond with our guests, drives
incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.   

    Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities'
operations. The variable interest entity consolidated is a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary through which we sell certain accounts receivable as a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable.   

Use of estimates       The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.   

    Fiscal year       Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2009 (2009) ended January 30, 2010 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and consisted of
52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted of 52 weeks.   

    Reclassifications       Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   

          Accounting
policies applicable to the items discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement are described in the respective notes.   

2. Revenues     

          Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Sales from our online business include shipping revenue and are
recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return
merchandise within 90 days of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns as a percentage of sales. Commissions earned on sales
generated by leased departments are included within sales and were $18 million in 2009, $19 million in 2008, and $17 million in 2007.   

Revenue
from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was immaterial in 2009,
2008, and 2007.   

          Credit
card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement. When accounts are written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees are
recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail sales charged to our credit cards totaled $3,277 million, $3,883 million, and $4,139 million in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. We offer new account discounts and rewards programs on our REDcard products. These discounts are redeemable only on purchases made at Target. The discounts associated with our
REDcard products are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $94 million in 2009, $114 million in 2008, and $110 million in 2007.

      Other administrative costs

Terms cash discount  

Distribution center costs, including compensation  

and benefits costs  

The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.     

4. Consideration Received from Vendors     

          We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and
advertising allowances and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG A expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement.
Promotional and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments
that do not meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a
reduction of cost of sales.   

          We
establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount
earned when we have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables
associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter.   

5. Advertising Costs     

          Advertising costs are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement and were $1,167 million in 2009,
$1,233 million in 2008, and $1,195 million in 2007. Advertising vendor income that offset advertising expenses was approximately $130 million, $143 million, and
$123 million 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Newspaper circulars and media broadcast made up the majority of our advertising costs in all three years.

Table of Contents   

6. Earnings per Share     

          Basic earnings per share (EPS) is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit
arrangements.   

For the 2009, 2008, and 2007 EPS computations, 16.8 million, 10.5 million, and 6.3 million stock options, respectively, were
excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive. Refer to Note 26 for a description of the prepaid forward contracts referred to
in the table above.   

7. Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)     

          Other comprehensive income/(loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP and are
recorded directly to shareholders' investment. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, other comprehensive income/(loss) included gains and losses on certain hedge transactions, foreign currency translation
adjustments and amortization of pension and postretirement plan amounts, net of related taxes. Significant items affecting other comprehensive income/(loss) are shown in the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders' Investment.   

8. Fair Value Measurements     

          Fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A
liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Fair value
measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable
market inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).   

  33  

Table of Contents    

          The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   

(a)       There were no interest rate swaps designated as accounting hedges at January 30, 2010 or January 31, 2009.      (b)      Company-owned life insurance investments consist of equity index funds and fixed income assets. Amounts are presented net of loans that are secured by some of
these policies of $244 million at January 30, 2010 and $197 million at January 31, 2009.    

Position   
     
   Valuation Technique   

Marketable securities  
     
  Initially valued at transaction price. Carrying value of cash equivalents (including money market funds) approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months.  

Prepaid forward contracts  
     
      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock.  

Interest rate swaps/forward and equity swaps  
     
      Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation
model (   e.g.   , interest rates and credit spreads). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit
spreads.  

Company-owned life insurance investments  
     
      Includes investments in separate accounts that are valued based on market rates credited by the insurer.  

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but
are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The fair value measurements related to long-lived assets held for
sale and held and used in the following table were determined using available market prices at the measurement date based on recent investments or pending transactions of similar assets, third-party
independent appraisals, valuation multiples or public comparables. We classify these measurements as Level 2. The fair value measurement of an intangible asset was determined using unobservable
inputs that reflect our own assumptions regarding how market participants price the intangible assets at the measurement date. We classify these measurements as Level 3.

Table of Contents   

          The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not measured at fair value in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The fair value of marketable securities is determined using available market prices at the reporting date. The fair value of debt is generally measured
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments.   

(a)       Amounts include held-to-maturity government and money market investments that are held to satisfy the capital requirements of Target Bank and Target National
Bank.      (b)      Represents the sum of nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables and unsecured debt and other borrowings excluding unamortized swap valuation
adjustments and capital lease obligations.    

          The carrying amounts of credit card receivables, net of allowance, accounts payable, and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate
fair value at January 30, 2010.   

9. Cash Equivalents     

          Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. Cash
equivalents also include amounts due from credit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days. Receivables resulting from third-party credit card sales within our Retail Segment are
included within cash equivalents and were $313 million and $323 million at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Payables resulting from the use of the
Target Visa at third-party merchants are included within cash equivalents and were $40 million and $53 million at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.   

10. Credit Card Receivables     

          Credit card receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance, recognized in an amount equal to the
anticipated future write-offs of existing receivables, was $1,016 million at January 30, 2010 and $1,010 million at January 31, 2009. This allowance includes
provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends, and
industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Total receivables past due ninety days or more and still accruing finance charges were
$371 million at January 30, 2010 and $393 million at January 31, 2009. Accounts are written off when they become 180 days past due.   

          Under
certain circumstances, we offer cardholder payment plans that modify finance charges and minimum payments, which meet the accounting definition of a troubled debt restructuring
(TDRs). These concessions are made on an individual cardholder basis for economic or legal reasons specific to each individual cardholder's circumstances. As a percentage of period-end
gross receivables, receivables classified as TDRs were 6.7 percent at January 30, 2010 and 4.9 percent at January 31, 2009. Receivables classified as TDRs are treated
consistently with other aged receivables in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts.   

          As
a method of providing funding for our credit card receivables, we sell on an ongoing basis all of our consumer credit card receivables to Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), a
wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. TRC then transfers the receivables to the Target Credit Card Master Trust (the Trust), which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties
either directly or through a related trust. These debt   

  35  

Table of Contents   

  securities
represent undivided interests in the Trust assets. TRC uses the proceeds from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the receivables to pay the purchase price of the
receivables to the Corporation.   

          We
consolidate the receivables within the Trust and any debt securities issued by the Trust, or a related trust, in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the
applicable accounting guidance. The receivables transferred to the Trust are not available to general creditors of the Corporation. The payments to the holders of the debt securities issued by the
Trust or the related trust are made solely from the assets transferred to the Trust or the related trust and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the Corporation. Upon termination of the
securitization program and repayment of all debt securities, any remaining assets could be distributed to the Corporation in a liquidation of TRC.   

In
the second quarter of 2008, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to JPMC. The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the
transaction. This transaction was accounted for as a secured borrowing, and accordingly, the credit card receivables within the Trust and the note payable issued are reflected in our Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, the accounts receivable assets that collateralize the note payable supply the cash flow to pay principal and interest to
the note holder; the receivables are not available to general creditors of the Corporation; and the payments to JPMC are made solely from the
Trust and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the Corporation. Interest and principal payments due on the note are satisfied provided the cash flows from the Trust assets are sufficient. If the
cash flows are less than the periodic interest, the available amount, if any, is paid with respect to interest. Interest shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the assets in
the Trust are sufficient. Future principal payments will be made from JPMC's prorata share of cash flows from the Trust assets.   

          In
the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that JPMC's interest in the entire portfolio would exceed 47 percent for three consecutive months, TRC (using
the cash flows from the assets in the Trust) would be required to pay JPMC a prorata amount of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent, unless JPMC
provides a waiver. Conversely, at the option of the Corporation, JPMC may be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their 47 percent interest up to a maximum JPMC principal
balance of $4.2 billion. If a three-month average of monthly finance charge excess (JPMC's prorata share of finance charge collections less write-offs and specified expenses) is
less than 2 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's interest, the Corporation must implement mutually agreed upon underwriting strategies. If the three-month average finance
charge excess falls below 1 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's interest, JPMC may compel the Corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities, provided those
activities are compatible with the Corporation's systems, as well as consistent with similar credit card receivable portfolios managed by JPMC. If the Corporation fails to implement the activities,
JPMC would cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in the transaction. As noted in the preceding paragraph, payments would be made solely from the Trust assets.   

11. Inventory     

          Substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales are accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM)
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. Cost includes purchase price as reduced by vendor income. Inventory is also
reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices.   

Under
RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventory. RIM is an averaging
method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are
currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.   

          We
routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Revenues under this program are
included in sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position because
of the virtually simultaneous purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled $1,820 million in 2009, $1,524 million in 2008, and $1,643 million
in 2007.   

  36  

Table of Contents   

12. Other Current Assets     

(a)       Includes pharmacy receivables and income taxes receivable.    

13. Property and Equipment     

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease term if shorter. We amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning
of the initial lease term over the shorter of the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold
improvements are acquired. Depreciation expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $1,999 million, $1,804 million, and $1,644 million, respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated
depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and were $632 million in 2009, $609 million in 2008, and $592 million in 2007.
Facility preopening costs, including supplies and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's
carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments of $49 million in 2009, $2 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007 were recorded as a result of the tests performed.
Additionally, we wrote off $37 million in 2009, $26 million in 2008 and $4 million in 2007 of capitalized construction in progress costs due to project scope changes.   

14. Other Noncurrent Assets     

(a)       Company-owned life insurance policies on approximately 4,000 team members who are designated highly compensated under the Internal Revenue Code and have given their consent to be
insured.      (b)      See Notes 8 and 20 for additional information relating to our interest rate swaps.    

15. Goodwill and Intangible Assets     

          Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded within other noncurrent assets at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill totaled
$59 million at January 30, 2010 and $60 million at January 31, 2009. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested at least annually or whenever an event or change in
circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value for the purposes of the required annual impairment
analysis. An impairment loss on a long-lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the
asset are less than the asset carrying amount.   

  37  

Table of Contents   

No
material impairments related to goodwill and intangible assets were recorded in 2009, 2008, or 2007 as a result of the tests performed. Intangible assets by major classes were as
follows:   

(a)       Other intangible assets relate primarily to acquired trademarks and customer lists.    

          Amortization is computed on intangible assets with definite useful lives using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives
that typically range from 9 to 39 years for leasehold acquisition costs and from 3 to 15 years for other intangible assets. Amortization expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was
$24 million, $21 million, and $15 million, respectively.   

16. Accounts Payable     

          We reclassify book overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Overdrafts reclassified to accounts payable were $539 million
at January 30, 2010 and $606 million at January 31, 2009.   

17. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities     

(a)       Taxes payable consist of real estate, team member withholdings and sales tax liabilities.      (b)      Gift card liability
represents the amount of gift cards that have been issued but have not been redeemed, net of estimated breakage.    

18. Commitments and Contingencies     

          Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise
royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were approximately $2,016 million and $570 million at
January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider
purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are not firm commitments as they are conditional on the purchase order
not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation under certain circumstances.   

          Trade
letters of credit totaled $1,484 million and $1,359 million at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively, a portion of which are reflected in
accounts payable. Standby letters of credit, relating primarily to   

  38  

Table of Contents   

  retained
risk on our insurance claims, totaled $72 million and $64 million at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.   

          We
are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest
of our shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe
that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

19. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt     

          We obtain short-term financing throughout the year under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable.   

An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a
group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2009 or 2008 under this credit facility.   

          As
further explained in Note 10, we maintain an accounts receivable financing program through which we sell credit card receivables to a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned
subsidiary, which in turn transfers the receivables to a Trust. The Trust, either directly or through related trusts, sells debt securities to third parties. The following summarizes this activity for
fiscal 2008 and 2009.   

(a)       Represents the accretion of the 7 percent discount on the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC.    

          Other than debt backed by our credit card receivables and other immaterial borrowings, all of our outstanding borrowings are senior, unsecured
obligations.

          At
January 30, 2010, the carrying value and maturities of our debt portfolio, including swap valuation adjustments for our fair value hedges, was as follows:   

(a)       Reflects the weighted average stated interest rate as of year-end.    

          Required principal payments on notes and debentures over the next five years, excluding capital lease obligations, are as follows:   

(a)       The required principal payments presented in this table do not consider the potential accelerated repayment requirements under our agreement with JPMC in the event of a decrease in
credit card receivables.    

          Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant,
our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.   

20. Derivative Financial Instruments     

          Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our derivative
instruments have been primarily interest rate swaps. We use these derivatives to mitigate our interest rate risk. We have counterparty credit risk resulting from our derivate instruments. This risk
lies primarily with two global financial institutions. We monitor this concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis.   

Prior
to 2009, the majority of our derivative instruments qualified for fair value hedge accounting treatment. The changes in market value of an interest rate swap, as well as the
offsetting change in market value of the hedged debt, were recognized within earnings in the current period. We assessed at the inception of the hedge whether the hedging derivatives were highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. Ineffectiveness resulted when changes in the market value of the hedged debt were not completely offset by changes in the
market value of the interest rate swap. For those derivatives whose terms met the conditions of the "short-cut method", 100 percent hedge effectiveness was assumed. There was no
ineffectiveness recognized in 2009, 2008, or 2007 related to our derivative instruments. As detailed below, at January 30, 2010, there were no derivative instruments designated as accounting
hedges.   

          During
the first quarter of 2008, we terminated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $3,125 million for cash proceeds of
$160 million, which are classified within other operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These swaps were designated as hedges; therefore, concurrent with their
terminations, we were required to stop making market value adjustments to the associated hedged debt. Gains realized upon termination will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the
associated hedge debt.   

  40  

Table of Contents   

          Additionally,
during 2008, we de-designated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps, and upon de-designation, these swaps no longer qualified for hedge
accounting treatment. As a result of the de-designation, the unrealized gains on these swaps determined at the date of de-designation will be amortized into earnings over the
remaining lives of the previously hedged items.   

          In
2009, 2008, and 2007, total net gains amortized into net interest expense for terminated and de-designated swaps were $60 million, $55 million, and
$6 million, respectively. The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated and de-designated interest rate swaps that will be amortized into earnings
over the remaining lives totaled $197 million, $263 million, and $14 million, at the end of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.   

          Simultaneous
to the de-designations during 2008, we entered into "pay fixed" swaps to economically hedge the risks associated with the de-designated "pay
floating" swaps. These swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and along with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in
fair value measurements are a component of net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

          At
January 30, 2010, a characteristic summary of interest rate swaps outstanding was:

During 2007, we entered into a series of interest rate lock agreements that effectively fixed the interest payments on our anticipated issuance of
debt that would be affected by interest-rate fluctuations on the U.S. Treasury benchmark between the beginning date of the interest rate locks and the date of the issuance of the debt.
Upon our issuance of fixed-rate debt in fiscal 2007, we terminated these rate lock agreements with a combined notional amount of $2.5 billion for cash payment of $79 million,
which is classified within other operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The loss of $48 million, net of taxes of $31 million, has been recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss and is being recognized as an adjustment to net interest expense over the same period in which the related interest costs on the debt are recognized in earnings. During 2007,
the amount reclassified into earnings was not material. During 2008 and 2009, the amount reclassified into earnings as an increase to interest expense from accumulated other comprehensive income was
$3 million ($5 million pre tax) and $3 million ($5 million pre tax). The amount expected to be reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income for
2010 is $3 million ($5 million pre tax).

21. Leases     

          We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, equipment and land. Assets held under capital lease
are included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of the property.
At lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising
those options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The expected lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate
straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the depreciable life of buildings and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.   

          Rent
expense on buildings is included in SG A. Some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels. Total rent expense was
$174 million in 2009, $169 million in 2008, and $165 million in 2007, including immaterial amounts of percentage rent expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Certain leases require us to
pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in SG A consistent with similar costs for owned locations.
Most long-term leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to more than fifty years. Certain leases also include options to
purchase the leased property.   

(a)       Total contractual lease payments include $2,016 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes
$88 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that will open in 2010 or later.      (b)      Calculated using the interest rate at inception for each
lease.      (c)      Includes the current portion of $   5    million.

22. Income Taxes     

          Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for
the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. We have not
recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Such amounts are not significant.   

The decrease in the effective rates between 2009 and 2008 is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to
economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation obligations in 2009 compared with nondeductible losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state
discrete items. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate was
also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on
investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable.   

We file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to
U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2006 and, with few   

  43  

Table of Contents   

exceptions,
are no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.   

If the Corporation were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefit liabilities recorded, approximately $210 million of the
$452 million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In addition, the reversal of accrued penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are recorded within income tax expense. During the year ended January 30, 2010, we reversed accrued penalties and interest of approximately
$10 million. During the years ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, we recognized approximately $33 million, and $37 million, respectively, in interest and
penalties. We had accrued for the payment of interest and penalties of approximately $127 million at January 30, 2010 and $153 million at January 31, 2009.   

          Included
in the balance at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 are $133 million and $116 million, respectively, of liabilities for tax positions for which
the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the cash payment to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
During 2010, we will file a tax accounting method change allowed under applicable tax regulations that will determine the timing of deductions for one of our tax positions. Accordingly, this
change will result in a decrease in the unrecognized tax benefit liability of approximately $130 million in the next twelve months. Additionally, it is reasonably possible that the amount of
the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities with respect to other of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next twelve months; however, we do not currently expect any change
to have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position.   

          During
2009, we filed income tax returns that included tax accounting method changes allowed under applicable tax regulations. These changes resulted in a substantial increase in tax
deductions related to property and equipment, resulting in an increase in noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $300 million and a corresponding increase in current income
taxes receivable, which is classified as other current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These changes did not affect income tax expense for 2009.   

23. Other Noncurrent Liabilities     

We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with
these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General
liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.

24. Share Repurchase     

          In November 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program totaling $10 billion that replaced a prior program.
In November 2008, we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program. In January 2010, we resumed
open-market purchases of shares under this program.   

          Share
repurchases for the last three years, repurchased primarily through open market transactions, were as follows:   

Of the shares reacquired and included above, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. The prepaid forward contracts
settled in 2009 had a total cash investment of $56 million and an aggregate market value of $60 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in
2008 had a total cash investment of $249 million and an aggregate market value of $251 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in 2007 had a
total cash investment of $165 million and an aggregate market value of $215 million at their respective settlement dates. These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce
our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 26.   

          Our
share repurchases during 2008 included 30 million shares that were acquired through the exercise of call options.   

(a)       Paid in January 2008.    

25. Share-Based Compensation     

          We maintain a long-term incentive plan for key team members and nonemployee members of our Board of Directors. Our
long-term incentive plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share unit awards, restricted stock unit
awards, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards.   

          A
majority of granted awards are nonqualified stock options that vest annually in equal amounts over a four-year period and expire no later than 10 years after the
grant date. Options granted to the nonemployee members of our Board of Directors become exercisable after one year and have a 10-year term.   

          We
have issued performance share unit awards annually since January 2003. These awards represent shares potentially issuable in the future; historically, awards have been issued based
upon the attainment of compound annual growth rates in revenue and EPS over a three year performance period. Beginning with the March 2009 grant, issuance is based upon the attainment of compound
annual EPS growth rate and domestic market share change relative to a retail peer group over a three-year performance period.   

          We
regularly issue restricted stock units with three-year cliff vesting to select team members. We also regularly issue restricted stock units to our Board of Directors. The
number of unissued common shares   

  45  

Table of Contents   

  reserved
for future grants under the share-based compensation plans was 21,450,009 at January 30, 2010 and 25,755,800 at January 31, 2009.   

(a)       Includes Stock Appreciation Rights granted to certain non-U.S. team members.      (b)      Weighted average per
share.      (c)      Represents stock price appreciation subsequent to the grant date, in millions.      (d)      Assumes
attainment of maximum payout rates as set forth in the performance criteria.   
      (e)      Because the performance criteria were not met, approximately 644 thousand of these performance share units outstanding at January 30, 2010 were
not earned and will be forfeited in the first quarter of 2010.    

          We used a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based on the assumptions noted in the following
table. Volatility represents an average of market estimates for implied volatility of 5.5-year options on Target common stock. The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of
options already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients' behavior. The risk-free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities
as of each applicable grant date. The assumptions disclosed below represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for all of our stock option grants throughout the years.   

Total share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $103 million, $72 million, and
$73 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The related income tax benefit was $40 million, $28 million, and $28 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.   

At January 30, 2010, there was $147 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.   

  46  

Table of Contents   

The
weighted average remaining life of currently exercisable options is 4.9 years, and the weighted average remaining life of all outstanding options is 8.8 years. The total fair value
of options vested was $85 million, $69 million, and $55 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.   

          Compensation
expense associated with outstanding performance share units is recorded over the life of the awards. The expense recorded each period is dependent upon our estimate of the
number of shares that will ultimately be issued. Future compensation expense for currently outstanding awards could reach a maximum of $51 million assuming payout of all outstanding awards.
There were no share based liabilities paid during 2009. The total share based liabilities paid were $15 million in 2008 and $18 million in 2007.   

          Total
unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards was $16 million as of January 30, 2010.   

26. Defined Contribution Plans     

          Team members who meet certain eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to
80 percent of their compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match 100 percent of each team member's contribution up to 5 percent of total compensation.
Company match contributions are made to the fund designated by the participant.   

          In
addition, we maintain nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans for approximately 3,500 current and retired team members. These team members choose from a menu of crediting
rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an additional 2 percent per year to the accounts of all active
participants, excluding executive officer participants, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in a plan of this nature. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred
compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering 11 active and 50 retired participants. In this plan deferred compensation earns returns tied to market levels of interest rates, plus an
additional 6 percent return, with a minimum of 12 percent and a maximum of 20 percent, as determined by the plan's terms.   

          The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added Section 409A to the Internal Revenue Code, changing the federal income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation
arrangements. Failure to comply with the new requirements would result in early taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, as well as a 20 percent penalty tax and additional
interest payable to the IRS. In response to these new requirements, we allowed participants to elect to accelerate the distribution dates for their account balances. Participant elections resulted in
payments of $29 million in 2009 and $86 million in 2008.   

          We
control some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock
that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains and
losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recorded in earnings was pretax
income/(loss) of $36 million in 2009, $(19) million in 2008, and $6 million in 2007. During 2009 and 2008, we invested approximately $34 million and $215 million,
respectively, in such investment instruments, and these investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing activities. Adjusting our position in these
investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, these repurchases totaled 1.5 million,
4.7 million, and 3.4 million shares, respectively, and are included in the total share repurchases described in Note 24.   

47  

Table of Contents   

The settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty.   

(a)       Investment loss/(income) includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on prepaid forward contracts and unrealized and realized gains and losses on company-owned life insurance
policies.    

27. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans     

          We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering all U.S. team members who meet age and service requirements, including in
certain circumstances, date of hire. We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits
varies depending on team members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon retirement, team members also become eligible for certain health care benefits if they meet
minimum age and service requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost. Effective January 1, 2009, our qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants, with
limited exceptions.   

          We
recognize that our obligations to plan participants can only be met over time through a combination of company contributions to these plans and earnings on plan assets. In light of
this concept and as a result of declines in the market value of plan assets in 2008 (which were only partially offset by increases in 2009), we elected to contribute $252 million to our
qualified plans during 2009. This restored the qualified plans to a fully-funded status at year-end on an ABO (Accumulated Benefit Obligation) basis.   

          During
2009 we amended our postretirement health care plan, resulting in a $46 million reduction to our recorded liability, with a corresponding increase to shareholders' equity
of $28 million, net of taxes of $18 million. The financial benefits of this amendment will be recognized though a reduction of benefit plan expense over the next 6 years.   

          The
following tables provide a summary of the changes in the benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position for our postretirement benefit plans:

Assumptions     

          Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of the measurement date were as follows:   

50  

Table of Contents   

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense for each fiscal year were as follows:   

(a)       Due to the remeasurement from the plan amendment in the third quarter of 2009, the discount rate was decreased from 6.50 percent to 4.85 percent.    

          The discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year
(   i.e   ., the prior measurement date). With an essentially stable asset allocation over the following time periods, our annualized rate of return on
qualified plans' assets has averaged 4.6 percent, 4.5 percent and 8.9 percent for the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year periods, respectively, ended
January 30, 2010.   

          The
expected Market-Related Value of Assets ("MRV") is determined each year by adjusting the previous year's value by expected return, benefit payments, and cash contributions. The
expected MRV is adjusted for asset gains and losses in equal 20 percent adjustments over a 5-year period.   

          Our
expected annualized long-term rate of return assumptions as of January 30, 2010 were 8.5 percent for domestic and international equity securities,
5.5 percent for long-duration debt securities, 8.5 percent for balanced funds, and 10.0 percent for other investments. Balanced funds primarily invest in equities,
nominal and inflation-linked fixed income securities, commodities, and public real estate. They seek to generate capital market returns while reducing market risk by investing globally in highly
diversified portfolios of public securities. These estimates are a judgmental matter in which we consider the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment
performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in
our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets.   

          An
increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of 7.5 percent for non-Medicare eligible individuals and 8.5 percent for Medicare eligible individuals
was assumed for 2009. In 2010, the rate is assumed to be 7.5 percent for non-Medicare eligible individuals and 7.5 percent for Medicare eligible individuals. Both rates will
be reduced to 5.0 percent in 2019 and thereafter.   

          A
one percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at January 30, 2010:

Plan Assets     

          The plan's asset allocation policy is designed to reduce the long-term cost of funding our pension obligations. The plan
invests with both passive and active investment managers depending on the investment's asset class. The plan also seeks to reduce the risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates by
employing an interest rate hedging program, which may include the use of interest rate swaps, total return swaps, and other instruments.

Table of Contents   

          Our
pension plan weighted average asset allocations at the measurement date by asset category were as follows:   

(a)       Equity securities include our common stock in amounts substantially less than 1 percent of total plan assets as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009.
      (b)       Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and distressed debt, timber-related assets, and a 4 percent allocation to real estate.    

The fair values of our pension plan assets as of the measurement date, by asset category are as follows:   

(a)       This category includes investments in US small, mid, and large cap companies as well as common collective funds that represent passively managed index funds with holdings in domestic
and international equities.        (b)       This category primarily consists of investments in government securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and passively managed index
funds with holdings in
long-term government and corporate bonds.        (c)       This category invests primarily in private equity funds (including venture capital, mezzanine and high yield debt, natural
resources, and timberland), multi-strategy hedge funds
(including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds and other alternative investments), and real estate.

Position    
     
   Valuation Technique    

Cash and cash equivalents  
     
  Initially valued at transaction price. Carrying value of cash equivalents (including money market funds) approximates fair value because maturities are generally less than three months.  

Equity securities  
     
      Valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  

Common collective funds/balanced funds/certain multi-strategy hedge funds  
     
      Valued using the net asset value ("NAV") provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted transactional price for
participants in the fund, which do not represent an active market.  

Fixed income securities  
     
      Valued using matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.  

Private equity/real estate/certain multi-strategy hedge funds  
     
      Valued by deriving Target's proportionate share of equity investment from audited financial statements. Private equity and real
estate investments require significant judgment on the part of the fund manager due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such investments. Certain multi-strategy hedge funds represent funds
of funds that include liquidity restrictions and for which timely valuation information is not available.  

Contributions     

          In 2009, we made discretionary contributions of $252 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We are not required
to make any contributions in 2010, although we may choose to make discretionary contributions of up to $100 million. We expect to make contributions in the range of $10 million to
$15 million to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2010.   

    Estimated Future Benefit Payments     

          Benefit payments by the plans, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

28. Segment Reporting     

          Our measure of profit for each segment is a measure that management considers analytically useful in measuring the return we are
achieving on our investment.   

(a)       The combination of bad debt expense and operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment represent credit card expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
      (b)       New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges the cost of these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the
reimbursements
of $89 million in 2009, $117 million in 2008, and $114 million in 2007 are recorded as a reduction to SG A expenses within the Retail Segment and an increase to operations and
marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.      

Note: The sum of the segment amounts may not equal the total amounts due to rounding.     

Substantially all of our revenues are generated in, and long-lived assets are located in, the United States.   

29. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)     

          Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total
year revenues and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving through the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial
data. The table below summarizes quarterly results for 2009 and 2008:   

Note:  Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the
quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding and all other quarterly amounts may not equal the total year due to
rounding.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures            

          As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

          There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS   

SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1          History.     The Company originally established this Plan
(formerly known as the Target Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan I)
effective as of January 1, 1995. 
The Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan intended to replace certain
pension benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees who are officers.  The Plan
provides retirement benefits not provided under the Pension Plan as a result of
the limitations imposed by Code sections 401(a)(17) and 415.   The Plan is intended to be a  top hat plan 
as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended from time to time.   Since the
effective date of this Plan, upon a Participant becoming an Officer of the
Company, the benefit due under the Target Corporation SPP IV has been
transferred to this Plan.  Effective April 30,
2002, for Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate
Operating Committee, the Company transferred the present value of the vested
benefit due under this Plan to the Officer EDCP.  Effective July 31, 2002, this transfer
was extended to all Officers of the Company. 
After such transfer, no benefits were due or payable to the Participant
from this Plan. Further, after the transfer, the individuals would no longer
participate in this Plan or be eligible for further accruals under this
Plan.  Effective January 1, 2005
(and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in
compliance with Code section 409A.  The
Plan, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and
restated effective January 1, 2009. 
This Plan Statement, which was amended to incorporate the Company s
recoupment policy, is effective January 13, 2010.

(to the extent allowed under Code section 409A).  

6.1.3       Transfers from SPP
IV.      Benefits transferred to this Plan from SPP IV
will have the distribution timing, form, and rights as provided under SPP IV,
but upon transfer will be subject to the distribution terms of the Officer

April 30 (or the immediately preceding business day) immediately following
the calendar year in which a Participant is first eligible to participate in
this Plan and has a vested benefit, a Participant will have his or her vested
benefit that is determined under this Plan transferred to the Officer
EDCP.  The transfer will be an amount
equal to the actuarial lump sum present value on March 31 (or the
immediately preceding business day) for the Participant s SPP Benefit accrued
through the preceding December 31. 
In the case of a Participant who is an executive officer, such transfer
will be made and determined on or about the last business day prior to the end
of the Company s fiscal year.  

(b)                                     Notwithstanding

a Plan termination upon a Change-in-Control under Section 8.3.2 prior to
the date in Section 6.2.1(a), the transfer will be made within 60 days
following such event.  

6.2.2       Benefit to Be
Transferred.     The benefit
transferred to the Officer EDCP is the vested benefit accrued and determined
under this Plan at the time of transfer to the Officer EDCP provided in Section 6.2.1.  The transfer to the Officer EDCP will not
change the payment form, payment timing, or vested status of the benefit
determined under this Plan.  After the
transfer to the Officer EDCP, the benefit will be subject to the terms of the
Officer EDCP, including the acceleration or delay of distributions permitted
thereunder.

SECTION 7 
NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1              Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation of the Participating Employers
to provide benefits pursuant to this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but
legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to provide such
benefits.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company
or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any
rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts
or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company.  

7.2              Spendthrift Provision.     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2,
no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can
be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to
anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the
possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize
any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other
legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 7.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.  

7.3          Compensation Recovery
(Recoupment)    .     Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan, a Participant who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of
the Company s consolidated financial statements and who becomes subject to the
Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the
Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy )
may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited
and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his
or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company.  

(a)              Any portion of the Participant s benefit resulting
from the receipt of compensation that is subject to recovery under the
Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding
adjustment will be made to the Participant s benefit under this Plan.  

(b)             If a Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is
entitled to receive a distribution under this Plan and the Participant is
subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company
may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any portion
of the Participant s (or the Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net of state,
federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim.  

11    

SECTION 8  
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1              Adoption.     With the prior
approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become
a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified
copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting the Plan.  

8.2          Amendment.   

8.2.1       General Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or reasonable to comply
with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective to decrease the
benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to any Participant
with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the
date of such amendment.  The Committee is
authorized to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or
desirable by the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan
provided such amendment does not have a material financial impact on the
Company.  Such changes will be considered
an Amendment to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the
Board.  Written notice of any amendment shall
be given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

8.2.2       Amendment to Benefit
of Executive Officer.     Any amendment
to the benefit of an executive officer under this Plan, to the extent approval
of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.  

8.2.3       No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

8.3          Termination.   

8.3.1       General Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate this Plan, provided such termination satisfies the requirements
of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

8.3.2       Plan Termination on
Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and the transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if
and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.  

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding    

12    

of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein
as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or
(ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

13    

SECTION 9  
CLAIM PROCEDURES   

9.1          Claim Procedures.     Until
modified by the Plan Administrator, the claim and review procedures set forth
in this Section shall be the mandatory claim and review procedures for the

withdrawal shall be considered as a claim for the purposes of this Section.  

9.1.1           Initial Claim.     An individual
may, subject to any applicable deadline, file with the Plan Administrator a    written claim for benefits under    the Plan in a    form and manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator.

the adverse benefit determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
claim.  

(b)                                     The ninety (90)
day period for making the claim determination may be extended for ninety (90)
days if the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an
extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
ninety (90) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

9.1.2           Notice of Initial Adverse Determination.     A notice of an adverse determination shall
set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:

initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant may file with the Plan
Administrator a written request for a review of the adverse determination and
may, in connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records and
other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely.  

9.1.4           Claim on Review.     If the claim,
upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify
the claimant of the adverse benefit determination within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such a request for review.  

14    

(a)                                      The sixty (60)

extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
sixty (60) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

(b)                                     In the event
that the time period is extended due to a claimant s failure to submit
information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the
date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until
the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional
information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.  

(c)                                      The Plan

(a)                                      No inquiry or
question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request   

15    

for a review of a denied claim be filed on forms to be furnished by the
Plan Administrator upon request.  

(b)                                     All decisions
on claims and on requests for a review of denied claims shall be made by the
Plan Administrator unless delegated as provided for in the Plan, in which case
references in this Section 9 to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as
references to the Plan Administrator s delegate.  

(c)                                      Claimants may
be represented by a lawyer or other representative at their own expense, but
the Plan Administrator reserves the right to require the claimant to furnish
written authorization and establish reasonable procedures for determining
whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant.  A claimant s representative shall be entitled
to copies of all notices given to the claimant.  

(d)                                     The decision of
the Plan Administrator on a claim and on a request for a review of a denied

at the discretion of the Plan Administrator.  

(e)                                      In connection
with the review of a denied claim, the claimant or the claimant s

within which a benefit determination will be made shall begin to run at the
time a claim or request for review is filed in accordance with the claims
procedures, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a
benefit determination accompanies the filing.  

(g)                                     The claims and
review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards so that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan
documents and, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied
consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.  

(h)                                     The Plan
Administrator may, in its discretion, rely on any applicable statute of
limitation or deadline as a basis for denial of any claim.  

9.3          Limitations
and Exhaustion.   

9.3.1       Claims.     No claim shall be considered
under these administrative procedures unless it is filed with the Plan
Administrator within two (2) years after the Participant knew (or
reasonably should have known) of the general nature of the dispute giving rise
to the claim.  Every untimely claim shall
be denied by the Plan Administrator without regard to the merits of the claim.  

9.3.2           Lawsuits.     No suit may be brought by or on behalf of any
Participant or Beneficiary on any matter pertaining to this Plan unless the
action is commenced in the proper forum within two (2) years from the
earlier of:  

(a)                                      the date the
Participant knew (or reasonably should have known) of the general nature of the
dispute giving rise to the action, or  

16    

(b)                                     the date the
claim was denied.  

9.3.3       Exhaustion
of Remedies.     These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters:  

(a)                                      no Participant
or Beneficiary shall be permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely
claim has been filed under these administrative procedures and these
administrative procedures have been exhausted, and  

(b)                                     determinations
by the Plan Administrator (including determinations as to whether the claim was
timely filed) shall be afforded the maximum deference permitted by law.  

9.3.4       Imputed
Knowledge.     For the purpose of applying the deadlines to
file a claim or a legal action, knowledge of all facts that a Participant knew or
reasonably should have known shall be imputed to every claimant who is or
claims to be a Beneficiary of the Participant or otherwise claims to derive an
entitlement by reference to the Participant for the purpose of applying the
previously specified periods.

SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1          History.     The Company originally established this Plan
(formerly known as the Target Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan II)
effective as of January 1, 1995. 
The Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan intended to replace certain
pension benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees who are officers that cannot be provided under the Pension Plan due
to certain limitations imposed by the Code. 
The Plan provides retirement benefits not provided under the Pension
Plan as a result of deferrals into the Officer EDCP.  The Plan is intended to be a  top hat plan 
as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended from time to time.  Since the
effective date of this Plan, upon a Participant becoming an Officer of the
Company, the benefit due under the Target Corporation SPP V is transferred to
this Plan.  Effective April 30,
2002, for all Officers who were vested in the benefit under this Plan, the
Company transferred the present value of the vested benefit due under this Plan
to the Officer EDCP.  After such
transfer, no benefits were due or payable from this Plan. Further, after the
transfer, the individuals would no longer participate in this Plan or be
eligible for further accruals under this Plan.  
Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as
specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section
409A.  The Plan, which is intended to
comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective January 1,
2009.  This Plan Statement, which was
amended to incorporate the Company s recoupment policy, is effective as of January 13,
2010.

6.2.1       Timing of Benefit
Transfer.   

(a)                                      On or about the
April 30 (or the immediately preceding business day) immediately following
the calendar year in which a Participant is first eligible to participate in
this Plan and has a vested benefit, a Participant will have his or her vested
benefit that is determined under this Plan transferred to the Officer
EDCP.  The transfer will be an amount
equal to the actuarial lump sum present value on March 31 (or the
immediately preceding business day) for the Participant s SPP Benefit accrued
through the preceding December 31. 
In the case of a Participant who is an executive officer, such transfer
will be made and determined on or about the last business day prior to the end
of the Company s fiscal year.  

(b)                                     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of a Termination of Employment as defined under Section 1.2.19(a) or
a Plan termination upon a Change-in-Control under Section 8.3.2 prior to
the date in Section 6.2.1(a), the transfer will be made within 60 days
following such event.  

6.2.2       Benefit to Be
Transferred.     The benefit
transferred to the Officer EDCP is the vested benefit accrued and determined
under this Plan at the time of transfer to the Officer EDCP provided in Section 6.2.1.  The transfer to the Officer EDCP will not
change the payment form, payment timing, or vested status of the benefit
determined under this Plan.  After the
transfer to the Officer EDCP, the benefit will be subject to the terms of the
Officer EDCP, including the acceleration or delay of distributions permitted
thereunder.

SECTION 7   

   NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1              Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation of the Participating Employers
to provide benefits pursuant to this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but
legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to provide such
benefits.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company
or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any
rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts
or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company.  

7.2              Spendthrift Provision.     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2,
no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can
be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to
anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the
possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize
any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other
legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 7.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.  

7.3          Compensation Recovery
(Recoupment)    .     Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan, a Participant who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of
the Company s consolidated financial statements and who becomes subject to the
Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the
Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy )
may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited
and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his
or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company.  

(a)              Any portion of the Participant s benefit resulting
from the receipt of compensation that is subject to recovery under the
Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding
adjustment will be made to the Participant s benefit under this Plan.  

(b)             If a Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is
entitled to receive a distribution under this Plan and the Participant is
subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company
may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any
portion of the Participant s (or the Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net
of state, federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim.  

13    

SECTION 8   

   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1              Adoption.     With the prior
approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become
a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified
copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting the Plan.  

8.2          Amendment.   

8.2.1       General Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or reasonable to comply
with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective to decrease the
benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to any Participant
with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the
date of such amendment.  The Committee is
authorized to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or
desirable by the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan
provided such amendment does not have a material financial impact on the
Company.  Such changes will be considered
an Amendment to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the
Board.  Written notice of any amendment
shall be given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

8.2.2       Amendment to Benefit
of Executive Officer.     Any amendment
to the benefit of an executive officer under this Plan, to the extent approval
of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.  

8.2.3       No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

8.3          Termination.   

8.3.1       General Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate this Plan, provided such termination satisfies the requirements
of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

8.3.2       Plan Termination on
Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and the transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if
and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.  

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding  

14    

of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein
as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or
(ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

15    

SECTION 9   

   CLAIM PROCEDURES   

9.1              Claim Procedures.     Until
modified by the Plan Administrator, the claim and review procedures set forth
in this Section shall be the mandatory claim and review procedures for the
resolution of disputes and disposition of claims filed under the Plan.  An application for a distribution or
withdrawal shall be considered as a claim for the purposes of this Section.  

9.1.1           Initial Claim.     An individual
may, subject to any applicable deadline, file with the Plan Administrator a    written claim for benefits under    the Plan in a    form and manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator.  

(a)                                      If the claim is
denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of
the adverse benefit determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
claim.  

(b)                                     The ninety (90)
day period for making the claim determination may be extended for ninety (90)
days if the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an
extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
ninety (90) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

9.1.2           Notice of Initial Adverse Determination.     A notice of an adverse determination shall
set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:  

(a)                                      the specific

9.1.3           Request for Review.     Within    sixty (60) days after receipt of an
initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant may file with the
Plan Administrator a written request for a review of the adverse determination
and may, in connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records
and other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely.  

9.1.4           Claim on Review.     If the claim,
upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify
the claimant of the adverse benefit determination within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such a request for review.  

16    

(a)                                      The sixty (60)

extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
sixty (60) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

(b)                                     In the event
that the time period is extended due to a claimant s failure to submit
information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the
date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until
the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional
information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.  

(c)                                      The Plan
Administrator s review of a denied claim shall take into account all comments,

the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or
considered in the initial benefit determination.

(a)                                      No inquiry or
question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim be filed on
forms to be furnished by the Plan Administrator upon request.  

(b)                                     All decisions
on claims and on requests for a review of denied claims shall be made by the
Plan Administrator unless delegated as provided for in the Plan, in which case
references in this Section 9 to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as
references to the Plan Administrator s delegate.  

(c)                                      Claimants may
be represented by a lawyer or other representative at their own expense, but
the Plan Administrator reserves the right to require the claimant to furnish
written authorization and establish reasonable procedures for determining
whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant.  A claimant s representative shall be entitled
to copies of all notices given to the claimant.  

(d)                                     The decision of
the Plan Administrator on a claim and on a request for a review of a denied
claim may be provided to the claimant in electronic form instead of in writing
at the discretion of the Plan Administrator.  

(e)                                      In connection
with the review of a denied claim, the claimant or the claimant s

(f)                                        The time period
within which a benefit determination will be made shall begin to run at the
time a claim or request for review is filed in accordance with the claims
procedures, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a
benefit determination accompanies the filing.  

(g)                                     The claims and
review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards so that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan
documents and, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied
consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.  

(h)                                     The Plan
Administrator may, in its discretion, rely on any applicable statute of

9.3          Limitations
and Exhaustion.   

9.3.1       Claims.     No claim shall be considered
under these administrative procedures unless it is filed with the Plan
Administrator within two (2) years after the Participant knew (or   

18    

reasonably should have known) of the general nature
of the dispute giving rise to the claim. 
Every untimely claim shall be denied by the Plan Administrator without
regard to the merits of the claim.  

9.3.2           Lawsuits.     No suit may be brought by or on behalf of any
Participant or Beneficiary on any matter pertaining to this Plan unless the
action is commenced in the proper forum within two (2) years from the

(a)                                      the date the
Participant knew (or reasonably should have known) of the general nature of the
dispute giving rise to the action, or  

(b)                                     the date the
claim was denied.  

9.3.3       Exhaustion
of Remedies.     These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters:  

(a)                                      no Participant
or Beneficiary shall be permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely
claim has been filed under these administrative procedures and these
administrative procedures have been exhausted, and  

(b)                                     determinations
by the Plan Administrator (including determinations as to whether the claim was
timely filed) shall be afforded the maximum deference permitted by law.  

9.3.4       Imputed
Knowledge.     For the purpose of applying the deadlines to
file a claim or a legal action, knowledge of all facts that a Participant knew
or reasonably should have known shall be imputed to every claimant who is or
claims to be a Beneficiary of the Participant or otherwise claims to derive an
entitlement by reference to the Participant for the purpose of applying the
previously specified periods.

SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1                  History.     The Company originally established this Plan
(formerly known as the Target Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan III)
effective as of January 1, 1995. 
The Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan intended to provide certain
pension benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees who are officers that cannot be provided under the Pension Plan due
to certain limitations imposed by the Code. 
The Plan is intended to be a  top hat plan  as defined under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to
time.   Effective as of November 8,
2000, no additional Officers could become eligible to participate in this
Plan.  Effective April 30, 2002, for
all Officers who had attained age 55, the Company transferred the present value
of the vested benefit due under this Plan to the Officer EDCP.  After such transfer, no benefits were due or
payable from this Plan. Further, after the transfer, the individuals would no
longer participate in this Plan or be eligible for further accruals under this
Plan.  Effective January 1, 2005
(and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in
compliance with Code section 409A.  The
Plan, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and
restated effective January 1, 2009. 
This Plan Statement, which was amended to include the Company s
recoupment policy, is effective January 13, 2010.

following the calendar year in which a Participant is first eligible for a
benefit under this Plan, a Participant will have his or her benefit determined
under this Plan and transferred to the Officer EDCP.  The transfer will be   an amount equal
to the actuarial lump sum present value of the Participant s benefit accrued
under this Plan.  

(b)                                     Notwithstanding

permitted thereunder.

SECTION 6 
NATURE OF INTEREST   

6.1                  Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation of the Participating Employers
to provide benefits pursuant to this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but
legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to provide such
benefits.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company
or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any
rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts
or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company.  

6.2                  Spendthrift Provision.     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.2,
no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can
be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to
anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the
possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize
any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other
legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 6.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.  

6.3                  Compensation
Recovery (Recoupment)    .     Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan, a Participant who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of
the Company s consolidated financial statements and who becomes subject to the
Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the
Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy )
may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited
and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his
or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company.  

(a)              Any portion of the Participant s benefit resulting
from the receipt of compensation that is subject to recovery under the
Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding
adjustment will be made to the Participant s benefit under this Plan.  

(b)             If a Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is
entitled to receive a distribution under this Plan and the Participant is
subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company
may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any
portion of the Participant s (or the Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net
of state, federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim.

Rule.     The Board may at any time

this Plan; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or reasonable to comply
with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective to decrease the
benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to any Participant
with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the
date of such amendment.  The Committee is
authorized to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or
desirable by the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan

of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.

or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.

Termination on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will

Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding  

11    

of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein
as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or
(ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP.

modified by the Plan Administrator, the claim and review procedures set forth
in this Section shall be the mandatory claim and review procedures for the

8.1.1               Initial Claim.     An individual

denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of
the adverse benefit determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
claim.  

(b)                                     The ninety (90)
day period for making the claim determination may be extended for ninety (90)
days if the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an
extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
ninety (90) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

8.1.2               Notice of Initial Adverse Determination.     A notice of an adverse determination shall
set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:

initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant may file with the
Plan Administrator a written request for a review of the adverse determination
and may, in connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records
and other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely.  

8.1.4               Claim on Review.     If the claim,
upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify
the claimant of the adverse benefit determination within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such a request for review.

that the time period is extended due to a claimant s failure to submit
information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the
date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until
the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional
information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.

question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim be filed on
forms to be furnished by the Plan Administrator upon request.

review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards so that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan
documents and, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied
consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.  

(h)                                     The Plan

of Remedies.     These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters:  

(a)                                      no Participant
or Beneficiary shall be permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely

administrative procedures have been exhausted, and  

(b)                                     determinations

Exhibit 10(H)   

TARGET CORPORATION  

  OFFICER DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN  

ARTICLE 1  

  PURPOSE  

The purpose of this Target Corporation Officer
Deferred Compensation Plan, formerly known as the Target Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan   Senior Management Group, 
(the  Plan ) is to provide a means whereby Target Corporation (the  Company )
may afford financial security to a select group of employees who are in the
Senior Management Group of the Company and its subsidiaries and who have
rendered and continue to render valuable services to the Company or its
subsidiaries and who make an important contribution towards the Company s
continued growth and success, by providing for additional future compensation
so that such employees may be retained and their productive efforts
encouraged.  Participants ceased to be
eligible to defer Earnings into the Plan after December 31, 1996.    The Plan, which is intended
to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective January 1,
2009.  This Plan document, which was
amended to incorporate the Company s recoupment policy, is effective January 13,

or if no successor index exists, such other index as selected by the Committee
as most closely replicates the measure produced by said Moody index) for the
month of June for the year preceding the subject Plan Year to which the
Declared Rate shall apply, said rate of return to be rounded to the nearest
..10% of said reported rate, to which percentage rate shall be added six (6) percentage
points (e.g. an index of  7.16% rounded
to 7.20%  plus 6% equals a 13.2%  Declared
Rate ).   Provided however , if any
tax or insurance change shall occur which in the reasoned judgment of the
Committee shall have an ongoing adverse economic effect on the underlying COLI
financing assumptions related to the Plan, then the Committee may adjust said

twelve percent (12%) minimum referenced in the first paragraph hereof.

Employee  if on his or her Termination of Employment, the Company or other
Affiliate has stock that is traded on an established securities market within
the meaning of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B) and such individual is a  key
employee  (defined below).  For this
purpose, an individual is a  key employee  during the 12-month period beginning
on April 1 immediately following the calendar year in which the individual
was employed by the Company and other Affiliates, and satisfied, at any time
within such calendar year, the requirements of Code section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii) or

Termination of Employment.   

(a)                                      For purposes of

of Employment  means a severance of a Participant s employment relationship
with the Employer and all other Affiliates, for any reason.  

(b)                                     For purposes of
determining when a distribution will be made under the Plan, a  Termination of
Employment  will be deemed to occur if, based on the relevant facts and
circumstances to the Participant, the Employer, all other Affiliates, and Participant
reasonably anticipate that   the level of bona fide future   services to be
performed by the Participant for the Employer and all other Affiliates will
permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of   bona fide   services
performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period.  

(c)                                      A bona fide
leave of absence that is six months or less, or during which an individual
retains a reemployment right, will not cause a Termination of Employment.  In the case of a leave of absence without a right
of reemployment that exceeds the time periods described in this paragraph, a
Termination of Employment will be deemed to occur once the leave of absence
exceeds six months.  

(d)                                     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Termination of Employment shall not occur unless such
termination also qualifies as a  separation from service,  as defined under
Code section 409A and related guidance thereunder.

ARTICLE 3  

  ADMINISTRATION OF
THE PLAN  

A Committee shall be appointed
by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to administer the Plan and to
establish, adopt or revise such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.  The Committee shall have discretionary authority
to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the
Plan.  Interpretations of the Plan by the
Committee shall be conclusive.  Members
of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan while serving as
members of the Committee, but a member of the Committee shall not vote or act
upon any matter which relates solely to such member s interest in the Plan as a
Participant.  

ARTICLE 4  

  PARTICIPATION  

4.1            Election to
Participate.   Effective for Plan
Years beginning on and after January 1, 1997, Participants ceased to be
eligible to defer Earnings into this Plan. 
For Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 1997, any Employee who
is a member of the Senior Management Group of the Company may enroll in the
Plan by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement or
authorization form with the Committee. Pursuant to said Enrollment Agreement or
authorization form, the Employee shall irrevocably designate a dollar amount by
which the aggregate Earnings of such Participant would be reduced over one (1) or
four (4) Plan Years next following the execution of the Enrollment
Agreement (the  Benefit Deferral Period ), provided, however, that:  

(a)            Minimum
Deferral.   The reduction for any Plan
Year shall not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00)  

(b)            Reduction
in Earnings.   

(i)             In General.   Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1,
the Earnings of the Participant for each of the Plan Years in the Benefit
Deferral Period shall be reduced by the amount specified in the Enrollment
Agreement (including any authorization form) applicable to such Plan Year.  

(ii)            Accelerated Reduction.   A Participant may elect in a written notice
with the consent of the Committee to increase the amount of the reduction of
Earnings otherwise provided for by Section 4.1(b)(i) for any of the
Plan Years remaining in the Benefit Deferral Period, provided, however, that
any such increase in the reduction of Earnings for any remaining Plan Years in
the Benefit Deferral Period shall not increase the Cumulative Deferral Amount,
but shall act to shorten the length of the Benefit Deferral Period.  

(c)            Maximum
Reduction in Earnings.   A Participant
may not elect a Cumulative Deferral Amount or an increase in reduction of
Earnings pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(ii), or any combination of the two,
that would cause the aggregate total reduction in Earnings in any Plan Year to
exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the base pay and one hundred percent (100%)
of the incentive pay payable during such Plan Year up to a total of $250,000
per year plus the amount of any payout made pursuant to Section 5.4, or
such greater percent of base   

4    

pay and/or incentive pay or greater total amount as the Committee may
permit in its sole discretion.  In the
event that a Participant elects a Cumulative Deferral Amount or increase in
reduction of Earnings that would violate the limitation described in this
paragraph (c), the election shall be valid except that the Cumulative Deferral
Amount or increase in reduction of Earnings so elected shall automatically be
reduced to comply with such limitation, whichever is most appropriate in the
sole discretion of the Committee.  

4.2            Deferral
Accounts.   The Committee shall
establish and maintain a separate Deferral Account for each Participant. The
amount by which a Participant s Earnings are reduced pursuant to Section 4.1
shall be credited by the Employer to the Participant s Deferral Account on the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month in which such Earnings would otherwise have
been paid.  The Participant s Deferral
Account shall be credited with the annual SRSP lost Matching Allocation on January 15
following the year of the lost Matching Allocation.  Effective for Plan Years beginning on and
after January 1, 1997, Participants ceased to be eligible for the annual
SRSP lost Matching Allocation.  Such
Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the
Employer to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary pursuant to this
Plan.  

(a)            Normal
and Early Retirement Interest.   Each
Deferral Account of a Participant who retires as a Normal or Early Retirement
shall be deemed to bear interest, in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1,
from the date such Deferral Account was established through the date of
commencement of payment of the Normal or Early Retirement Benefit at a rate
equal to the Declared Rate which is announced by the Committee for each Plan
Year.  Following the date of commencement
of payment of the Normal or Early Retirement Benefit, a Participant s Deferral
Account shall be deemed to bear interest on the balance of such Deferral
Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.  

(b)            Other
Interest.   In the case of any
Termination of Employment other than by Normal or Early Retirement or upon the
Participant s termination of enrollment in this Plan pursuant to Section 5.2(b),
the Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest from the
date such Deferral Account was established through the date of the earlier of
Termination of Employment or termination of enrollment in this Plan under Section 5.2(c) on
the balance in such Deferral Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1,
except that the interest rate used to calculate interest earned in the Deferral
Account shall be ten percent (10%) per annum, provided, however, that if more
than five (5) years have elapsed since the first day of the Benefit
Deferral Period, the Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear
interest from the date such Deferral Account was established through the date
of the earlier of Termination of Employment or termination of enrollment in
this Plan on the balance in such Deferral Account at a rate equal to the
Declared Rate which is announced by the Committee for each Plan Year, in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 1. 
Following the earlier of the date of commencement of payment of the
Termination Benefit or the date of termination of enrollment in this Plan, a
Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest on the balance
in such Deferral Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1, if the
Participant is in Active Status with respect to the Deferral Account or in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2, if the Participant is in Pay Status
with respect to the Deferral Account. 
However, in either case the interest rate used to calculate interest
earned in the Deferral Account shall be twelve percent (12%) per annum.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, if a Participant has begun receiving benefits under this Plan and
the calculation of future benefits, using the method of calculation set forth
on Appendix A causes a reduction in benefits, the future   

5    

payments shall be made in accordance with the method
used at the time of the Participant s initial payment.  

4.3            Rollover Deferred
Compensation Account.   In its sole
discretion, the Committee may permit a Participant to make a special rollover
election to transfer any amounts which were previously deferred under the
Company s existing deferred compensation plans to this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
special rollover elections or transfers to this Plan shall be permitted after December 31,
2008.  

In such event, the Committee shall establish and maintain a separate
Rollover Deferral Account for each Participant who makes a rollover transfer to
this Plan.  Such Rollover Deferral
Account shall be deemed to bear interest at the same rate and subject to the
same conditions as other Deferral Accounts pursuant to Section 4.2.  Each Participant who makes a rollover
transfer to a Rollover Deferral Account shall be treated for purposes of
determining benefits under the Plan as having a separate Cumulative Deferral
Amount and Deferral Account which shall initially be in the amount of the
rollover transfer.  A Participant who
makes a rollover transfer shall be deemed to waive all rights under the Company s
existing deferred compensation plans from which rollover transfers are made
with respect to the amounts transferred to this Plan, including the right to
make elections regarding the time or manner of payment as permitted thereunder.
Rollover transfers shall be subject to the minimum deferral amount set forth in
Section 4.1(a), but shall not be subject to any maximum deferral
limitation.  

4.4            Valuation of
Accounts.   The value of a Deferral
Account as of any date shall equal the amounts theretofore credited to such
account less any payments debited to such account plus the interest deemed to
be earned on such account in accordance with Section 4.2.  Interest shall be credited in accordance with
Appendix A.  

4.5            Statement of
Accounts.   The Committee shall submit
to each Participant, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of
each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable
setting forth the balance standing to the credit of each Participant in his
Deferral Account.  

4.6            No Future
Deferrals.    No Employee or
Participant can make additional deferrals into the Plan.  

ARTICLE 5  

  BENEFITS  

5.1            Normal or Early Retirement.   Upon a Participant s Normal or Early
Retirement, the payment of benefits shall commence on the first day of the
month following such Termination of Employment, or following such later date
which the Participant elected in his Enrollment Agreement (including any
authorization form).  A Participant may
elect in his Enrollment Agreement (including any authorization form) to have
payments commence from one (1) to ten (10) years following Termination
of Employment, but not later than age 65 (or five (5) years after the
first day of the Benefit Deferral Period, if later).  

(a)            Single
Participant.   In the case of a
Participant who is single when payments commence, the Employer shall make
periodic payments to the Participant in an   

6    

amount in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B., for the life
of the Participant, but not less than fifteen (15) years.  The payments shall be the actuarial equivalent
of the aggregate of the Participant s Deferral Account at the time payments
commence and the interest that will accrue on the unpaid balance in such
Deferral Account during the payment period pursuant to Section 4.2(a).  The payment amount will be redetermined
annually to reflect the changes in the Declared Rate.  

(b)            Married
Participant.   In the case of a
Participant who is married when payments commence, the Employer shall make
actuarially reduced payments in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B.,
to the Participant for his life and thereafter, if the Participant is survived
by a spouse who was married to the Participant when Normal or Early Retirement
Benefit payments commenced, shall continue to make payments to the Participant s
spouse for his life, with payments to be made for an aggregate period of not
less than fifteen (15) years.  The
payments shall be the actuarial equivalent of the payments which would be made
to the Participant pursuant to Section 5.1(a) if he were single.  The monthly amount of payments will be
redetermined annually to reflect changes in the Declared Rate.  

5.2                                      Termination Benefit.   

(a)            Terminations
of Employment.   If a Participant has
a Termination of Employment for any reason other than death or Normal or Early
Retirement, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in one immediate lump sum
an amount (the  Termination Benefit ) equal to the value of the Deferral
Account as of the date of payment and such Participant shall be entitled to no
further benefits under this Plan.  Upon
Termination of Employment (as defined in paragraph (a) of that definition)
the Participant shall immediately cease to be eligible for any benefits under
the Plan other than the Termination Benefit. 
Payment will be made as soon as practicable but not more than 90 days
following the Participant s Termination of Employment or at such later time
provided in Section 5.3.  Except as
provided in paragraph (b) below, no other benefit shall be payable to
either the Participant or any Beneficiary of such Participant.  

(b)            Certain
Terminations of Employment.   If a
Participant has a Termination of Employment after attaining age 50, but prior
to attaining age 55, and the Participant has worked for the Company for at
least 10 years, and has received an ICP Contract under the Company s Income
Continuance Policy that is signed by Participant and Company and not rescinded,
the Participant will be entitled to an additional, immediate lump sum
distribution equal to the difference between:  

(i) The actuarial equivalent lump sum value of
the periodic payments scheduled to be made to the Participant determined in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B for the life of the Participant,
but not less than fifteen (15) years payments; and  

(ii)  The value of the Participant s Deferral
Account.  

(c)            Termination of Enrollment in Plan.   With the written consent of the Committee, a
Participant may terminate his enrollment in the Plan by filing with the
Committee a written request to terminate enrollment.  The Committee will consent to the termination
of a Participant s enrollment in the Plan in the event of an unforeseeable
financial emergency of the Participant. 
An unforeseeable financial emergency shall mean an unexpected need for
cash   

7    

arising from an illness,
casualty loss, sudden financial reversal or other such unforeseeable
occurrence,   but only if and to the extent such unforeseeable
emergency constitutes an  unforeseeable emergency  under Code section 409A.   
Cash needs arising from foreseeable events such as the purchase of a
house or education expenses for children shall not be considered to be the
result of an unforeseeable financial emergency. 
Upon termination of enrollment, no further reductions shall be made in
the Participant s Earnings pursuant to his Enrollment Agreement, and the
Participant shall immediately cease to be eligible for any benefits under the
Plan other than the Termination Benefit. 
No other benefit shall be payable to either the Participant or any
Beneficiary of such Participant.  In its
sole discretion, to the extent necessary to relieve the unforeseeable
emergency, the Committee may pay such benefit on a date earlier than the
Participant s Termination of Employment with the Employer.  Following termination of enrollment in the
Plan, a Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest on the
balance in such Deferral Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1,
except that the interest rate used to calculate interest earned in the Deferral
Account shall be twelve percent (12%) per annum.  

5.3                Lump Sum Election.   Other provisions of Section 5.1 and Section 5.2
notwithstanding, if a Participant in his Enrollment Agreement (including any
authorization form) has elected a lump sum payment to be made after his
Termination of Employment, the amount of his Deferral Account (including
interest) for the Benefit Deferral Period covered by that Agreement shall be
paid to the Participant in a lump sum at the time specified in that Agreement.  

5.4                [Deleted]   

5.5            Survivor Benefits .  Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall apply
to Participants whose death occurs prior to Termination of Employment.  Paragraph (c) reflects the survivor
benefit rules that apply to annuity benefits that are payable on account
of a Participant s Termination of Employment.  

(a)        If a Participant dies prior to his or
her Termination of Employment prior to attaining age 55, the Employer will pay
to the Participant s Beneficiary an annual benefit for the greater of:  

(i)  ten (10) years,
or  

(ii)  until
the Participant would otherwise have attained age 65,  

in an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Cumulative Deferral Amount; provided, however, if
the Committee determines that installment distribution of the Participant s
Deferral Account (determined below) would produce a greater benefit, such
Deferral Account balance shall be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in
equal annual installments in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.C.2,
but over the period specified above. 
Payments will commence immediately (within 60 days) following the
Participant s death, and will be made each subsequent anniversary of the
Participant s death.  

(b)        If a Participant dies prior to
Termination of Employment after attaining age 55, the Employer will pay to the
Participant s Beneficiary the benefit that such Participant would have received
had the Participant retired on the day prior to such Participant s death.  Payments will commence immediately (within 60
days) following the Participant s death, and will be made each subsequent
anniversary of the Participant s death. 
Additionally, if the present   

8    

value of the benefit
described in this Section 5.5(b) is less than the present value of
the benefit described in Section 5.5(a), using in each case twelve percent
(12%) as the discount factor, then the Beneficiary shall receive an immediate
lump sum payment equal to difference of such present values.  

(c)        If a Participant (who was unmarried at
the commencement of the payment of any Early or Normal Retirement Benefit, or
whose spouse who was married to the Participant at the time of commencement of
payment of any Early or Normal Retirement Benefit predeceases the Participant)
dies after the commencement of the payment of any Early or Normal Retirement
Benefit, the Employer will pay to the Participant s Beneficiary the remaining
installments of any such benefit for the balance of the fifteen (15) years
minimum payment period.  If a spouse who
was married to the Participant at the time of commencement of payment of the
Early or Normal Retirement Benefit survives beyond such fifteen (15) years
minimum payment period, payments shall continue to be made to the spouse until
the spouse s death.  If the spouse who
was married to the Participant at the time of commencement of payment of the
Early or Normal Retirement Benefit survives the Participant, but does not
survive past the fifteen (15) years minimum payment period, the Employer will
pay to the Participant s Beneficiary the remaining installments of any such
benefit for the balance of the fifteen (15) years minimum payment period.  In computing any benefits to be paid
following the Participant s death pursuant to this paragraph (c), the
Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest following the
Participant s death on the balance in such Deferral Account annually in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B.  

5.6            Small Benefit.     Subject to Section 5.8,
in the event that the vested Deferral Account balance under the Plan of a
Participant who has died or experienced a Termination of Employment is less
than the applicable dollar amount under Code section 402(g)(1)(B) for that
Plan Year as of the date on which the Company makes such determinations, the
Company reserves the right to have the Participant s entire Deferral Account
paid in the form of a single lump sum payment provided the Company s exercise
of discretion complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg. Sec.
1.409A-3(j)(4)(v).  

5.7            Withholding.   To the extent required by the law in effect
at the time payments are made, the Employer shall withhold from payments made
hereunder the minimum taxes that the Employer reasonably determines is required
to be withheld by the federal or any state or local government.  

5.8            Delay in Payment Required by Code Section 409A.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 5,
if a Participant is a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any
distributions arising on account of the Participant s Termination of Employment
(other than on account of death) shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months
have elapsed since such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if
earlier, upon the date of the Participant s death).  Any payments that were otherwise payable
during the six-month suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence,
will be paid within 60 days after the end of such six-month suspension period  .  During the six-month suspension period,
delayed payments will earn interest at the Declared Rate.  

5.9            Acceleration of Distributions.   The Committee in its sole discretion may
exercise discretion to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this
Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A.  

9    

5.10          Delay of Distributions.   The Committee in its sole discretion may
exercise discretion to delay the distribution of any payment under this Plan to
the extent allowed under Code section 409A, including, but not limited to, as
necessary to maximize the Company s tax deductions as allowed pursuant to Code
section 162(m) or to avoid violation of federal securities or other
applicable law.  

ARTICLE 6  

  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION  

Each Participant shall
have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as Beneficiary
or Beneficiaries to whom payment under this Plan shall be made in the event of
the Participant s death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of
the benefits due under the Plan.  Each
Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with
the Committee during the Participant s lifetime on a form prescribed by the
Committee.  

The filing of a new
Beneficiary designation form will cancel all Beneficiary designations
previously filed.  Any finalized divorce
or marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to
the date of filing of a Beneficiary designation form shall revoke such
designation unless in the case of divorce the previous spouse was not
designated as Beneficiary and unless in the case of marriage the Participant s
new spouse had previously been designated as Beneficiary.  The spouse of a married Participant domiciled
in a community property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of
Beneficiary or Beneficiaries other than the spouse.  

If a Participant fails to
designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if his Beneficiary designation is
revoked by marriage, divorce, or otherwise without execution of a new
designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or
die prior to complete distribution of the Participant s benefits, then the
Committee shall direct the distribution of such benefits to the Participant s
estate.  

ARTICLE 7  

  AMENDMENT AND
TERMINATION OF PLAN  

7.1            Amendment .  The Board of Directors of the Company may at
any time amend the Plan, in whole or in part for any reason, including but not
limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to
terminate the Plan for future deferrals (excluding from such power to terminate
future deferrals those future deferrals provided for in Section 5.4  Early
Payout Option ); provided,   however, that   no amendment shall be effective to
decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under the Plan to any
Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing)
prior to the date of such amendment. 
Written notice of any amendment shall be given each Participant then
participating in the Plan. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board authorizes the Committee to amend
the Plan to make any other amendments to this Plan deemed necessary or
desirable by the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan
provided such amendment does not have a material financial impact on the
Company.  Such changes will be considered
an Amendment to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the
Board.  

10    

7.2                                      Termination of Plan   . 
The Plan shall terminate only under the following circumstances.  

(a)                                       General Rule   .    To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  Upon any such termination of the Plan, the   Employer will pay the respective
Participant the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts in an immediate
lump sum, determined as if the Participant had a Termination of Employment on
the date of such termination of the Plan as provided under Section 5.2(a) hereof.  

(b)                                      Plan
Termination and Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control, as defined in Section 7.3
hereof, the Plan will terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will
be accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section 7.2(b) hereof.  

(i)                                         The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 7.3(a), and (ii) a funding of the
trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan
termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective
date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated
as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to
irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its
failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such
date.  

(ii)                                      The
determination by the Board under paragraph (b)(i) constitutes a
determination that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code
section 409A, including an agreement by the Company that it will take such
additional action or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to
satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under
paragraph (iii) below.  

(iii)                                   In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as

the outstanding voting stock (or comparable equity interests) of the surviving
or acquiring entity (other than a direct or indirect parent entity of the
surviving or acquiring entity, that, after giving effect to the Business
Combination, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the outstanding
voting stock (or comparable equity interests) of the surviving or acquiring

APPENDIX
A   

  Section 1  

Participant Deferral Account Interest Crediting
While in Active Status Assuming No Further Deferrals   

A.               A Participant shall receive interest credited monthly
equal to the Participant s beginning-of-year (BOY) Deferral Account balance
times the Declared Rate divided by twelve:  

Interest crediting occurs
up to the day the Participant begins to receive annuity payments from the Plan.  

Example of interest
credited calculation   

B.                 A participant s Deferral Account balance shall be
increased each month by taking the beginning-of-month (BOM) balance plus
interest credited for the month to equal the end-of-month (EOM) balance.  

BOM balance + monthly
interest credited = EOM balance  

Example of monthly
account growth

Section 2:   

   Interest Crediting, Deferral Account Balances, and
Payments While in Pay Status   

A.                                       Definition of Variables for Participant
Payment Calculation  

1.                    n  = number of payments expected to be made to a
Participant and spouse. The number of expected payments shall be determined by:
(1) The ages of the Participant and spouse at the time annuity payments
first begin. (2) The number of years that the Participant and spouse are
expected to live, as determined by an actuarially-based mortality table
selected by the Committee. (3) The frequency of payments made to the
Participant. This frequency shall be determined by the payroll procedures of
the Company s operating division responsible for administering the Participant s
payments.  

Example of number of expected payments (assuming
payments to begin on 10/1/99)   

2.                    i  = interest rate per payment period such that when
compounded over the entire year equals the Declared Rate.  

i  shall be expressed either as a weekly or monthly
interest rate, depending on the frequency of annuity payments made by the
operating division administering the Participant s payments. If weekly,  i  is
the interest rate that, when compounded over 52 periods, will equal the
Declared Rate. If monthly,  i  is the interest rate that, when compounded over
12 periods, will equal the Declared Rate.  

Example of weekly and monthly interest rates   

Declared Rate = 13.7%  

  Weekly  i  = (1.137)  1/52   = .002472 or .2472%  

  Monthly  i  = (1.137)  1/12   = .010757 or 1.0757%  

3.                   The beginning-of-period balance (BOP balance) is the
Participant s Deferral Account balance at any time before credited interest has
been added for the period and payments have been subtracted for the period.  

End-of-period balance (EOP balance) is the Participant s
Deferral Account balance at any point in time after credited interest has been
added for the period and payments have been subtracted for the period.  

Example of EOP balance calculation   

EOP balance = BOP balance + interest crediting -
payment  

16    

B.                 Payments  

1.                   Calculation of payments  

At the beginning of each year (or at the beginning of
a month when a Participant s Deferral Account is first transferred from active
status to payment status), a payment shall be calculated for each Participant
who has a Deferral Account that is in the payment status. The periodicity of
payments shall depend on the payroll procedures of the operating division
administering the Participant s payments. The amount of the payment shall be
effective for that calendar year (or portion of the calendar year).  

The calculation of the payment amount is based on the
present value of an annuity formula. Specifically, the payment is given by:  

Example of a calculation
with monthly payments   

n = 476 months  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Payment = $5,411.73  

Example of a calculation
with weekly payments   

n = 2,070 weeks  

  Weekly i = 0.2472%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Payment = $1,243.50  

2.                   Interest Crediting for Payments  

Interest crediting shall be calculated every payment
period, with the interest amount equal to the beginning-of-period Deferral
Account balance times the periodic interest rate  

Example of interest
crediting calculation (assuming monthly payments and a 13.7% Declared Rate)   

BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  Interest crediting = $500,000.00      
..010757 = $5,378.50  

17    

3.                   Amortization of Participant Deferral Account Balances  

Participant Deferral Account balances shall be
amortized over the remaining number of expected 
payment periods by adding to the beginning-of-period balance the
interest credits earned during the period less the payment made for the period
to produce an end-of-period Deferral Account balance.  

Example of Deferral
Account balance amortization (assuming monthly payments and a 13.7% Declared
Rate)   

BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  Interest crediting = $5,378.50  

  Payment = $5,411.73  

  EOP balance = $500,000.00 + $5,378.50   -  
$5,411.73 = $499,966.77  

C.                 Installment Termination Payments  

1.                   [Intentionally left blank.]  

2.                   The four equal annual installment payments are
determined by using the present value of an annuity formula referenced in Section 2.B.1.
of this Appendix. The interest rate used in calculating the four payments shall
be 12%.  

Example of a four-year annual installment payout of a
Deferral Account balance  

n = 4  

  Annual i = 12%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Annual installment
payments = $164,617.22

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

SECTION 1   

   INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1          Name of Plan;
History.    This Plan (formerly known as the  Target Corporation
SMG Executive Officer Deferred Compensation Plan) is a non-qualified, unfunded
plan established for the purpose of allowing a select group of management or
highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of income. This Plan was
originally adopted effective as of January 1, 1997 and was amended at
various times thereafter. Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this
Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received
credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the
supplemental pension plans maintained by the Company. Each subsequent April,
the Participant receives annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credits equal to the
change in value of his or her benefit under the supplemental pension plans. Effective
July 31, 2002, this program was extended to include all officers of the
Company. Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were
members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under
this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the Company s ESBP.
Each subsequent April, Participants received annual credits equal to the change
in value of his or her benefit under the ESBP. Effective October 28, 2005,
all officers who had not previously received ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits,
received a one-time transfer of the present value of their benefit under the
ESBP. As of January 28, 2006, a one-time ESBP credit was made to certain
executive committee members and no subsequent ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits
were made to those receiving the one-time ESBP credit. From time to time,
certain participants in the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan  
Senior Management Group ( ODCP ) and the Company negotiated to transfer the
economic value of their benefit under ODCP to this Plan. Officers eligible to
receive performance share awards granted in the fiscal years ending February 1,
2003 and January 31, 2004 had an opportunity to defer receipt of the value
of the earned performance shares into this Plan at the end of the performance
period. The performance period for the shares granted in 2003 ended February 3,
2007. The performance period for the shares granted in 2004 ended February 2,
2008. Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as specifically
provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section 409A. Effective
January 29, 2006, members of the Company s executive committee ceased to
be eligible to receive enhanced earnings on their account balances. The Plan,
which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective
January 1, 2009. This Plan Statement, which was amended to incorporate the
Company s recoupment policy, is effective January 13, 2010.

days after the end of such six-month suspension period.  

6.4                  Distribution
on Account of Death.     Upon the death
of a Participant, the Participant s Account balance will be paid to the
Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum within 90 days following the
Participant s death.  

6.5                  Distribution
on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency.   

6.5.1               When
Available.     A Participant
may receive a distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which
shall be deemed to include the deferral that would have been made but for the
cancellation under Section 6.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines
that such distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the
conditions in Section 6.5.2 have been fulfilled.  To receive such a distribution, the
Participant must request a distribution by filing an application with the Plan
Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan
Administrator may require.  In the
application, the Participant shall specify the basis for the distribution and
the dollar amount to be distributed.  If
such request is approved by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made
in a lump sum payment within 60 days following the approval by the Plan
Administrator of the completed application.  

6.5.2               Limitations   .  The amount that may be distributed with
respect to a Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts
necessary to satisfy the emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes
reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into
account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved
through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation
of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would
not itself cause severe financial hardship), and/or cancellation of deferrals
pursuant to Section 6.5.3, provided the determination of such limitation
is consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii).  

6.5.3               Cancellation
of Deferral Elections.     As provided by Section 2.12,
in the event of a distribution under Section 6.5.1 the Plan Administrator
will cancel the Participant s deferral elections for the balance of the
applicable Plan Year.  

6.6                  Designation
of Beneficiaries.   

6.6.1               Right
to Designate or Revoke.   

(a)               Each Participant may
designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary Beneficiaries to
receive all or a specified part of such Participant s vested Account in the
event of such Participant s death.  If
fewer than all designated primary or secondary Beneficiaries predecease the
Participant, then the amount of such predeceased Beneficiary s portion shall be
allocated to the remaining primary or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may
be.  

(b)               The Participant may change
or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent
from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other person.  

(c)               No such designation, change
or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed with the Plan
Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the Participant s lifetime.  

23    

6.6.2               Failure
of Designation   .  If a
Participant:  

(a)               fails to designate a
Beneficiary,  

(b)               designates a Beneficiary and
thereafter revokes such designation without naming another Beneficiary, or  

(c)               designates one or more
Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive the
Participant, such Participant s vested Account, shall be payable to the first
class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries:  

Participant s
surviving spouse 
Representative of Participant s estate  

6.6.3               Disclaimers
by Beneficiaries   .  A
Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased
Participant s vested Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the
Plan Rules.  

6.6.4               Special
Rules.     Unless the Participant has
otherwise specified in the Participant s Beneficiary designation, the following
rules shall apply:  

(a)               If there is not sufficient
evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the time of
the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary was not
living at the time of the death of the Participant.  

(b)               The automatic Beneficiaries
specified in Section 6.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated by the
Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant s death (subject
to Section 6.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the Participant but
dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary hereunder, such
remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of such Beneficiary s
estate.  

(c)               If the Participant
designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant s spouse on the
date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or both, the
dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage between the
Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such designation.  The foregoing shall not prevent the
Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a form that is
both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan Administrator (i) after
the date of the legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and
such former spouse and (ii) during the Participant s lifetime.  

(d)               A finalized marriage (other
than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the date of filing
of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation unless the
Participant s new spouse had previously been designated as the Beneficiary.  

(e)               Any designation of a
nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of
relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard  

24    

to whether the relationship
to the Participant exists either then or at the Participant s death.  

(f)                Any designation of a
Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be
effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship
to the Participant at the Participant s death.  

6.7                  Facility
of Payment.   

6.7.1               Legal
Disability.     In case of the
legal disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any
payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall
be advised of the existence of such condition:  

(a)               to the duly appointed
guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual, or  

(b)               to a person or institution
entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disable
Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has satisfied
the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best interest and
assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that no prior
claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator
or other legal representative of such individual.  

6.7.2               Discharge
of Liability.     Any payment
made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall
constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the
Participating Employers under this Plan.  

6.8                  Tax
Withholding.     The
Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall
withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or
other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under
applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan.  All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be
reduced by the amount to be withheld.  

6.9                  Payments
Upon Rehire.     If a
Participant who is receiving installment payments or due a deferred lump sum
payment under this Plan is rehired, the payments will continue in accordance
with the prior distribution elections.  

6.10                Application
for Distribution.     A Participant
may be required to make application to receive payment and to complete other
forms and furnish other documentation required by the Plan Administrator.  Distribution shall not be made to any
Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an application for benefits
in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and such application shall have
been approved by the Plan Administrator and the Plan Administrator has
determined that the applicant is entitled to payment.  

6.11                Acceleration
of Distributions.     The Plan
Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion to accelerate the
distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code
section 409A.  

6.12                Delay
of Distributions.     The Plan
Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion to delay the
distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code
section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the
Company s tax   

25    

deductions
as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to avoid violation of
federal securities or other applicable law.  

26    

SECTION 7   

   SOURCE OF PAYMENTS; NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1                  Source
of Payments.   

7.1.1               General
Assets.     Each Participating Employer
will pay, from its general assets, the distribution of the Participant s
Account under Section 6, and all costs, charges and expenses relating
thereto.  

7.1.2               Trust.     Upon a Change-in-Control
that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 8.3.2, the trustee of
the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the
Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer s obligations to make
distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of
the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the
Participating Employer.  

7.2                  Unfunded
Obligation.     The obligation
of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes
only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating
Employers to make such payments. 
Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns
shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific
property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they
be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life
insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which
may be acquired by the Company.  

7.3                  Establishment
of Trust.     The
Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any
fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the
purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as
provided in the Trust.  The Participating
Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable
securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the
terms of the Trust.  If the Participating
Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole
and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds.  

7.4                  Spendthrift
Provision.     Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 7.4, no Participant or Beneficiary
shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any
Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of,
pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the
Participating Employers.  The Plan
Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under
this Plan.  No benefit payable under this
Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following
judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.  

7.4.1               Right
to Designate Beneficiary.     The power to
designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of
such Participant s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power
or right to be exercised by the Participant    so as thereby
to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant s Account or any
part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in
violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be
disregarded by the Participating Employers.  

7.4.2               Plan
Administrator s Right to Exercise Discretion. 
   This Section 7.4 shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from
exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable powers and options granted
to it under any applicable provision hereof.  

27    

7.5                  Compensation
Recovery (Recoupment)    .     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
a Participant who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed directly
or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of the
Company s consolidated financial statements and who becomes subject to the
Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the
Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy )
may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited
and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his
or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company.  

7.5.1              Any Deferral Credit and
related Earnings Credits resulting from the deferral of Eligible Compensation
that is subject to recovery under the Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and,
in such event, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the Participant s
Account balance.  

7.5.2              If a
Participant has commenced distributions and is subject to a claim for recovery
under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company may, subject to any limitations
under Code section 409A, retain all or any portion of the Participant s (or his
or her Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net of state, federal or foreign
tax withholding, to satisfy such claim.  

28    

SECTION 8 
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1                  Adoption.     With the prior approval of
the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become a
Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified copy
of a resolution of its board of directors adopting this Plan.  

8.2                  Amendment.   

8.2.1               General
Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan for future deferrals; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or
reasonable to comply with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective
to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to
any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter
accruing) prior to the date of such amendment. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board authorizes the Committee to amend
this Plan to make changes to the Crediting Rate Alternatives by either adding
any new or deleting any existing Crediting Rate Alternatives, to impose
limitations on selection of or deferral into any Crediting Rate Alternative, or
to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or desirable by
the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan provided such
amendment does not have a material financial impact on the Company.  Such changes will be considered an Amendment
to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the Board.  Written notice of any amendment shall be
given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

8.2.2               Amendment
to Benefit of Executive Officer.     Any amendment
to the benefit of an executive officer under this Plan, to the extent approval
of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.  

8.2.3               No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

8.3                  Termination
and Liquidation.   

8.3.1               General
Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and
liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan,    in
whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

8.3.2               Plan
Termination and Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control, the Plan will
terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and
to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.  

29    

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.8(a), and (ii) a funding of the
Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan
termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective
date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated
as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to
irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its
failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a),  such
termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90
days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been
satisfied.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes
of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated
and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more
than 60 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination
effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have
been satisfied.  

30

claim for the purposes of this Section.  

9.1.1               Initial
Claim.     An individual may, subject
to any applicable deadline, file with the Plan Administrator a written claim

claim.  

(b)                                     The ninety (90)
day period for making the claim determination may be extended for ninety (90)
days if the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an
extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
ninety (90) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

9.1.2               Notice
of Initial Adverse Determination.     A notice of an
adverse determination shall set forth in a manner calculated to be understood

benefits.  Any request for review of the

extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
sixty (60) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

(b)                                     In the event

information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the date
on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the
date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information
or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.  

(c)                                      The Plan
Administrator s review of a denied claim shall take into account all comments,

in conflict or at variance with the provisions hereof may be adopted by the
Plan Administrator.  

32    

9.2.2               Specific
Rules.   

(a)                                      No inquiry or
question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim be filed on
forms to be furnished by the Plan Administrator upon request.  

(b)                                     All decisions
on claims and on requests for a review of denied claims shall be made by the

references in this Section 9 to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as
references to the Plan Administrator s delegate.  

(c)                                      Claimants may
be represented by a lawyer or other representative at their own expense, but
the Plan Administrator reserves the right to require the claimant to furnish
written authorization and establish reasonable procedures for determining
whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant.  A claimant s representative shall be entitled
to copies of all notices given to the claimant.  

(d)                                     The decision of
the Plan Administrator on a claim and on a request for a review of a denied

benefit determination accompanies the filing.

review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards to that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan
documents and, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied
consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.  

(h)                                     The Plan

APPENDIX A   

SPP Benefit   

A-1                 Purpose
and Application.     The purpose of
this Appendix A to this Plan Statement is to establish the rules for
determining the amount of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit under this Plan.  

A-2                 Background.   

A-2.1              Transfer
Credits.                     The Company has
adopted and maintained several nonqualified supplemental pension plans to
provide retirement income to a select group of highly compensated and key
management employees in excess of the retirement income that can be provided
under the Target Pension Plan on account of limitations imposed by the
Code.  Effective April 30, 2002, the
Company began converting the accrued supplemental pension benefits of certain
participants to credits under this Plan as adjusted annually to reflect changes
in such benefits.  

A-2.2              Cash
Balance Formula   .          Effective January 1,
2003, the Target Pension Plan was amended to add a cash balance pension plan
formula (referred to as the  personal pension account ).  Depending on the date participation commences
or an election was made, a Participant who has a benefit under the Target
Pension Plan may have his or her accrued benefit under such plan based solely
on the final average pay formula (the  traditional formula ), solely on the
personal pension account, or a combination of the traditional formula (frozen
as of December 31, 2002) and the personal pension account.  

A-3                 Definitions.   

A-3.1              SPP I              SPP I  means the Target
Corporation SPP I.  

A-3.2              SPP II            SPP II  means the Target
Corporation SPP II.  

A-3.3              SPP III           SPP III  means the Target
Corporation SPP III.  

A-4                 SPP
Benefit.     Each Participant s SPP
Benefit is equal to the sum of the benefits under Section A-4.1, Section A-4.2
and Section A-4.3.  

A-4.1              Traditional
Formula Benefit.     A Participant s
SPP Benefit is the excess, if any, of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over
the monthly pension benefit under (b):  

(a)                                      The monthly
pension benefit the Participant would be entitled to under the Target Pension
Plan, based on the  traditional formula,  if such formula were applied  

(i)                                         without regard
to the maximum benefit limitation required by Code section 415;  

(ii)                                      without regard
to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17);  

39    

(iii)                                   as if the
definition of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a plan
year included compensation that would have been paid in the plan year in the
absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of the compensation to a
later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan;  

(iv)                                  without regard
to the alternative benefit formula of Sections 4.6(a)(3) and 4.6(b)(2) of
the Target Pension  Plan.  

(b)                                     The monthly
pension benefit the Participant is entitled to receive under the Target Pension
Plan on account of the  traditional formula.   

A-4.2              Personal
Pension Account.     A Participant s
SPP Benefit includes the excess, if any, of the amount determined under (a) over
the amount determined under (b):  

(a)                                      The amount that
would have been credited each quarter (including both  pay credits  and  interest
credits ) to the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target
Pension Plan, if such account were applied:  

(i)                                         without regard
to the maximum benefit limitations required by Code section 415;  

(ii)                                      without regard
to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17);  

(iii)                                   as if the definition
of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a calendar quarter
included compensation that would have been paid during such calendar quarter in
the absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of the compensation
to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan;  

(iv)                                  as if a
distribution had been made from such account equal to any SPP Benefit Transfer
Credits made under Section 3.3.  

(b)                                     The amount of
the credits actually made to the Participant s  personal pension account  under
the Target Pension Plan.  

A-4.3              SPP
III.     For a Participant who was
participating in SPP III, the Participant s SPP Benefit includes the actuarial
equivalent lump sum present value of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over
the monthly pension benefit under (b):  

(a)                                      The monthly
pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a) determined by
treating the Participant as five (5) years older than his or her actual
age solely for purposes of determining the early reduction factor (but in no
case shall the Participant s age be deemed to be greater than age 65).  

(b)                                     The monthly
pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a).  

A-4.4              Company
Determination.     The actuarial
lump sum present value of a Participant s benefit determined under this
Appendix A will be determined by the Company, in   

40    

its
sole and absolute discretion, by using such factors and assumptions as the
Company considers appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion as of the
date of distribution or transfer.  

A-5                 Forfeiture
of SPP III Benefit.   

A-5.1              Pre-Age
55 SPP III Forfeiture.               A Participant
who has a Termination of Employment prior to attaining age 55 will forfeit that
portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit
determined under Section A-5.3.  

A-5.2              ICP
Eligibility SPP III Forfeiture.     A Participant
who becomes entitled to receive payments under an income continuation plan or
policy of an Affiliate on account of his or her Termination of Employment after
attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer
Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3.  

A-5.3              Amount
of SPP III Forfeiture.     A Participant s
forfeiture under Sections A-5.1 or A-5.2 is that portion of the SPP Benefit
Transfer Credits attributable to his or her SPP Benefit determined under Section A-4.3
of Appendix A, and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment
adjustment that would have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits
at the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative.

TARGET CORPORATION   

OFFICER INCOME CONTINUANCE
POLICY STATEMENT   

As Amended and Restated January 13,
2010   

I.                                              CONCEPTS   

A.                                        GENERAL   

The present policy of the Corporation is to
provide, under certain defined circumstances, Income Continuance Payments to
certain  Officers  or  Executives  whose employment is terminated at the
instance of the Corporation or who involuntarily or for good reason terminate
within two years after a Change in Control. This policy is intended to assist
in the occupational transition and financial security of those identified
Executives whose services are no longer deemed required within the Corporation,
who have during their tenure been faithful and honest employees, who do not
during the period of those payments engage in disqualifying misconduct, and to
the extent not compensated for services to a directly competitive employer and
to assist Executives who involuntarily or for good reason terminate employment
with the Corporation within two years after a Change in Control.  

This will be known as the Officer Income
Continuance Policy ( Officer-ICP ) of the Corporation. It will be interpreted
and applied in accordance with this Statement of policy and with any subsequent
amendment or restatement applicable to the Executive. The Corporation s Income
Continuance Policy Statement has been consolidated and transferred into the
Officer-ICP.  

The Officer-ICP has been operated in
compliance with Internal Revenue Code ( Code ) Section 409A since January 1,
2005.  Effective January 1, 2009,
the Officer-ICP was amended to comply with Code Section 409A with respect
to all amounts payable from the Officer-ICP that are considered nonqualified
deferred compensation.  

B.                                          ELIGIBILITY   

To be eligible under Officer-ICP, an
individual must be an Officer as specified in this Statement.  

C.                                          REASSIGNMENT   

An Executive will continue to have income
protection under Officer-ICP for at least 12 calendar months (Eligibility
Period) after internal reassignment to a position which does not otherwise include
eligibility for Officer-ICP benefits.  

D.                                         SPIN-OFF   

An Executive who is employed by a business
unit on the closing date of any Spin-Off which includes such business unit is
no longer eligible for Officer-ICP.  

E.                                           DISQUALIFICATION
AND REDUCTION   

Serious and deliberate misconduct in
employment by an Executive resulting in discharge for cause can disqualify an
Executive from Officer-ICP eligibility. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Statement, after termination under Officer-ICP and normal windup of
former duties an Executive will not be required to perform any regular services
for the Corporation, and will be free to accept any other employment. Except as
otherwise provided in this Statement, Officer-ICP Payments otherwise payable to
an Executive will be reduced or excused in the amount of compensation from
Directly Competitive Employment as specifically defined to the Executive in
advance according to this Statement. An Executive otherwise entitled to
Officer-ICP Payments after Termination or Reassignment will be disqualified
from receiving future Payments by reason of serious and deliberate misconduct
which is unlawful or clearly and seriously harmful to the Corporation, or to
its interests.  

F.                                           INTERPRETATION   

Subject to the express terms of this
Statement, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation will have sole and
final authority to interpret the Officer-ICP and determine its application, and
will interpret it consistently. Section I of this Statement is intended as
a summary of the more detailed provisions of Section II. For that reason, Section II
will control in the event of any difference.  

II.                                          APPLICATION   

A.                                        ELIGIBILITY
PERIOD - DEFINITION   

The  Eligibility Period  of an Executive is
determined by the Executive s most recent Salary Grade on the Notice of
Termination or Reassignment by the Corporation; provided, however, in the event
of a downgrade or downgrades, the Eligibility Period of the Executive s highest
Salary Grade shall continue to be applicable until the expiration of the
Eligibility Period for that Salary Grade and then the Eligibility Period for
the next highest Salary Grade shall be used until it expires and this process
shall continue until the Eligibility Period for the last Salary Grade for which
this Statement covers expires. It will be calculated according to the following
schedule:

measured from the time when Officer-ICP Payments first become payable to the
Executive under the terms of this Statement.  

D.                                         PAYMENTS   

1.                                            Amount   

Each monthly Officer-ICP amount during the
Payment Period will equal one twelfth (1/12) of the Executive s Final Annual
Cash Compensation from the Corporation which will consist of the sum of:  

a.                                            Base
Compensation   

The annual Base (regular monthly or other
fixed salary) rate payable as Cash Compensation to the Executive at the time of
Notice of Termination or effective date of Reassignment or downgrade, but in no
event less than the highest annual rate paid to the Executive at any time
during a number of months equal to the Executive s Eligibility Period
immediately before the Notice of Termination or effective date of Reassignment
or downgrade, and  

3    

b.                                           Performance
Bonus   

The average amount of the three annual
Performance Bonuses most recently paid or credited to the Executive as Cash
Compensation or deferred bonus, prior to Executive s Notice of Termination or
effective date of Reassignment or downgrade. For purposes of Officer-ICP, the
Performance Bonus of an Executive shall be determined according to the
applicable Short Term Incentive Plan of the Corporation, shall also include, if
applicable, any discretionary bonus paid during said applicable period on
account of the Executive s performance but outside of the purview of the then
applicable Short Term Incentive Plan.  

c.                                            Adjustment   

The annual rate in dollars of each merit
increase awarded to an Executive before Notice of Termination will be included
in Base Compensation to determine the Executive s Officer-ICP Payments. If the
Executive s annual rate of Base Compensation at the time of Notice of
Termination has been increased or decreased to reflect a change from the Short
Term Incentive Plan used to determine the Performance Bonus defined above, and
the change is for the purpose of altering the future relationship of Bonus to
total Annual Cash Compensation of the Executive, then the dollar amount of that
increase or decrease in annual rate of Base Compensation will be excluded in
determining ICP Payments.  

d.                                           Installment
Payments   

Although the amount of an Executive s benefit
is determined on a monthly basis, such monthly amount shall be converted to and
made at the same frequency as the Corporation s standard payroll practices.
With respect to any benefit under Officer-ICP that is considered deferred
compensation pursuant to Code Section 409A, each installment payment shall
be considered a separate payment.  

2.                                            Commencement   

Officer-ICP Payments, or entitlement to begin
receiving them, will commence after the Corporation has received a valid
unrevoked Release and Agreement from Executive, subject to any Set-offs,
Adjustments and Withholding as specified herein. Unless the Executive is a
Specified Employee, Officer-ICP Payments shall commence not later than ninety
(90) days following the date of the Executive s separation from service, as
defined under Code Section 409A. If at the time of the Executive s
separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A, the Executive
is a Specified Employee then no distribution of an Officer-ICP Payment that is
considered deferred compensation pursuant to Code Section 409A will be
made within 6 months of the separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A,
unless such Officer-ICP Payment would   

4    

otherwise be exempt from the requirements of
Code Section 409A. Any Officer-ICP Payments suspended during such 6 month
period will be paid at the time of the first Officer-ICP Payment after such 6
month period. The Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation, benefits
or perquisites, other than Officer-ICP Payments, after the date of the
Executive s separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A.  

3.                                            Set-Off and
Withholding   

Officer-ICP Payments are not intended to
duplicate or be in addition to any other payment due between the Corporation
and the Executive.  

a.                                            Reduction   

Each Payment otherwise due from the Corporation
to the Executive will be reduced, dollar for dollar and in timing by all
amounts which the Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the
Corporation or under a plan, program or agreement maintained by and at the
expense of the Corporation after the Employment Severance Date. This will
include but not be limited to legally required payments during any required
notice period or in connection with a plant closing, mass layoff, termination,
severance or redundancy under any law, regulation or order. This will also
include such sources as life and disability insurance. It will not apply to
accrued vacation or expense reimbursement (both will be paid in cash at
termination), pension proceeds, 401(k) proceeds, deferred compensation
plans, Social Security, equity awards (for example, stock options, performance
shares or restricted stock awards) or benefits payable under any Worker s
Compensation or similar law or regulation. Termination of employment by reason
of mandatory retirement under a lawful and uniform policy of the employer
applicable to the Executive will not be treated as a termination for
Officer-ICP purposes. In no circumstance whatsoever shall there be any
combination or duplication of any Officer-ICP Payments with any such other
legally required payment or payments which shall result in the Executive
receiving because of or due to termination of employment a combined total
amount from the Corporation which is greater than the amount of Officer-ICP
Payments to which Executive is entitled under this Officer-ICP before
accounting for such legally required other payments.  

b.                                           Adjustments   

Taxes and other amounts which the Corporation
reasonably determines are required by law or by the Executive s written
instruction will be withheld from Officer-ICP amounts otherwise payable.  

5    

E.                                           DEATH OF
EXECUTIVE   

If an Executive should die after Notice of
Termination and before completion of the Executive s Payment Period, the
remaining Payments will be made by the Corporation as follows, without
unnecessary interruption:  

1.                                           Unless the
Executive has otherwise designated in unrevoked writing, acknowledged in
writing by the CEO, the surviving spouse of the Executive, if any, will be
entitled to all remaining Payments.  

2.                                           If the
Executive has otherwise effectively designated in unrevoked writing,
acknowledged in writing by the CEO, then Payment will be made to or for the
account of the person or persons so designated as identified by the
Corporation.  

3.                                           In the absence
of effective prior written designation by the Executive and of a known
surviving spouse, the Corporation shall pay any remaining Payments to the
Executive s estate.  

4.                                           In the interest
of providing uninterrupted income to authorized beneficiaries of the Executive,
any Officer-ICP Payment made with reasonable care and in good faith by the
Corporation shall conclusively constitute Payment by the Corporation in
accordance with and satisfaction of the entitlement of the Executive and
Executive s beneficiaries under Officer-ICP. No interest or other charge shall
be payable by the Corporation or its representatives on any Payment delayed by
the Corporation to permit reasonable verification of authorized recipient(s).  

F.                                           DISQUALIFICATION   

1.                                           No Executive will
be disqualified from receipt of future Officer-ICP Payments by reason of any
act or omission of anyone other than the Executive or one or more persons
acting pursuant to the conscious and effective control of the Executive.
Disqualification will be interpreted as follows:  

a.                                            While Employed in the
Corporation   

Deliberate and serious disloyal or dishonest
conduct in the course of employment will disqualify if it justifies and results
in prompt discharge for specific cause under the established policies and
practices of the Corporation as interpreted by the CEO for this purpose.
Examples would include material unlawful conduct, material and conscious
falsification or unauthorized disclosure of important records or reports,
embezzlement or unauthorized conversion of property, serious violation of
conflict of interest or vendor relations policies, and misuse or disclosure of
significant trade secrets or other information likely to be of use to the
detriment of the Corporation or its interests.  

6    

b.                                           After Notice of Termination   

The Officer-ICP will not restrict an
Executive s conduct or employment opportunities after Notice of Termination, or
any independent remedy of the Corporation or its representatives by reason of
the Executive s conduct while employed. The obligation of the Corporation to or
for an Executive during the Eligibility and Payment Periods can be terminated
only by the deliberate conduct of the Executive or one acting under the
Executive s conscious and effective control, and only as to any Officer-ICP
Payments not yet due, by reason of one or more of the following events:  

1)                  Unauthorized removal, use or
disclosure of strategic or operating plans, trade secrets, customer lists,
internal systems or other significant proprietary information of or concerning
the Corporation or its personnel, the use or disclosure of which is intended or
likely to cause loss or reduction of business advantage or substantial injury
to the Corporation or its management, business opportunities or interests.  

2)                  Expressing or endorsing
publication of untrue statements which are intended or likely to receive broad
public attention and to bring the Corporation or its interests, methods or
representatives into disrepute.  

3)                  Providing materially false
or misleading information concerning post-termination employment, or failure or
refusal promptly and accurately to provide required information, verification
or authorization required by the CEO as provided in this Statement and affecting
any Officer-ICP payment due from the Corporation.  

4)                  Solicitation of or an offer
to an employee within the Corporation to accept employment elsewhere, where the
selection of or offer to the recruited employee was based in the whole or in
part upon Executive s knowledge or experience concerning the employee which was
acquired by the Executive while employed within the Corporation or through one
or more personal acquaintances employed within the Corporation.  

5)                  Exercising the discretion,
authority or powers of an office or position held by an Executive after Notice
of Termination, and whether or not before an Employment Severance Date, unless
specifically authorized or directed in writing in advance by an authorized
executive of the Corporation.  

2.                                            Recoupment   

Notwithstanding
any other provisions of the Officer-ICP, pursuant to the Corporation s
recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of   

7    

the
Board of Directors (the  Committee ) and as amended from time to time ( Recoupment
Policy ), an Officer who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of
the Corporation s consolidated financial statements may be disqualified from
receipt of Officer-ICP Payments and the Committee retains the discretion to
recover Officer-ICP Payments in such event.  

a.                                           If the
Committee determines Officer-ICP Payments are subject to recovery by the
Corporation under this Section II.F.2. and the Recoupment Policy, the
Committee shall be entitled, in its discretion, to demand repayment or
cancellation of all or a portion of the maximum amount that can be recovered or
cancelled, to the extent necessary to avoid unjust enrichment of the recipient
under the circumstances.  

b.                                          Pending a
determination by the Committee on the application of this Section II.F.2.
and the Recoupment Policy to a recipient of Officer-ICP Payments, the Committee
shall have the authority to suspend any payments under the Officer-ICP.  

c.                                           Upon a
determination by the Committee that Officer-ICP payments are subject to
recovery by the Corporation, the Corporation shall have the right, to the
extent permitted by law, to set-off amounts due under this Section II.F.2.
and the Recoupment Policy against any amount owed by the Corporation to the
recipient of Officer-ICP Payments under any deferred compensation plan.  

d.                                          An amendment of
the Recoupment Policy shall not be treated as an amendment of the Officer-ICP
under Section II.M.  

3.                                            Preservation of
Rights   

Neither Officer-ICP nor its application shall
waive, excuse, preclude or otherwise affect any right or remedy which the
Corporation or any agent or representative of the Corporation may have,
individually or collectively, under law by reason of conduct of the Executive
during or after employment within the Corporation. Any remedies or rights set
forth in this Section II.F. will be additional and not exclusive remedies.  

G.                                          COMPETITIVE
EMPLOYMENT   

An Executive will receive not less than the
full amount of the specified Officer-ICP Payments from the Employment Severance
Date through the full Payment Period whether or not compensated by another
employer for services in that period, unless disqualified under Section F.,
immediately above or as provided in this Section G. Compensation from
employment which is not identified as Directly Competitive Employment ( DCE )
will be in addition to and will not reduce any Officer-ICP Payment. If an
Executive engages in DCE as specifically defined in advance and by this
Statement, then each Officer-ICP Payment otherwise payable to the Executive
will be   

8    

currently reduced, dollar for dollar and in
timing, by the amount of all Cash Compensation earned (whether on a current or
deferred payment basis) from that source during the Payment Period.  

These provisions will be interpreted and
administered as follows:  

1.                                            Purpose of
Set-Off   

Reduction of Officer-ICP Payments by the
amount of Cash Compensation determined to be from DCE is not intended to
restrict or penalize an Executive s choice of alternative career opportunities,
but only to preserve and reconcile the personal income security intended to be
provided to Executives by Officer-ICP with the legitimate interests of the
Shareholders of the Corporation in its highly competitive business context.  

2.                                            Competitors
Identified   

At or about the time of Notice of
Termination, the Corporation will inform the Executive in writing of those
employers who have been individually and specifically determined to offer DCE
for Officer-ICP purposes with respect to the Executive s former employment
within the Corporation. This designation will take into account existing
operations and known plans of the Corporation and of the employers listed, and
will not change during the Eligibility Period by reason of subsequent and
mutually unanticipated changes in the operations or plans of either.  

3.                                            Criteria   

The following criteria will be employed in
determining and administering Officer-ICP application to DCE.  

a.                                            Selective
Potential Detriment   

A position will not be determined to
constitute DCE for this purpose unless the CEO determines that the competitive
effectiveness of the Executive and the new employer would be materially
enhanced by the Executive s current knowledge of such matters as the particular
methods, policies, customers, suppliers, personnel or plans of the Corporation
or its relevant business unit, as distinguished from the skills, experience and
services of the Executive generally. The Corporation will identify for DCE
purposes not more than five persons, firms or corporations who are determined
for this purpose to be the leading direct and immediate competitors of the
affected business of the Corporation.  

b.                                           Preservation of
Employment Opportunities   

Whether or not an Executive s most recent
employment within the Corporation involved direct participation in the
management of one or   

9    

more business units, this section will not be
used to discourage or penalize otherwise suitable employment opportunities in
retailing or otherwise. The Corporation may require, as a condition of avoiding
DCE designation for the Executive, a suitable written undertaking by the
Executive and the new employer that the Executive remains obliged not to use or
divulge trade secrets or proprietary information of the Corporation and that
the Executive will not volunteer or be expected or required to violate that
obligation in the course of the new employment.  

c.                                            Relevant
Considerations   

In determining DCE, the CEO will give
suitable consideration to geographic, product and price-line marketing
overlaps, the nature and content of the Executive s particular knowledge of
strategies and plans within the Corporation, and the extent to which the
Executive s knowledge, as distinguished from skills, is likely to be a
significant factor in generating an employment opportunity. Employment
exclusively with a component of a larger business entity, which component is
not presently or known to be planned to be a direct and immediate competitor of
the Executive s former business unit, will not be treated as DCE merely because
one or more other components of that entity is or may become a competitor of
the Corporation or one or more of its business units.  

4.                                            Officer-ICP
Payment Reduction   

Uniform and responsible administration of
Officer-ICP will require reliable information and verification to the
Corporation.  

a.                                            Reporting   

To be eligible for any Officer-ICP Payment
during a period of DCE, an Executive must, in addition to all other required
reporting, provide to the Corporation in writing an accurate statement of the
amount and payment schedule of all Cash Compensation or its equivalent to be
received from the new DCE employer and of any subsequent change or correction
of that amount, in such form and with such verification as the CEO may request
in writing. An Executive will not be or become entitled to receive or retain
any portion of any Officer-ICP Payment on account of any Payment Period for
which that information, and any required verification, is not currently and
accurately provided.  

b.                                           Verification
and Reconciliation   

Required verification may include
authorization for written confirmation from the employer and confidential
disclosure of completed W-2, payroll and income tax forms of the Executive on
which taxes have been or will be paid. If the Corporation withholds for more
than 30 days any Officer-  

10    

ICP
Payment pending receipt of required information or verification which is later
received and found satisfactory, the Corporation will pay interest at a
realistic rate determined by the CEO for the period of delay. The Corporation
and the Executive will each fairly and promptly adjust by payment any
discrepancy later discovered between reported and actual Cash Compensation of
the Executive, but the Corporation will have no liability for any amount not
claimed by an Executive in writing before final expiration of the Executive s
Payment Period.  

H.                 REASSIGNMENT
AND SPIN-OFF   

1.                  Reassignment
and Other Adjustments   

The Corporation may transfer an Executive to
another position within the Corporation or reduce the Executive s Base
Compensation in Executive s current position (collectively referred to as  Reassignment ).
An Executive in the case of either event may elect Officer-ICP Payments if the
Executive s total monetary compensation after Reassignment will be measurably
and substantially below the total monetary compensation of the Executive
immediately before notice of Reassignment. For this purpose, total monetary
compensation will include salary and bonus and continuation, or payment of the
substantial equivalent in Cash Compensation, of all non-cash personal benefits
and perquisites which the Executive was receiving immediately before and does
not receive after the Reassignment and which are susceptible of accurate and
objective measurement in dollars as determined by the CEO. An Executive who
elects Officer-ICP Payments must terminate employment with the Corporation
within thirty (30) days after notice of Reassignment to be eligible for such
payments.  

2.                  Spin-Off   

An Executive who is employed by a business
unit on the closing date of any Spin-Off that includes such business unit is no
longer eligible for Officer-ICP. A Spin-Off will be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this paragraph whether or not afterward: (a) the Executive has
a personal ownership or incentive interest in the severed business unit or
operation; or (b) the severed business unit or operation becomes, as a
result of or after the severance, a part of one or more other legal entity or
entities.  

I.                   REPORTING   

For convenience and uniformity of
administration, each Executive while eligible for or entitled to Officer-ICP
Payments after Notice of Termination will be expected as a pre-condition
currently and accurately to inform the Corporation in writing of the name and
business address of each employer of Executive during the Eligibility and
Payment Periods, including a summary description of the nature and principal
business locations of the new employer and the title, principal duties, address
and telephone number of the Executive. Significant changes in employment,
duties or location will also be promptly reported. The Corporation will not be
required to make any Officer-ICP Payment for   

11    

any period for which it has not received a
current and accurate report as required by, or by the CEO in accordance with,
this Statement.  

J.                  INTERPRETATION   

1.                 Any decision of the CEO will
be: (1) Final and conclusive of the rights and obligations of all affected
parties and (2) Applied uniformly as to all Executives then similarly
situated (subject to subsequent Officer-ICP amendment); and (3) Not
subject to separate determination or review by any public or private agency or
authority except as expressly provided in this Statement.  

2.                 References to compensation
and other monetary rates or measurements in this Statement and its applications
are in current dollars, unadjusted by reason of inflation, deflation or
otherwise.  

3.                 Any portion of a full
calendar month or year will be prorated on a full calendar basis, without
differential related to such considerations as working days or holidays. Any
portion of a day will be treated as a full day, and measurement days will begin
and end at midnight, current time. The fiscal year of the Corporation will be
treated for all purposes as it is for financial reporting purposes.  

4.                 In the event of application
or interpretation of Officer-ICP to an individual Executive who is a Director
of the Corporation, or otherwise in its sole discretion, the Board of Directors
of the Corporation or its authorized committee shall have and may exercise the
sole, exclusive and final authority and discretion of the CEO for any purpose
under Officer-ICP.  

K.                 RELEASE   

Payment and receipt of Officer-ICP Payments
will be in full and final satisfaction of all claims by or through an Executive
against the Corporation and its representatives by reason of the employment of
the Executive and its termination, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Statement or as required by applicable law or regulation. A signed and
unrevoked written Release to that effect, in form approved by the CEO, will be
delivered by the Executive or the Executive s representative to the Corporation
before any Officer-ICP Payment will become payable by the Corporation to or on
account of the Executive. Such Release must be delivered to the Corporation
within 60 days of the date of Executive s separation from service, as defined
under Code Section 409A. The Release may, without limitation, require a
representation that no confidential documents concerning the Corporation or its
intentions have been or will be removed or retained by the Executive without
specific authority, and that the Executive will not engage in disqualifying
misconduct as defined in this Statement, in reference to the Corporation. The
Release will not affect any conversion, vested or continuing rights available
to an Executive under a plan of the Corporation other than Officer-ICP.  

12    

L.                  GENERAL   

The Officer-ICP and this Statement will not
constitute or infer an obligation or undertaking to employ any person for any
future period of time or in any specific position. Officer-ICP Eligibility or
Payments after Notice of Termination will not create, continue or evidence any
employment relationship with the Corporation. All employment privileges,
benefits and perquisites not expressly and in writing reserved to an Executive
under Officer-ICP will terminate on Executive s separation from service, as
defined under Code Section 409A, unless otherwise expressly agreed in
advance in writing by the Corporation. This will not affect any conversion,
vested or other continuing benefits or rights available to an Executive under a
plan of the Corporation other than Officer-ICP.  

M.                AMENDMENT   

Officer-ICP and this Statement may not be
terminated and may not be amended to reduce benefits with respect an Executive
subject to the Officer-ICP until twelve months after the Executive receives
written notice of the proposed termination or amendment. Except as set forth in
the first sentence hereof, Officer-ICP and this Statement can be amended
(including modification, restatement, suspension and termination) at any time,
without prior written notice to or consultation with any Executive, by the
Board of Directors or any committee appointed by the Board of Directors having
the authority of the Board for that purpose. Any such change will have effect
as follows:  

1.                  Effective Date
of Change   

Except as set forth below, any amendment will
be effective on the date of its adoption by the Board or committee or such
other such subsequent date or dates as may be specified in the amendment or the
resolution by which it is adopted. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing
by the parties, (a) an amendment or termination will have no effect upon
any Executive who at the time has received Notice of Termination under
Officer-ICP and (b) a termination or an amendment that reduces benefits
will not be effective as to an Executive subject to the Officer-ICP until
twelve months after the Executive receives written notice of the termination or
amendment.  

2.                  Notice of
Amendment   

The Corporation will promptly after any
amendment provide to each Executive then eligible for Officer-ICP benefits a
written statement of Officer-ICP as amended, and no amendment will be effective
as to an Executive until the later of the date the Executive receives such
written statement, or twelve months after notice as provided in 1 above. An
Executive will be deemed to have received the written statement if it is delivered
to the Executive in person, or after 48 hours following its hand delivery or
dispatch by mail or other suitable means of delivery to the last known address
of the Executive.  

13    

3.                  Acquiescence   

An amendment will apply in full to an
Executive if mutually agreed in writing by the Executive and the Corporation,
or if the Executive or the Executive s representative knowingly receives a
benefit or improvement under Officer-ICP as amended which would not have been
available without the amendment. If any such benefit from an amendment is
knowingly received by an Executive with the consent of the Corporation, then
all elements of that amendment and all prior Officer-ICP Statements and
amendments then currently in effect will also be applicable to the Executive.  

4.                  Adjustment   

A change in or addition or deletion of any
benefit or perquisite plan or program of the Corporation applicable to an
Executive may be expressly made subject to prior written agreement by the
Executive upon a corresponding change in the interpretation or application of
Officer-ICP to the Executive, to prevent redundant or other unintended benefits
or detriments to the Executive or the Corporation which might otherwise result.  

5.                  Change in Control   

No amendment or termination that would
adversely affect the benefits or protections under the Officer-ICP of any
eligible Executive as of the date of such amendment or termination shall be
effective as to such individual unless no Change in Control occurs within
twelve (12) months of the adoption of such amendment or termination, and any
such attempted amendment or termination adopted within twelve (12) months prior
to a Change in Control shall retroactively be null and void from the date of
adoption as it relates to all such Executives who were eligible for benefits
under the Officer-ICP prior to such adoption.  

For two (2) years after a Change in
Control, the Officer-ICP and this Statement may not be amended in any manner
that would adversely affect the benefits or protections under the Officer-ICP
of the Executives who are eligible for benefits under the Officer-ICP at the
time of the Change in Control.  

N.                 APPLICABLE LAW   

It is intended that the decision of the CEO,
as specified in the Officer-ICP statement, will be exclusive and final with
respect to any application or interpretation of Officer-ICP. If any body of law
should be used or applied in determining the meaning or effect of Officer-ICP,
in the interest of consistency this will be deemed an agreement made and
executed in the State of Minnesota and the law of the State of Minnesota will
control to the extent not preempted by federal law.

Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of

that, as a result of such transaction, owns Target or all or substantially all

Specified Employee  means an Executive who
as of the date of his or her separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A,
is a  key employee  (as defined below), and the Corporation has stock that is

The Executive is a  key employee  during the 12-month period beginning on the April 1
immediately following a calendar year, any time during which such Executive was
a key employee as defined in Code Section 416(i) (without regard to
Code Section 416(i)(5)), of the Corporation. An Executive will not be
treated as a Specified Employee if he or she would not be a  specified employee 
as defined under Treasury regulations issued under Code Section 409A.  

NOTE:            Additional Definitions for
particular purposes are contained in the text.  

P.                  CHANGE IN
CONTROL   

Other provisions of this Statement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in the event of a Change in Control:  

1.                 If an Executive s employment
with the Corporation is terminated, whether involuntarily or by the Executive
for  good reason  (as defined in Section II.P.5), within two years
following a Change in Control, an Executive shall be eligible for Officer-ICP
Payments.  

2.                 To the extent the Officer
ICP-Payments are not subject to Code Section 409A (including pursuant to a
short-term deferral exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and
separation pay plan exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)),
or such Change in Control qualifies as a  change in control event  under Code Section 409A,
the Officer-ICP Payments shall be made in a lump sum payment within 20 days of
the Executive s separation of service, as defined under Code Section 409A;
provided that if the Executive is a Specified Employee, the distribution of any
such Officer-ICP Payments subject to Code Section 409A will be made 6
months after the separation of service, as defined under Code Section 409A.  The lump sum amount shall be determined by
discounting the periodic Officer-  

18    

ICP Payments by a rate equivalent to the
annual prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the first business
day following the Officer-ICP Payments.  

3.                 To the extent the
Officer-ICP Payments are subject to Code Section 409A, (after considering
any exceptions to Code Section 409A, including the short-term deferral
exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and
separation pay plan exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9))  and such Change in Control does not qualify
as a change in control event under Code Section 409A, the Officer-ICP
Payments shall be made according to the payment schedule set forth in Section II.D
of this Statement; provided that if the Executive is a Specified Employee, the
distribution of any such Officer-ICP Payments subject to Code Section 409A
will be made 6 months after Executive s separation from service, as defined
under Code Section 409A.  

4.                 Except for the Release
required by Section II.K of this Statement, all other obligations or
restrictions of Executive under this Statement shall terminate.  

5.                 For purposes of this Section II.P,
 good reason  shall mean any material diminution of the Executive s position,
authority, duties or responsibilities (including the assignment of duties
materially inconsistent with the Executive s position or a material increase in
the time Executive is required by the Corporation or its successor to travel),
any reduction in salary or in the Executive s aggregate bonus and incentive
opportunities, any material reduction in the aggregate value of the Executive s
employee benefits (including retirement, welfare and fringe benefits), or
relocation to a principal work site that is more than 40 miles from the
Executive s principal work site immediately prior to the Change in Control.  

6.                 If an Executive s employment
was terminated prior to a Change in Control, such Executive is receiving or is
entitled to receive Officer-ICP Payments that will continue after the Change in
Control, and the Change in Control qualified as a  change in control event  for
purposes of Code Section 409A, then, subject to the six month delay for
Specified Employees in effect under Section II.D.2, the Officer-ICP
Payments due after such change in control event will be accelerated and paid to
Executive in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but not more than 90 days
following such change in control event. The lump sum under this Section II.P.6
will be calculated in the same manner as the lump sum calculated under Section II.P.2
above.  

Q.                 CERTAIN
REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS BY THE CORPORATION   

1.                 Anything in this Officer-ICP
to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section Q shall
apply to an Executive if the Auditor determines that each of a and b below are
applicable.  

19    

a.                 Payments hereunder,
determined without application of this Section Q, either alone or together
with other payments in the nature of compensation to the Executive which are
contingent on or accelerated by a change in the ownership or effective control
of the Corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets
of the Corporation, or otherwise, would result in any portion of the payments
hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed
under Code Section 4999.  

b.                 The excise tax imposed on
the Executive under Section 4999 of the Code on excess parachute payments,
from whatever source, would result in a lesser net aggregate present value of
payments and distributions to the Executive (after subtraction of the excise
tax) than if payments and distributions to the Executive were reduced to the
maximum amount that could be made without incurring the excise tax.  

2.                 Under this Section Q
the payments under this Officer-ICP shall be reduced (but not below zero) so
that the present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the
Reduced Amount. The  Reduced Amount  (which may be zero) shall be an amount
expressed as the present value of the payments and distributions under this
Officer-ICP that can be made without causing such payments and distributions to
be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. To the extent
necessary, the reductions in the payments and distributions will be applied to
those Officer-ICP payments nearest the Employment Severance Date until the full
amount of the necessary reductions have been applied. The determinations and
reductions under this Section Q shall be made before any eliminations or
reductions, if any, have been made under the Corporation s Long Term Incentive
Plan.  

3.                 If the Auditor determines
that this Section Q is applicable to an Executive, it shall so advise the
Corporation. The Corporation shall then promptly give the Executive notice to
that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such
determination which shall include a statement of the Reduced Amount. Such
notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the payments
shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the aggregate
present value of the payments equals the Reduced Amount.) For purposes of this Section Q,
present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G of the
Code. All the foregoing determinations made by the Auditor under this Section Q
shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that parachute
payments will be made to the Executive if an elimination or reduction is not
made. As promptly as practicable following the election hereunder, the
Corporation shall pay to or for the benefit of the Executive such amounts as
are then due to the Executive under this Officer-ICP and shall promptly pay to
or for the benefit of the Executive in the future such amounts as become due to
the Executive under this Officer-ICP.  

4.                 As a result of the uncertainty
in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Auditor hereunder, it is possible that   

20    

payments under this Officer-ICP will have
been made which should not have been made ( Overpayment ) or that additional
payments which will have not been made could have been made ( Underpayment ),
in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.
In the event that the Auditor, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the
Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the
Auditor believes has a high probability of success, determines that an
Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes
as a loan to the Executive which the Executive shall repay together with
interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of
the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Executive
if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject
to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the
Auditor, based upon controlling precedent, determines that an Underpayment has
occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of
the Executive together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided
for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.  

5.                 In making its determination
under this Section Q, the value of any non-cash benefit shall be determined
by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) of
the Code.  

6.                 All determinations made by
the Auditor under this Section Q shall be binding upon the Corporation and
the Executive.

CLAIMS PROCEDURE    

   for the   

   Target
Corporation   

   Officer
Income Continuance Policy Statement   

When your employment with Target Corporation (the  Company )
terminates, the Company will tell you whether you are eligible for benefits
from the above-referenced plan and, if so, the amount and timing of the
payments that will be made to you.  

If you believe that the Company s determination is incorrect in any
way, you must file a written claim with the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. The Chief Executive Officer or his or her delegate ordinarily will
respond to the claim within 90 days of the date on which it is received.
However, if special circumstances require an extension of the period of time
for processing a claim, the 90-day period can be extended for an additional 90
days by giving you written notice of the extension and the reason that the
extension is necessary.  

If the claim for a benefit is approved, you will receive written notice
of the amount of your benefit and the date on which payments will begin. If
your claim is denied in whole or in part, you will be told in writing the
specific reasons for the decision and will receive an explanation of the
procedures for reviewing the decision.  

If you do not agree with the decision, you can request that the Chief
Executive Officer reconsider his or her decision by filing a written request
for review within 60 days after receiving notice that the claim has been
denied. You or your representative can also present written statements which
explain why you believe that the benefit claimed should be paid and may review
all pertinent plan documents.  

Generally, the decision will be reviewed within 60 days after the Chief
Executive Officer receives a request for reconsideration. However, if special
circumstances require a delay, the review may take up to 120 days. (If a
decision cannot be made within the 60-day period, you will be notified of this
fact in writing.) You will receive a written notice of the decision which will
explain the reasons for the decision by making specific reference to the Plan
provisions on which the decision is based.  

These Claims Procedures must be followed before you can file a lawsuit
seeking recovery of any Officer-ICP Payments to which you claim to be entitled.

financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;      4.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange

  a.    designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared;      b.    designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting

significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b.    any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15(d)-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
 
  a.    designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared;      b.    designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles;      c.    evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of
the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and      d.    disclosed
in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal
quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting; and     
   5.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):  
 
  a.    all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b.    any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
