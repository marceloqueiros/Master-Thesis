Part I 

ITEMS 1 AND 2 BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES  
  In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC) incorporated in 1986, or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates. Occidental s executive offices are located at 5 Greenway Plaza, Suite 110, Houston, Texas 77046; telephone (713) 215-7000. 

GENERAL 
  Occidental s principal businesses consist of three segments. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.     Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  
  For information regarding Occidental's segments, geographic areas of operation and current developments, including strategies and actions related thereto, see the information in the "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD A) section of this report and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS 
  General 
  Occidental s domestic upstream oil and gas operations are located in New Mexico and Texas. International operations are located in Bolivia, Colombia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
    
  Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes 
  The table below shows Occidental s total oil, NGLs and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  . See "MD A   Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.  
    
  Competition  
  As a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and local, current and anticipated market conditions. Occidental competes for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of its products. They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants. Occidental s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional fields, utilizing primary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and strategic acquisitions in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage as a result of its current successful operations or investments in shared infrastructure. Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services. 

Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes 
  Oil, which includes condensate, and NGLs are in millions of barrels; natural gas is in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are in millions.  

Note  :   The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided under the heading "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information". Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties. 
           (a) 
    Excludes proved reserves and sales volumes for Occidental's California oil and gas operations, which were transferred to California Resources Corporation (California Resources) in November 2014, and has been treated as discontinued operations. 
              (b) 
    Natural gas volumes are converted to BOE at six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas per one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in   2016  , the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were   $43.32   per barrel and   $2.42   per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS 
  General 
  OxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 23 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility. The cracker remains on budget and on schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017. OxyChem has announced a $145 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The project will produce an OxyChem patented new raw material used in making next-generation, climate-friendly refrigerants with a low global warming and  

ozone depletion potential. Construction work has begun with an anticipated completion date in late 2017.  
    
  Competition 
  OxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers. OxyChem s market position was first or second in the United States in 2016 for the principal basic chemical s products it manufactures and markets as well as for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM). OxyChem ranks in the top three producers of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) in the United States. OxyChem s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price. 

OxyChem produces the following products:

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONS 
  General 
  Occidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties.  
    
  Competition 
  Occidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets. Occidental's domestic pipeline business competes with other midstream transportation companies to provide transportation services. The competitive strategy of  

Occidental's domestic pipeline business is to ensure that its pipeline and gathering systems connect various production areas to multiple market locations. Transportation rates are regulated and tariff-based. Other midstream and marketing operations also support Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas and chemical operations. Occidental's marketing business competes with other market participants on exchange platforms and through other bilateral transactions with direct counterparties. Occidental maximizes the value of its transportation and storage assets by marketing its own and third-party production in the oil and gas business.  

The midstream and marketing operations are conducted in the locations described below:                       Location

ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORS 
  Volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect Occidental s results of operations. 
  Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products, particularly oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, and its chemical products.  
  Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely. Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.  
  Prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in Occidental's control. These factors include, among others:  

Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. 

The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. 
                
    Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas.  
                
    Changes in weather patterns and climatic changes. 
                
    The impacts of the members of OPEC and other producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels. 
                
    The worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere. 
                
    The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels. 
                
    Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes. 
                
    Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments. 
                
    General economic conditions worldwide. 
       
  The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products are uncertain. Generally, Occidental's practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products in the future.  
  Global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly since 2014. These conditions may continue for an extended period. Declines in commodity prices could require Occidental to reduce capital spending  and impair the carrying value of assets.  
  The prices obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States and global economies, as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations. 
    
  Occidental may experience delays, cost overruns, losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities. 
  Occidental bears the risks of equipment failures, construction delays, escalating costs or competition for services, materials, supplies or labor, property or border disputes, disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production, replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns. 
  Exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays, misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data, unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity, which may result in significant losses. 

6 

Governmental actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations. 
  Occidental s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local and foreign governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces risks of: 
             
    New or amended laws and regulations, or interpretations of such laws and regulations, including those related to drilling, manufacturing or production processes (including well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization), labor and employment, taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, entitlements, import, export and use of raw materials, equipment or products, use or increased use of land, water and other natural resources, safety, security and environmental protection, all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of Occidental or its contractors, increase Occidental's costs or reduce demand for Occidental's products. 
                
    Refusal of, or delay in, the extension or grant of exploration, development or production contracts. 
                
    Development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for, or denial of, drilling and other permits and authorizations.  
     In addition, Occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions. Exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources. 
    
  Occidental's oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves. 
  Results of operations, reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend, in part, on Occidental s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves. Occidental has many competitors (including national oil companies), some of which: (i) are larger and better funded, (ii) may be willing to accept greater risks or (iii) have special competencies. Competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts. In addition, during periods of low product prices, any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts. 
  Occidental s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may: (i) not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less-than-expected reserves or production or changed circumstances, such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices; (ii) bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties; (iii) experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; or (iv) assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated. 

Occidental s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision. 
  Reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability, including production decline rates, operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices, assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures, as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. If Occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions, its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, the discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with SEC regulations. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.  
    
  Concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect Occidental s operations or results. 
  Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, natural gas and other products that Occidental s businesses produce. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas and other products produced by Occidental s businesses. Consequently, government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental s business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  It is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required, the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered, and Occidental s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company s oil, natural gas and other products. 

7 

Occidental s businesses may experience catastrophic events. 
  The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, well blowouts, fires, explosions, chemical releases, crude oil releases, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates. Third-party insurance may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses. 
    
  Cyber-attacks could significantly affect Occidental. 
  Cyber-attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. Occidental relies on digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing and pipeline operations.  Use of the internet, cloud services and other public networks exposes Occidental s business to cyber-attacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, release confidential information, corrupt data and disrupt critical systems and operations.  Even though Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber-attack, there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. While we have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses.  However, if in the future our cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient, the potential consequences to Occidental s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant.  As cyber-attacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication, we may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance our cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and network security vulnerabilities. 
    
  Occidental's oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business. 
   Unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both, proved reserves will generally decline. Management expects improved recovery, extensions and discoveries to continue       as main sources for reserve additions but factors, such as geology, government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans, are partially or fully outside management's control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations.  
    
  Other risk factors.

  TRADING PRICE RANGE AND DIVIDENDS  
  This section incorporates by reference the quarterly financial data appearing under the caption "Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the information appearing under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in the MD A section of this report. Occidental s common stock was held by approximately 26,000 stockholders of record at   January 31, 2017  , and by approximately 700,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts. The common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The quarterly financial data set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.  
  Dividends declared on the common stock were $0.75 for the first and second quarter of   2016   and $0.76 for the third and fourth quarter ($3.02 for the year). On February 16,   2017  , a quarterly dividend of $0.76 per share was declared on the common stock, payable on April 14,   2017  , to stockholders of record on March 10,   2017  . The current annual dividend rate of $3.04 per share has increased by over 500 percent since 2002. The declaration of future dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

ITEM 7  
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A) 
    In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and  

vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  

12 

STRATEGY 
  General  
  Through its operations, Occidental aims to maximize Total Shareholder Return through a combination of: 
             
    Consistent dividend growth;  
                
    Value growth through oil and gas development that meets above cost-of-capital returns (ROE and ROCE) and return targets of greater than 15 percent and 20 percent for domestic and international projects, respectively;  
                
    Target growth rates of 5 percent to 8 percent average per year over the long-term; and 
                
    Maintain a strong balance sheet. 
     In conducting its business, Occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks. Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.  
  Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business. In 2016, Occidental continued to experience a challenging price environment with low oil, natural gas and NGLs prices. In order to manage this risk, Occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and may access capital markets, as necessary.  
  In connection with Occidental's strategic review initiatives, Occidental: 
             
    Acquired producing and non-producing leasehold acreage, CO   2    properties and related infrastructure in the Permian Basin, which leverages existing infrastructure and operational synergies; and 
                
    Completed its exit of non-core operations in the Piceance Basin, Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. 
       
  The following describes the application of Occidental s overall strategy for each of its operating segments: 
    
  Oil and Gas 
  The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy primarily by: 
             
    Operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and to increase production from core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, Colombia, Oman, Qatar and UAE; 
                
    Focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies, improvement in new well productivity and better base management to reduce total spend per barrel;  
                
    Using enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as CO   2   , water and steam floods, in mature fields; 
                
    Focusing many of Occidental's subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin. This focus is in support of a sizable capital program within these developments; and 
                
    Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach with capital expenditures to focus on returns and maintain  

discipline, with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental's existing positions.  
  In 2016, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $2.0 billion, and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the Permian Basin and the Middle East. This activity reflects Occidental's strategy to focus on achieving returns above the cost of capital even in a low price environment.  
  Management believes Occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the Permian Basin and Colombia and focused international projects in the Middle East.  
    
  Chemical 
  The primary objective of OxyChem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. The chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC). OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility. The joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that U.S. shale gas development has presented to U.S. chemical producers by providing low-cost ethane as a raw material. The joint venture will provide OxyChem with an ongoing source of ethylene, significantly reducing OxyChem's reliance on third-party ethylene suppliers. The construction of the ethylene cracker remains on budget and on schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017. In 2016, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $324 million. Additionally, $160 million was spent on the Mexichem joint venture. In the first quarter of 2016, OxyChem sold its Occidental Tower building in Dallas for a pre-tax gain of approximately $57 million and a non-core specialty chemicals  business for a pre-tax gain of approximately $31 million. In 2016, OxyChem announced a $145 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The project will produce an OxyChem patented new raw material used in making next-generation, climate-friendly refrigerants with a low global warming and ozone depletion potential. Construction work has begun with an anticipated completion date in late 2017. 

13 

Midstream and Marketing  
  The midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets. In order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other Occidental segments as well as third parties. The segment invests in and operates pipeline systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities, and storage facilities. The segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental's businesses, while limiting credit risk exposure. Capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of Occidental's assets. In 2016, capital expenditures totaled $358 million related to Permian Basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure,  Al Hosn Gas and the Ingleside Crude Terminal. 
    
  Key Performance Indicators 
  Occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return. In addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics: 
             
    Health, environmental, safety and process metrics; 
                
    Total Shareholder Return, including funding the dividend; 
                
    Return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE); and 
                
    Specific measures such as total spend per barrel, per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development costs and reserves replacement percentages. 

OIL AND GAS SEGMENT 
  Business Environment 
  Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s financial performance. The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for   2016   and   2015  : 

The following table presents Occidental's average realized prices as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for   2016   and   2015  :  

Average WTI and Brent oil price indexes declined 11 percent and 16 percent, from $48.80 and $53.64 in   2015   to $43.32 and $45.04 in   2016  , respectively. Average worldwide realized oil prices fell $8.37, or 18 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015. However, the WTI and Brent oil price indexes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of   2016  , closing at $53.72 per barrel and $56.82 per barrel, respectively, as of   December 31, 2016  , well above the 2016 average prices. The average realized domestic natural gas price in   2016   decreased 12 percent from   2015  . Average NYMEX natural gas prices declined 12 percent, from $2.75 in   2015   to $2.42 in   2016  .  
  Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty. 
  The decline in oil and gas prices during 2016 and 2015, as well as the decision to sell or exit non-core assets, caused Occidental to assess the carrying value of all of its oil and gas producing assets and assess development plans for its non-producing assets. In 2016, impairment and related charges were immaterial. In 2015, Occidental recorded total pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion for its domestic assets and $5.0 billion for its international assets. To assess carrying value of its oil and gas assets, Occidental uses oil and gas price curves settled on the last trading day of each quarter. While oil and gas future prices were increasing at the end of 2016 any future sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future. 
    
  Operations 
  2016 Developments 
  In March 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for approximately $153 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $121 million. 
  In September 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its South Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties for $63 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $59 million.  
  In October 2016, Occidental acquired producing and non-producing leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin. This acquisition includes 35,000 net acres in Reeves and Pecos counties, Texas, in the Southern Delaware Basin, in areas where Occidental currently operates or has working interests. Separately, Occidental also acquired working interests in several producing oil and gas properties with CO   2    floods and related EOR infrastructure, increasing Occidental's ownership in several properties where it is currently the operator or an existing working interest partner. The total purchase price for these  

14 

transactions was approximately $2.0 billion.  
  In 2016, Occidental completed its exit of non-core operations in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.   
    
  Business Review 
  Domestic Interests 
  Occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns. Occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. Of the total 3.6 million net acres in which Occidental has interests, approximately 84 percent is leased, 15 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.

Permian Basin  
  Occidental's Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. The basin extends throughout west Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total United States oil production. Occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the Permian Basin with an approximate 12 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and NGLs in the basin. 
  Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities and Permian EOR, which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as CO   2    floods and waterfloods. During   2016  , the Permian operations focused on full cycle value through capital efficiency, reduced operating expense, improved base production and new well productivity. In the Permian Basin, Occidental spent over $1.2 billion of capital in   2016  , with 60 percent spent on Permian Resources assets. In   2017  , Occidental expects to allocate approximately one third of the 2017 capital budget to Permian Resources for focused development areas in the Midland and Delaware Basins and approximately 10 to 15  percent to Permian EOR in order to add to existing facilities to increase CO   2    production and injection capacity for future projects. 
  Occidental's Permian Resources operations are among its fastest growing assets with over 11,650 drilling locations in its horizontal inventory located in the Midland and Delaware sub-basins. This inventory was developed using data gathered from appraisal efforts, and development drilling, along with offset operators drilling activities. As of year end, approximately 650 of these drilling locations represented proved reserves. Continued wellbore placement and completion optimization through advanced subsurface characterization and the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, combined with projected commercial savings, are expected to increase the well inventory even further. The development program, which largely began in 2010, continued in   2016  . In 2016, Permian Resources drilled 63 horizontal wells. Production from Permian Resources comes from approximately 5,550 net wells, of which 23 percent are operated by other operators. These investments in Permian wells operated by others allows Occidental to access and leverage additional data in the same areas where it is operating. By analyzing the operated by others data with the significant amount of data Occidental has gathered, its Permian operations are able to use the information to aid in reducing operating expenses, gain drilling and completions efficiencies, increase the productivity of its wells and improve the base production. In 2016, Permian Resources added 92 million BOE to Occidental's proved reserves.  
  Permian EOR operates a combination of CO   2    floods and waterfloods, which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements. Due to a unique combination of characteristics, the Permian Basin has been a leader in the  

15 

implementation of CO   2    enhanced oil recovery projects. The Permian Basin s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO   2    flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO   2    supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production. With 31 active floods and over 40 years of experience, Permian EOR is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO   2    flooding. 
  Occidental is an industry leader in applying this technology, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent in the fields where it is employed. Significant opportunity remains to expand Occidental's existing projects into new portions of reservoirs that thus far have only been water-flooded, leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new CO   2    injection. Even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves. Technology improvements, such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the CO   2    flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects. Over the last few years, Occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells, with 125 wells deepened in   2016   and 100 wells planned for   2017  . Occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional CO   2    floodable sections of the reservoir. These are low cost projects that can add reserves even in a low price environment. Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO   2    projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. In 2016, Permian EOR had its largest improved recovery additions in more than 10 years adding 72 million BOE to Occidental's proved reserves, primarily as a result of executing CO   2    flood development projects and expansions as well as extending the approved CO   2    slug size of current floods.  
  The current strategy for Permian EOR is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production and provide cash flow. By exploiting natural synergies between Permian EOR and Permian Resources, Occidental is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations. Occidental's share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 269,000 BOE per day in 2016 with 124,000 BOE per day coming from Permian Resources and 145,000 BOE per day from Permian EOR. 
    
  South Texas and Other 
  Occidental holds approximately 178,000 net acres in South Texas. Occidental's share of production in South Texas and Other was approximately 33,000 BOE per day. 
    
  International Interests 
  Production-Sharing Contracts  
  Occidental's interests in Oman and Qatar are subject to production sharing contracts (PSC). Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases  

when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.

  Oman 
  In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 with a 50-percent working interest, Block 27 with a 65-percent working interest, Block 53 with a 45-percent working interest; and Block 62, with an 80-percent working interest. 
  In December 2015, the existing production sharing contract for Block 9 expired and Occidental agreed to operate Block 9 under modified operating terms until a new contract is approved. The Block 9 Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement 15-year extension was signed in January 2017 and will be effective upon ratification through Royal Decree. In 2016, the average gross production from Block 9 was 94,000 BOE per day. The term for Block 27 expires in 2035. 
  A 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna Field (Block 53) was signed with the Government of Oman in 2005, pursuant to  

16 

which Occidental assumed operation of the field. By the end of 2016, Occidental had drilled more than 2,900 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project. In 2016, the average gross daily production was 127,000 BOE per day, including a record fourth quarter production of 133,000 BOE per day, which was approximately 16 times higher than the production rate in September 2005 when Occidental assumed operations.  
  In 2008, Occidental was awarded a 20-year contract for Block 62, subject to declaration of commerciality, where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting natural gas and condensate resources. In 2014, Occidental signed a five-year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area (natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir) for Block 62. Production commenced in January 2016. 
  In 2016, Occidental achieved record production in Oman, and Occidental's share of production averaged 96,000 BOE per day in 2016.  
    
  Qatar 
  In Qatar, Occidental is the operator of the offshore fields Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and Al Rayyan (Block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest. The terms for ISND and ISSD expire in 2019 and 2022, respectively. The term for Block 12 expires on May 31, 2017 and this contract will not be extended. Production from Block 12 was not significant.  
  Occidental has continued to successfully implement large scale water flooding projects combined with state of the art horizontal drilling, advanced completion techniques as well as utilizing extensive automated artificial lift systems that are significantly extending the life of the field. Since the commencement of its operations in 1994, Occidental has boosted the production from the Idd El Shargi fields by over 400 percent with current gross oil rates of around 95,000 BOE per day.  The ISSD field recently demonstrated encouraging results and is achieving record levels of production. Despite complex marine operations, Occidental is recognized as the lowest cost in country oil operator.  
  Occidental also holds the Dolphin investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns: (i) a 24.5-percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under a Development and Production Sharing Agreement with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural gas, NGLs and condensate in Qatar s North Field through mid-2032, with a provision to request a five-year extension; and (ii) a 24.5-percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy), which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in "Midstream and Marketing Segment - Pipeline Transportation." 
  Occidental's share of production from Qatar was approximately 108,000 BOE per day in   2016  . 
    
  United Arab Emirates 
  In 2011, Occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in Al Hosn Gas, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement. In 2016, Al Hosn Gas gross production  

exceeded expectations, producing over 570 MMcf per day of natural gas and 95,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate in its highest month of production. Occidental s share of production from Al Hosn Gas was 190 MMcf per day of natural gas and 32,000 barrels per day of NGLs and condensate in 2016.  
  Additionally, Al Hosn Gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in "Midstream and Marketing Segment - Gas Processing Plants and CO   2    Fields and Facilities". 
  Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental s Middle East oil and gas operations.

Colombia 
  Occidental has working interests in the La Cira-Infantas and Teca areas and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin. Occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas. In 2016, Occidental started a thermal recovery pilot at the Teca heavy oil field and the initial results are better than anticipated. Production began from these pilots in 2016. Occidental's share of production from Colombia was approximately 33,000 BOE per day in   2016  . 
  Occidental also holds working interests in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia, which produce gas. Occidental's share of production from Bolivia was 1,000 BOE per day in   2016  . 
    
  Proved Reserves 
  Proved oil, NGLs and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. For the   2016  ,   2015     and     2014   disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices  

17 

were $42.75, $50.28 and $94.99 per barrel, respectively. The calculated average Brent oil prices for   2016  ,   2015     and     2014   disclosures were $44.49, $55.57 and $99.51, per barrel, respectively. The calculated average Henry Hub gas prices for   2016  ,   2015     and     2014   were $2.55, $2.66 and $4.42 per MMBtu, respectively. 
  Occidental had proved reserves at year-end   2016   of 2,406 million BOE, compared to the year-end   2015   amount of 2,200 million BOE. Proved reserves at year-end   2016   and   2015   consisted of, respectively, 56 percent and 59 percent oil, 17 percent and 15 percent NGLs and 27 percent and 26 percent natural gas. Proved developed reserves represented approximately 77 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end   2016   and   2015  .  
  Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. For further information regarding Occidental's proved reserves, see "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" following the "Financial Statements." 
    
  Changes in Proved Reserves 
  Occidental's total proved reserves increased 206 million BOE in   2016  , which included additions of 187 million BOE from Occidental's development program.  
  Changes in reserves were as follows: 

Occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management s control, and may negatively or positively affect Occidental's reserves.  
    
  Revisions of Previous Estimates 
  Revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental's share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs. Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental's share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations. In 2016, positive revisions of 159 million BOE were primarily due to technical revisions in Al Hosn Gas and price  

revisions in Oman due to the PSC impact, partially offset by negative domestic price revisions.  
  Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.  
    
  Improved Recovery 
  In   2016  , Occidental added proved reserves of 185 million BOE mainly associated with the Permian Basin and Oman operations. These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO   2    flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects. These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. The use of either CO   2    or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO   2    or steam and other economic factors. Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. Many of Occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells. In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells. 
    
  Extensions and Discoveries 
  Occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. In   2016  , extensions and discoveries added 2 million BOE related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in Oman. 
    
  Purchases of Proved Reserves 
  Occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable. As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.  
  In 2016, Occidental purchased 137 million BOE of proved reserves in the Permian Basin, which mainly came from acquisitions made in October 2016.  
    
  Sales of Proved Reserves 
  In 2016, Occidental sold 46 million BOE in proved reserves mainly related to Libya and Piceance.  
    
  Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
  In   2016  , Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 195 million BOE mainly from Permian Basin improved recovery and purchases. These proved undeveloped reserve additions were partially offset by transfers of 66 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of the   2016   development programs  

18 

and 47 million BOE of negative price and price related revisions. Permian Basin and Oman accounted for approximately 89 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in   2016  . Occidental incurred approximately $0.5 billion in   2016   to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. A substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of   December 31, 2016  , was the result of the development program in the Permian Basin, which represents 75 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.  
    
  Reserves Evaluation and Review Process 
  Occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of   December 31, 2016  , were made by Occidental s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves. This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance. These field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities. 
  Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
  The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental's oil and gas reserves data. The Senior Vice President has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified  

Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Classification. The Senior Vice President has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta. 
  Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental's oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. 
  In   2016  , Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of   December 31, 2016  , in accordance with the SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s   2016   year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In   2016  , Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 18 percent of Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of Occidental s existing proved oil and gas reserves. Management retains Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental s reserve estimation and reporting process. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scott's independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. 
  Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations. 
    
  Industry Outlook 
  The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions. Average annual WTI and Brent oil price indexes for 2016 were below the 2015 averages, but ended the year higher, closing at $53.72 per barrel and $56.82 per barrel, respectively, as of   December 31, 2016  . Commodity prices remained relatively constant in early 2017. 
  Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market  

19 

conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. 
  NGLs prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region. 
  Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas. 
  These and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, NGLs and domestic gas prices reliably. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital. 

CHEMICAL SEGMENT 
  Business Environment  
  Although United States economic growth in 2016 lagged behind that of 2015, demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks remained fairly constant as natural gas and ethylene pricing was lower on average than in 2015. Historically high planned and unplanned ethylene outages, resulting in price volatility within the spot market, and rising energy costs in the last half of 2016 put pressure on chemical margins. The impact of energy and feedstock costs was partially offset by the end of 2016 as tighter supply in the caustic soda and PVC markets resulted in improved margins. 
    
  Business Review 
  Basic Chemicals 
  In 2016, the United States economic growth rate was expected to be below the 2.6 percent experienced in 2015. The lower than expected U.S. growth rate tempered domestic demand as the 2016 industry chlorine operating rate increased by only 1 percent, to 84 percent, resulting in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing. Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were relatively strong in 2016 as United States ethylene and energy costs were advantaged over global pricing. Liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in the last three quarters of 2016 as new capacity growth in the United States slowed. 
    
  Vinyls 
  Demand for domestic and export PVC improved year- over-year 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. Domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their year-over-year increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling. Export volume remains a significant portion of PVC sales representing over 30 percent of total North American  

producer s production. PVC industry operating rates in 2016 were approximately 2.3 percent higher than 2015. Industry PVC margins declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015, as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing.  
    
  Industry Outlook 
  Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Long-term weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental s products that are consumed by industry participants. Further strengthening   of the U.S. dollar may cause headwinds in the U.S. commodity export market. 
    
  Basic Chemicals 
  Continued improvement in the United States housing, automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2017. Export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2017. Overall, the low chlor-alkali operating rates driven by capacity increases over the last few years should improve as the pace of expansions have slowed considerably both domestically and globally. Improved 2016 margins from historically low values in 2015 are expected to continue as long as United States feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remain favorable compared to global feedstock costs. Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to be challenged but are expected to improve as oil prices rise. 
    
  Vinyls 
  North American demand should improve slightly in 2017 over 2016 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects. North American operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2016 but margins should improve as demand in the United States strengthens.  

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT 
  Business Environment 
  Midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing business and its processing, transportation and power generation assets. The marketing business aggregates and markets Occidental's and third-party volumes and engages in storage activities. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. Processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services. 
  The midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2016 were significantly higher than those in 2015, primarily due to impairments taken in 2015. Excluding the 2015 impairments, 2016 earnings were lower because of  

20 

unfavorable contract pricing on long-term supply agreements as well as unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, decreased throughput and  lower realized NGLs pricing. 
    
  Business Review 
  Pipeline Transportation 
  Margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped. Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline contributes significantly to Occidental's pipeline transportation results through Occidental's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin Energy. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, and up to 2.5 Bcf per day in the summer. Dolphin Pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity. Occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the Dolphin Pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows. 
  Occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,900 miles of pipelines from southeast New Mexico across the Permian Basin in west Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma. The system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 7.1 million barrels of active storage capability and 128 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline. 
  Occidental's 2016 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2015 due to lower throughput volumes.  
    
  Gas Processing Plants and CO   2    Fields and Facilities 
  Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGLs and other gas byproducts, including CO   2   , and delivers dry gas to pipelines. Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGLs. Occidental s 2016 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2015 due to lower realized NGL pricing. 
  Occidental, together with ADNOC, developed Al Hosn Gas in Abu Dhabi, of which Occidental has a 40-percent participating interest. Al Hosn Gas is designed to process 1.0 Bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, NGLs and sulfur. The processing facilities include processing and treatment facilities, sulfur recovery units, including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur. The facilities produce approximately 10,000 tons per day of sulfur, of which approximately 4,000 tons is Occidental's share. Al Hosn Gas  facilities generates revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur. The decrease in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sulfur pricing.  
    
  Power Generation Facilities 
  Earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties. The  

increase in earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 was a result of higher production due to fewer outages. 
    
  Marketing  
  The marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental s oil, NGLs and gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity. Occidental s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGLs and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. Marketing performance in 2016 declined compared to 2015 due to unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast crude oil price differentials.  
    
  Industry Outlook 
  The pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable. Marketing results can have significant volatile results depending on significant price swings, as well as Permian to Gulf Coast crude oil differentials. Occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders. The gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on NGLs prices, which cannot reasonably be predicted. Generally, higher NGLs prices result in higher profitability.  

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS 
  Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year. 
  The statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014 because of the spin-off from Occidental.

The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: 

See footnotes following significant transactions and events affecting Occidental's earnings. 
    
  The following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. 

(a) 
    Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions. 
              (b) 
    The 2016 gain on sale of assets included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties. The 2014 amount represented the gain on sale of the Hugoton properties.  
              (c) 
    The 2015 amount included approximately $1.6 billion of impairment and related charges associated with non-core domestic oil and gas assets in the Williston Basin (sold in November 2015) and Piceance Basin sold in March 2016. The remaining 2015 charges were mainly associated with the decline in commodity prices and management changes to future development plans. The 2014 amount was mainly comprised of impairment and related charges on the Williston and Piceance assets. 
              (d) 
    The 2016 amount included a net charge of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq.

              (e) 
    The 2016 amount included the gain on sale of the Occidental Tower in Dallas and a non-core specialty chemicals business. The 2015 amount represented a gain on sale of an idled facility.  
              (f) 
    The 2014 amount included a $633 million gain on sale of Occidental s interest in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, and a $1.4 billion gain on sale of a portion of Occidental s investment in Plains Pipeline.  
              (g) 
    The 2016 amount included charges related to the termination of crude oil supply contracts.The 2015 amount included an impairment charge of $814 million related to the Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO   2   .  
              (h) 
    The 2016 amount included charges of $541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and $78 million loss on the distribution of the remaining CRC stock. The 2015 amount included a $227 million other-than-temporary loss on Occidental s investment in California Resources. The 2014 amount included an $805 million impairment charge for the Joslyn oil sand project and a $553 million other-than-temporary loss on the investment in California Resources. 
              (i) 
    Represents amounts attributable to income from continuing operations after deducting a non controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014. The non controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings. 
              (j) 
    The 2016 and 2015 amounts included gains related to the Ecuador settlement. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. The 2014 amount included the results of Occidental's California operations. 
       
  Oil and Gas 

The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2016  . The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers. 

22 

23 

24 

(a) 
    Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  
       
  Oil and gas segment results were losses of $0.6 billion and $8.1 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and income of $0.4 billion in 2014. The 2016 results for the oil and gas segment included pre-tax gains of $107 million, mainly comprised of the sales of Piceance and South Texas assets, and net charges of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq.  
  Oil and gas segment results in 2015 included pre-tax impairment and related charges of $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion on domestic and international assets, respectively. Approximately $1.3 billion of the domestic impairment and related charges were due to the exit of Occidental s operations in the Williston Basin, which was sold in November 2015 and in the Piceance Basin, which was sold in March 2016. The remaining domestic charges were due to the significant decline in the futures price curve as well as management s decision not to pursue development activities associated with certain non-producing acreage. Internationally, the impairments and related charges were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce our exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable. Earnings in 2014 included pre-tax charges of $5.3 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of Hugoton assets.  
  Domestic oil and gas segment results were losses of $1.6 billion, $4.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in domestic oil and gas results in 2016, compared to 2015, reflected significantly lower realized oil prices, which had decreased by 13 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and higher DD A rates. To a lesser extent, the lower 2016 results also reflected lower oil volumes due to the sale of non-core domestic operations. The decrease in results compared to 2015 were partially offset by lower cash operating expenses.  
  Similar to domestic results, and excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in international earnings in 2016, compared to 2015, reflected significantly  

lower realized crude oil prices, which had decreased by 23 percent in the Middle East and 16 percent in Latin America partially offset by lower DD A rates.  
  Average production costs for 2016, excluding taxes other than on income, were $10.76 per BOE, compared to  
  $11.57 per BOE for 2015. The decrease in average costs reflected lower maintenance, workover and support costs as a result of improvements in operating efficiencies, especially in the domestic operations.  
  Average daily production volumes were 630,000 BOE and 668,000 BOE for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and included production from assets sold or exited of 28,000 BOE and 103,000 BOE for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding production for assets sold or exited, average daily production volumes were 602,000 BOE and 565,000 BOE for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in production from on-going operations mainly reflected higher production from Al Hosn Gas as it was not fully operational in 2015 and higher production from Permian Resources, which increased its 2016 production by 13 percent compared to 2015. These increases were offset by lower production from South Texas and Other due to curtailed drilling. 
  In addition to the impairments and related charges noted above, the decrease in domestic oil and gas segment results in 2015, compared to 2014, reflected significantly lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and lower operating costs from lower workover and maintenance costs and lower DD A expenses. The decrease in international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 
  Average daily production volumes were 668,000 BOE and 597,000 BOE for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and included 103,000 BOE and 111,000 BOE of production from assets sold or exited in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding production for assets sold or exited, average daily production volumes were 565,000 BOE and 486,000 BOE for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in on going production reflected the commencement of production at Al Hosn in 2015 along with a 47 percent increase in production from Permian Resources. 
  Average production costs for 2015, excluding taxes other than on income, were $11.57 per BOE, compared to $13.50 per BOE in 2014. The decrease in average costs reflected decreased activity in downhole maintenance and lower overall cost structure. 
    
  Chemical 

Chemical segment earnings were $571 million, $542 million and $420 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively.  Included in 2016 earnings are a pre-tax gain on sale of $57 million from the sale of the Occidental Tower building in Dallas and a $31 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a non-core specialty chemicals business.  Included in 2015 earnings are pre-tax asset impairments of $121 million and a pre-tax gain on sale of $98 million from the  

25 

sale of an idled facility. Excluding these significant items, the decrease in 2016 earnings, compared to 2015, reflected lower PVC margins as PVC pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing, which was partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs. 
  Segment earnings for 2014 included asset impairments of $149 million. Excluding these significant items, the decrease in 2015 earnings, compared to 2014  reflected lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volumes across most products, offset by improved PVC margins resulting primarily from lower energy and ethylene costs. 
    
  Midstream and Marketing 

Midstream and marketing segment results were losses of $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and earnings of $2.6 billion in 2014.  Included in 2016 results was a $160 million charge related to the  termination of crude oil supply contracts. Included in 2015 results were impairments and related charges of $1.3 billion.  Included in 2014 earnings were $2.0 billion of gains from the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and part of Occidental's investment in Plains Pipeline.  Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in 2016 results compared to 2015 reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable contract pricing on long-term supply agreements as well as unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, decreased throughput and lower realized NGLs pricing. Excluding the significant items noted above, the decrease in 2015 results, compared to 2014, primarily reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of the Permian to Gulf Coast differentials, lower domestic gas processing income due to lower NGL prices and lower Dolphin Pipeline income and the decrease in Occidental's interest in Plains Pipeline. 

TAXES 
  Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $2.3 billion, were $1.1 billion at   December 31, 2016  . The deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. 

Worldwide Effective Tax Rate 
  The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations: 

(a) 
    Represents amounts attributable to income from continuing operations after deducting a non-controlling interest amount of $14 million in 2014. The non-controlling interest amount has been netted in the midstream and marketing segment earnings.  
       
  Occidental's   2016   worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent, which is higher than the   2015   rate mainly due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income, tax credits and tax benefits resulting from the write off of exploration blocks. Excluding the impact of impairments and other nonrecurring items, Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate for 2016 would be 24 percent.  
  A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is Occidental s intention to reinvest such earnings permanently. If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $116 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Changes in components of Occidental's results of continuing operations are discussed below: 
    
  Revenue and Other Income Items 

The decrease in net sales in   2016  , compared to   2015  , was mainly due to the decline in average worldwide realized oil prices in 2016 and a decline in worldwide production as Occidental exited non-core areas. Average worldwide realized oil prices fell by approximately 18 percent from 2015 to 2016.  
  The decrease in net sales in   2015  , compared to   2014  , was due to a significant decline in worldwide oil, NGLs and gas prices, partially offset by higher domestic and international crude oil volumes. Average WTI and Brent  

26 

prices fell by nearly 50 percent and NYMEX gas prices fell by over 35 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 prices. 
  Price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment sales which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments.  
  The 2016 gain on sale included the sale of Piceance and South Texas oil and gas properties, the Occidental Tower building in Dallas, and a non-core specialty chemicals business. The 2015 gain on sale included $98 million for the sale of an idled chemical facility. The 2014 gain on sale included $1.4 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in Plains Pipeline, $633 million for the sale of BridgeTex Pipeline and $531 million for the sale of Hugoton properties. 
    
  Expense Items 

Cost of sales decreased in 2016 from the prior year due primarily to lower oil and gas maintenance costs and lower chemical feedstock and energy costs. Cost of sales decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to lower energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment, lower fuel costs in the power generation operations and lower worldwide production costs, including workovers and downhole maintenance costs. 
  Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a lower compensation accruals in 2015 related to Occidental's decision not to pay bonuses.   
  Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to lower compensation expense.  
  DD A expense decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, due to lower volumes from the exited non-core oil and gas operations and lower DD A rates in the Middle East. DD A expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014 due to higher production volumes partially offset by lower DD A rates.  
  In 2016, Occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of $825 million, of which $541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and $160 million for the termination of crude oil supply contracts, $78 million related to the disposal of CRC stock and $61 million related to exits from Libya and Iraq.  
  Asset impairments and related items in 2015 of $10.2 billion included charges of $3.5 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to Occidental s exit from the Williston and Piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain non-producing acreage.  

International oil and gas charges of $5.0 billion were due to a combination of Occidental s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain Middle East and North Africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve, which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable. Midstream charges of $1.3 billion included the impairment of Occidental s Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver CO   2   . Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $227 million for its available for sale investment in California Resources.  
  Asset impairments and related items in 2014 of $7.4 billion included $2.8 billion in the Williston basin, $904 million related to Occidental's gas and NGLs assets, $889 million for other domestic acreage and $1.1 billion primarily related to operations in Bahrain and other international operations. Asset impairments also include charges for Joslyn oil sands of $805 million and an other than temporary loss of $553 million for the available for sale investment in California Resources stock. 
  Taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to lower production taxes, which are directly tied to lower commodity prices. Taxes other than on income  in 2015 decreased from 2014 due primarily to lower oil, NGL and gas prices, which resulted in lower ad valorem and severance taxes.  
    
  Other Items 

The benefit from income taxes decreased in 2016 from the prior year as a result of a lower net loss in 2016, compared to 2015, which reflected significant impairments and related items charges. The provision for income taxes decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to the pre-tax loss in 2015 as a result of the lower price environment and impairments and related charges. 
  The decline in income from equity investments in 2016 from 2015 is the result of lower Dolphin gas sales. The decline in 2015 from 2014 is a result of the lower Dolphin gas sales, Occidental's reduced ownership in Plains Pipeline and the expiration of Occidental's contract in Yemen Block 10, where Occidental held an equity interest. 
  Discontinued operations, net in 2016 and 2015 of $428 and $317 million, respectively, primarily include settlement payments by the Republic of Ecuador. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION 
  The changes in select components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below: 

Assets  
  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
  The increase in trade receivables, net, was the result of improved oil and gas prices at the end of 2016, compared to the end of 2015. Average December WTI and Brent prices were below $40.00 per barrel in 2015 compared to over $50.00 per barrel in 2016. Inventories decreased as a result of lower materials and supplies inventories in the oil and gas segment. The decrease in assets held for sale is the result of the sale of Piceance oil and gas properties and the Dallas Tower office building. Other current assets increased as a result of receivables recorded for federal and state tax refunds anticipated on the net loss carryback. The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture, which were partially offset by distributions from Dolphin Energy and Plains All American Pipeline Company. The decrease in the available for sale investment is due to the complete distribution of Occidental's retained interest in California Resources as a special stock dividend in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in PP E, net, was due to capital expenditures and the fourth quarter Permian acquisitions, which were partially offset by DD A. 
    
  Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity 
  The increase in accounts payable reflected higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015. Liabilities of assets held for sale were transferred with the sale of the Piceance properties in the first quarter of 2016. 

The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes was due to the decrease in the difference between the book and tax basis of Occidental's oil and gas properties. The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to the additional asset retirement obligation (ARO) recorded related to the Permian acquisitions and newly drilled wells and additional environmental liabilities recorded for Maxus indemnified sites. The decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends and the 2016 net loss.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  At   December 31, 2016  , Occidental had approximately   $2.2 billion   in cash and cash equivalents. A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States. Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs.  
  Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance resulting from the spin-off of California Resources in the first quarter of 2016 to retire debt and pay dividends. 
  In November 2016, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, comprised of $750 million of 3.0-percent senior notes due 2027 and $750 million of 4.1-percent senior notes due 2047. Occidental received net proceeds of $1.49 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August each year for each series of senior notes beginning August 15, 2017. Occidental will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior note offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016.  
  In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016. Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and will use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  In February 2016, Occidental retired $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that had matured. 
  In June 2015, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of debt that was comprised of $750 million of 3.50-percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750 million of 4.625-percent senior unsecured notes due 2045. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $1.48 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year for both series of notes, beginning on December 15, 2015.  
  In August 2014, Occidental entered into a new five-year, $2.0 billion bank credit facility (Credit Facility) in order to replace its previous $2.0 billion bank credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in October 2016. The 2014 Credit  

28 

Facility does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow under this facility. Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the Credit Facility during   2016   or 2015 and no amounts were outstanding as of   December 31, 2016  .  
  As of   December 31, 2016  , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.  
  Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments and through future borrowings, and if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance. 
    
  Cash Flow Analysis  

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 decreased $0.7 billion to $2.5 billion, from $3.3 billion in 2015. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide average realized oil prices in the first half of 2016, which on a year-over-year basis declined 18 percent. The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs, especially in the oil and gas segment where year over year production costs decreased by 7 percent. Cash flows from continuing operations in 2016 also included collections of $325 million of federal and state tax refunds. The usage of working capital in 2016 reflected an increase in receivables as oil prices were much higher at the end of 2016, compared to the end of 2015.  Operating cash flows from discontinued operations reflected the collection of the Ecuador settlement.  
  Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 decreased $5.6 billion to $3.3 billion, from $8.9 billion in 2014. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide realized oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices throughout 2015, which on a year-over-year basis declined 48 percent, 57 percent, and 42 percent, respectively. The effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by higher production and lower operating costs. The usage of working capital in 2015 reflected lower realized prices that impacted receivable collections and payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in 2015.  
  Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. Changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes  

in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs. 
  The chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment. 

Occidental s net capital expenditures declined by $2.7 billion in 2016 to $2.9 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities. The decline was a result of the oil and gas budget reduction due to lower commodity price environment and reductions in spending on long-term projects such as the OxyChem Ingleside facility, which is expected to come on line in early 2017. 
  Occidental's net capital expenditures declined $3.1 billion in 2015 to $5.6 billion, after contributions to the OxyChem Ingleside facility which was included in other  investing activities. The decline was the result of lower spending in oil and gas non-core operations in the United States and Middle East and reduced expenditures on long-term projects coming on line at the end of 2014.  
  While the 2017 environment remains challenging, Occidental remains committed to allocating capital to only its highest return projects. Occidental's 2017 capital spending is expected to be in the range of $3.0 billion to $3.6 billion. 
  In 2016, cash flows used in other investing activities of $2.0 billion is comprised primarily of the acquisition of  acreage in the Permian in October 2016.  
  In 2015, cash flows used in other investing activities of $0.1 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets.  
  Capital commitments for long-term projects currently under construction in the midstream and chemicals segment in 2017 are planned to be approximately $140 million. 

29 

Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was $0.4 billion, as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of $1.5 billion. Financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from long term debt of $4.2 billion and payments of long term debt of $2.7 billion. Occidental used restricted cash of $1.2 billion to pay dividends and retire debt.  
  Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $1.5 billion, as compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 of $2.2 billion. Financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from long term debt of $1.5 billion. Occidental used restricted cash of $2.8 billion to pay dividends and purchase treasury stock.  

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of Occidental's off-balance-sheet arrangements. 
  Guarantees 
  Occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $296 million of Dolphin s debt. The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.  
  Occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit, indemnities and commitments.  
  See "Oil and Gas Segment   Business Review   Qatar" and  Segment Results of Operations  for further information about Dolphin. 
  Leases 
  Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space. Occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility. Lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. For more information, see "Contractual Obligations." 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  The table below summarizes and cross-references Occidental s contractual obligations. This summary indicates on- and off-balance-sheet obligations as of   December 31, 2016  . 

(b) 
    Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, accrued transportation commitments and other accrued liabilities. 
              (c) 
    Amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, drilling rigs and services, CO   2,    electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.  Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.7 percent discount rate.  
       
  Delivery Commitments 
  Occidental has commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs. The domestic volumes contracted to be delivered, which are not presented in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements, are approximately 81 million barrels of oil through 2025, 5 Bcf of gas through 2017 and 11 million barrels of NGLs through 2018. The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product. Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.  

LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES  
  Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases,  

30 

compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.  
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy these criteria. Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation, that satisfy these criteria as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental s consolidated balance sheets.  
  Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.  
    
  Tax Matters 
  During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS review. Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Indemnities to Third Parties  
  Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.  These indemnities usually are contingent upon  

the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.  As of December 31, 2016, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves. 

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES 
  Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.  
  The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 147 sites. The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($131 million in 2016, $70 million in 2015, and $79 million in 2014) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities   other ($739 million in 2016, $316 million in 2015, and $255 million in 2014). The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL) sites and three categories of non-NPL sites   third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 

As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 16 of the 147 sites  

31 

described above, and 88 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each. 
  As of December 31, 2016, three sites   the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio(both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York   accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites. The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.  
  Four of the 68 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 53 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites. The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.  
  Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, and Texas accounted for 48 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites. 
  Six other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania   accounted for 69 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 
  When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site. Occidental is pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of Maxus, to recover all indemnified costs, which will include costs to be incurred at the Site. 
  In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.  During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million. The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.  
  Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites. Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental  

continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties. 
  Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.  
  Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years. Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $1.0 billion. 
    
  Environmental Costs 
  Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31: 

Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by Occidental. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations. 
  Occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $89 million for   2017  .  

FOREIGN INVESTMENTS 
  Many of Occidental s assets are located outside North America. At   December 31, 2016  , the carrying value of Occidental s assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $9.5 billion, or 22 percent of Occidental s total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $8.2 billion are located in the Middle East and approximately $1.0 billion are located in Latin America. For the year ended   December 31, 2016  , net sales outside North America totaled $3.7 billion, or approximately 37 percent of total net sales. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  

32 

requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. There has been no material change to Occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment. 
    
  Oil and Gas Properties 
  The carrying value of Occidental s PP E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges. For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. 
  Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete. 
  Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred. 
  Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves. 
  Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. 

Several factors could change Occidental s proved oil and gas reserves. For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. In   2016  , positive revisions of previous estimates of 159 million BOE were primarily positive technical revisions in Al Hosn Gas and price revisions in Oman due to the PSC impact, partially offset by negative domestic price revisions.  
  Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs. It is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.  
  The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD A rate. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD A rate by approximately $0.60 per barrel, which would  

33 

increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $140 million annually at current production rates.  
  A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion at   December 31, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties. Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property. If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed. The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance. 
    
  Chemical Assets 
  Occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA). Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul. Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use. These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service. The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively. 
  Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes. 
  Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets. Any impairment  

loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value. 
  Occidental's net PP E for the chemical segment is approximately $2.4 billion and its depreciation expense for 2017 is expected to be approximately $300 million. The most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of Occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $45 million per year. 
    
  Midstream, Marketing and Other Assets 
  Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty. Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment. Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period. For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged. Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item. Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
  A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument. In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss. Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable. 
  Occidental's midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method. Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets. Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value. 

34 

Fair Value Measurements 
  Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1   using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2   using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3   using unobservable inputs.  Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period. 
    
  Fair Values - Recurring 
  Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods: 
             
    Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as Level 1.  
         Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  
             
    Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.  
       
  Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.  This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 
    
  Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures 
  Environmental expenditures that relate to current  

operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established. The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established. Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis. Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.  
  Many factors could affect Occidental s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.  
  Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability. Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of  

35 

such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved. 
  In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at NPL sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.  
  If Occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $87 million. If the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $87 million. 
    
  Other Loss Contingencies 
  Occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis. 
  Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors. See "Lawsuits, Claims and Contingencies" for additional information. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES 
  See Note 3, Accounting and Disclosure Changes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  

SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA 
  Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2, "Business and Properties," Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "might," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "aim,"  

"goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere. 

ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     
  Commodity Price Risk 
  General 
  Occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental s pre-tax annual income by approximately $120 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGLs prices. If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental's pre-tax income of approximately $50 million. These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to prices also will change. Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities. These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably. 
  Occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively. A variation in PVC prices of   $0.01   per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins. According to IHS Chemical or Townsend,   2016   average contract prices were: chlorine $298 per ton; caustic soda $645 per ton; and PVC $0.38 per lb. 
  Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.  
     
  Risk Management 
  Occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies. The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check. Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer. Controls for these activities include limits  

36 

on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management of various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.  
     
  Fair Value of Marketing Derivative Contracts 
  Occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value. Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources. The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant.  
  The following table shows the fair value of Occidental's derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation: 

Cash-Flow Hedges 
  Occidental s marketing operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s North American leased storage facilities. At December 31, 2016, Occidental had approximately 7  Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 Bcf of stored natural gas.  
     
  Quantitative Information 
  Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities. This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice. As a result of these controls, Occidental has determined that market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.   
     
  Interest Rate Risk 
  General 
  Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variable-rate long-term debt obligations. As of   December 31, 2016  , variable-rate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of Occidental's total debt. 
     
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  Occidental s foreign operations have limited currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by  

balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes. A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency. As of   December 31, 2016  , the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. 
    
  Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk 
  The table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations. Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date. 

(a) 
    Excludes unamortized debt discounts of   $36 million   and debt issuance cost of $52 million. 
       
  Credit Risk 
  The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.  
  Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post. Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  . 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at   December 31, 2016   was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Occidental Petroleum Corporation: 
    
  We have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Occidental Petroleum Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated     statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 1 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
  In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates. Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  
    
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures. Occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, by reporting its proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. 
  Certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   presentation.  
  As a result of the spin-off of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) the statements of income and cash flows related to California Resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014. See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources for additional information.  
    
  INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES 
  Occidental s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates as to which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest (excluding oil and gas ventures in which Occidental holds an undivided interest) are accounted for under the equity method. Occidental reviews equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. The amount of impairment, if any, is based on quoted market prices, when available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.  
    
  REVENUE RECOGNITION 
  Revenue is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped. In international locations where oil is shipped by tanker, title passes when the tanker is loaded or product is received by the customer, depending on the shipping terms. This process occasionally causes a difference between actual production in a reporting period and sales volumes that have been recognized as revenue. Revenues from the production of oil and gas properties in which Occidental has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Occidental s net revenue interest. 
  Revenue from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer. Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product purchased over a defined period. Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period. Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted. 
  Revenue from marketing activities is recognized on net settled transactions upon completion of contract terms and, for physical deliveries, upon title transfer. For unsettled transactions, contracts are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in net sales. Revenue from all marketing activities is reported on a net basis. 
  Occidental records revenue net of any taxes, such as sales taxes, that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers. 
    
  RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
  The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances. Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement. Management believes that these estimates and judgments provide  

46 

a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial statements. Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods. Realization of deferred tax assets, including any net operating loss carryforwards, is dependent upon Occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate. 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $9.5 billion as of   December 31, 2016  , and net sales of approximately $3.7 billion for the year ended   December 31, 2016  , relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside North America. Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced political instability, nationalizations, corruption, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security problems, labor unrest, OPEC production restrictions, equipment import restrictions and sanctions, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss, delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences. Occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization. 
  Because Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on Occidental s results of operations. 
  Also, see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below. 
    
  CASH EQUIVALENTS 
  Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash. Cash equivalents were approximately $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion at   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  RESTRICTED CASH 
  Restricted cash is the result of the separation of California Resources in 2014. As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   $1.2 billion   of cash restricted for the payment of dividends, payment of debt or share repurchases. In 2016, Occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends. 
    
  INVESTMENTS 
  Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (AOCI). Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains or losses included in net sales.  
  A decline in market value of any available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, Occidental considers all available information relevant to the investment, including past events and current conditions. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in. 
    
  INVENTORIES 
  Materials and supplies are valued at weighted-average cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence. Oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. 
  For the chemical segment, Occidental's finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. For most of its domestic inventories, other than materials and supplies, the chemical segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches current costs and current revenue. For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out method (if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable). 
    
  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
  Oil and Gas 
  The carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and any impairment charges. For assets acquired, PP E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. 
  Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. Otherwise, Occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a   12  -month period after drilling is complete. 

47 

The following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for continuing operations for the years ended December 31: 

Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred. 
  Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method.  It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves, and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves. 
  Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. 
  Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs. See Note 15 and below for further discussion of asset impairments.  
  A portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.4 billion and $0.3 billion at   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A until they are classified as proved properties. Capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to DD A when proved reserves are assigned to the property. If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed. The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results.  
    
  Chemical 
  Occidental s chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from   three   years to   fifty   years, are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (PMMA). Ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. PMMA costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul. Additionally, Occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use. These capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service. The resulting revision, if any, of the asset s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively. 
  Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes. 
  Occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be  

48 

recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets. Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value. 
    
  Midstream and Marketing 
  Occidental s midstream and marketing PP E is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method. 
  Occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets. Any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset s net book value over its estimated fair value. 
  Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - using unobservable inputs. Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period. 
    
  IMPAIRMENTS AND RELATED ITEMS 
  In 2016, Occidental recorded net impairment and related charges of $61 million related to the sale of Libya and exit from Iraq and the termination of crude oil supply contracts at a cost of $160 million. The corporate amount included an allowance for doubtful accounts. 
  In 2015, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges on oil and gas assets due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the decision to sell or exit non-core assets and changes in development plans for its non-producing assets. In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota and in December 2015, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado. In Iraq, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal and reassigned its interest in the Zubair Field in accordance with the contract terms. In Bahrain, Occidental issued a notice of withdrawal, reassigning its interest, and completed the exit in 2016. In Yemen, Occidental s non-operated interest in Block 10 East Shabwa Field expired in December 2015, and in February 2016, Occidental sold its interests in Block S-1, An Nagyah Field. 
  In 2015, the midstream and marketing segment recorded an impairment charge for the Century gas processing plant as a result of SandRidge's inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet its contractual obligations to deliver CO   2   .  
  In 2014, Occidental recorded impairment and related charges mainly for Williston, Bahrain, the Joslyn oil sands project and other non-core domestic gas properties due to declining prices and changes in development plans.  

(a) 
    A portion of the 2015 charges are reported in the Midstream and Marketing segment.  

49 

It is reasonably possible that prolonged or further declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments.  
    
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1   using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2   using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3   using unobservable inputs. Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period. 
    
  Fair Values - Recurring 
  Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. Occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods: 
             
    Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as Level 1.  
                
    Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  
                
    Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace, or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. 
     Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability. This approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 
    
  ACCRUED LIABILITIES CURRENT  
  Accrued liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $341 million and $188 million at   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES 
  Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. Occidental bases environmental reserves on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established. The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established. Presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis.  Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.  
  Many factors could affect Occidental's future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.  

50 

Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of the other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability. Occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved. 
  In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) National Priorities List (NPL) sites, Occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly. 
    
  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
  Occidental recognizes the fair value of asset retirement obligations in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment, technological changes, future inflation rates and the risk-adjusted discount rate. When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, Occidental records an adjustment to both the asset retirement obligation and PP E. Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for accretion, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
   At a certain number of its facilities, Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations that are related mainly to plant decommissioning. Occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations. Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities. Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values. 
  The following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $1.2 billion is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at both   December 31, 2016   and   2015  . 

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty. Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment. Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period. For cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged. Realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item. Gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  . 
  A hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by   80   to   125   percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument. In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss. Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed probable. 

51 

STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS 
  Occidental has established several stockholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees and directors (Plans) that are more fully described in Note 12. A summary of Occidental s accounting policy for awards issued under the Plans is as follows. 
  For cash- and stock-settled restricted stock units or incentive award shares (RSUs) and capital employed incentive awards and return on assets (ROCEI/ROAI), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock and the estimated payout at the grant date. For total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs), compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using estimated payout levels derived from a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation expense for RSUs, ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally over the awards  respective vesting or performance periods. Compensation expense for the dividends accrued on unvested awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in stock price and the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria, if applicable. All such performance or stock-price-related changes are recognized in periodic compensation expense. The stock-settled portion of these awards is expensed using the initially measured compensation value. 
    
  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method. 
  Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares and share units. The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock awards. 
    
  RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
  Occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, which are more fully described in Note 13, in its financial statements using a December 31 measurement date. 
  Occidental determines its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations based on various assumptions and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions used are meant to reflect the interest rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. Occidental estimates the rate of return on assets with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns. Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements. 
  Pension and any postretirement plan assets are measured at fair value. Common stock, preferred stock, publicly registered mutual funds, U.S. government securities and corporate bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets when available. When quoted market prices are not available, these investments are valued using pricing models with observable inputs from both active and non-active markets. Common and collective trusts are valued at the fund units' net asset value (NAV) provided by the issuer, which represents the quoted price in a non-active market. Short-term investment funds are valued at the fund units' NAV provided by the issuer. 
    
  SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
  Occidental paid United States federal, state and foreign income taxes for continuing operations of approximately   $0.3 billion  ,   $1.0 billion   and   $2.9 billion   during the years ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. Occidental also paid production, property and other taxes of approximately   $343 million  ,   $445 million   and   $610 million   during the years ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, substantially all of which was in the United States. Interest paid totaled approximately   $312 million  ,   $246 million   and   $219 million  , net of capitalized interest of   $64 million  ,   $138 million   and   $180 million  , for the years   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
    
  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS  
  The functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the United States dollar since cash flows are denominated principally in United States dollars. In Occidental's other operations, Occidental's use of non-United States dollar functional currencies was not material for all years presented. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. Occidental reports the exchange rate differences arising from translating foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts to the United States dollar as of the reporting date in other comprehensive income. Exchange-rate gains and losses for continuing operations were not material for all years presented.

  In August 2016, Occidental terminated crude oil supply contracts at a cost of $160 million.  
  In the second quarter of 2016, Occidental received $330 million as final payment from the settlement with the Republic of Ecuador. In January 2016, Occidental reached an understanding on the terms of payment for the approximate $1.0 billion payable to Occidental by the Republic of Ecuador under a November 2015 International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes arbitration award. This award relates to Ecuador's 2006 expropriation of Occidental's Participation Contract for Block 15. Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain of $681 million in the first quarter of 2016. The results related to Ecuador were presented as discontinued operations. 
  In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior notes offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016. 
  In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016. Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  In March 2016, Occidental distributed its remaining shares of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) through a special stock dividend to stockholders of record as of February 29, 2016. Upon distribution, Occidental recorded a $78 million loss to reduce the investment to its fair market value, and Occidental no longer owns any shares of California Resources common stock.  
  In March 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for $153 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $121 million. The assets and liabilities related to these operations were presented as held for sale at December 31, 2015, and primarily included property, plant and equipment and current accrued liabilities and asset retirement obligations.  
  In February 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that matured. 
  In January 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Occidental Tower building in Dallas, Texas, for net proceeds of approximately $85 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $57 million. The building was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  2015 
  In January 2016, Occidental reached an understanding on the terms of payment for the approximate $1.0 billion payable to Occidental by the Republic of Ecuador under a November 2015 International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes arbitration award. This award relates to Ecuador's 2006 expropriation of Occidental's Participation Contract for Block 15. As of December 31, 2015, Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain of $322 million. The result of this settlement with Ecuador has been presented as discontinued operations.  
  In December 2015, Occidental entered a sales agreement to sell its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for approximately $155 million. The transaction was completed in March 2016. As a result of exiting the Piceance Basin operations Occidental recorded certain contractual liabilities which are included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other on the consolidated balance sheet. The assets and liabilities related to these operations are presented as held for sale at December 31, 2015 and primarily include property, plant and equipment and current accrued liabilities and asset retirement obligations. 
  In November 2015, Occidental sold its Williston Basin assets in North Dakota for approximately $590 million. 
  In October 2015, Occidental completed the sale of its Westwood building in Los Angeles, California for net proceeds of $65 million.  
  In June 2015, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of debt that was comprised of $750 million of 3.50-percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750 million of 4.625-percent senior unsecured notes due 2045. Occidental received net proceeds of  

53 

approximately $1.48 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year for both series of notes, beginning on December 15, 2015.  
    
  2014 
  In December 2014, Occidental spent $1.3 billion on an acquisition in the Permian Basin totaling approximately 100,000 net acres. The assets acquired include primarily unproved oil and gas property leases and the related existing lease contracts, permits, licenses, easements, and equipment located on the properties. 
  On November 30, 2014, Occidental's California oil and gas operations and related assets was spun-off through the pro rata distribution of 81.3 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of California Resources, creating an independent, publicly traded company. See Note 17 Spin-off of California Resources Corporation.  
  In November 2014, Occidental entered into an agreement with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (Plains Pipeline), and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to sell its interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC (BridgeTex), which owns the BridgeTex Pipeline. The sale of Occidental's interest in BridgeTex included two transactions: Plains Pipeline purchased Occidental's interest in BridgeTex for $1.075 billion, and Magellan acquired Occidental's interest in the southern leg of the BridgeTex Pipeline for $75 million. Occidental recognized a pre-tax gain of $633 million. 
  Concurrent with the sale of its interest in the BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, Occidental sold a portion of Plains Pipeline for pre-tax proceeds of $1.7 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.4 billion. 
  In February 2014, Occidental entered into an agreement to sell its Hugoton Field operations in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado for pre-tax proceeds of $1.4 billion. The transaction was completed in April 2014 and, after taking into account purchase price adjustments, it resulted in pre-tax proceeds of $1.3 billion. Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $531 million.  

NOTE 3 
    ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES 

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES 
    
  In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance related to the cash flow classification and presentation of the changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial statements.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.  
  In March, April, and May of 2016, the FASB issued rules clarifying several aspects of the new revenue recognition standard, previously issued in May 2014. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods and services. The new standard also requires more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Occidental will not early adopt the standard, and plans to use a modified retrospective approach upon adoption, with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application subject to certain additional disclosures. Occidental has started the assessment process by evaluating its revenue streams and evaluating contracts under the revised standards. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact the standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. These rules are designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting and cash flow classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (2) forfeitures, and (3) tax withholding requirements and cash flow classification. The rules were adopted for the second quarter of 2016 and did not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to eliminate the requirement to retrospectively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The rules became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued rules clarifying that a change in one of the parties to a derivative contract that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require dedesignation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The rules became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. These rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements. 

54 

In February 2016, the FASB issued rules which require Occidental to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The new rules require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The lease liability represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for most leases. The guidance retains the current accounting for lessors and does not make significant changes to the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows by a lessee. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Occidental is the lessee under various agreements for real estate, equipment, plants and facilities, aircraft, and vehicles that are currently accounted for as operating leases, refer to Note 6, Lease Commitments. As a result, these new rules will increase reported assets and liabilities. Occidental will not early adopt this standard. Occidental will apply the revised lease rules for our interim and annual reporting periods starting January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach, including several optional practical expedients related to leases commenced before the effective date. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements and has started the assessment process by evaluating the population of leases under the revised definition. The quantitative impacts of the new standard are dependent on the leases in force at the time of adoption. As a result, the evaluation of the effect of the new standards will extend over future periods.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued rules simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new rules require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Occidental adopted these rules retrospectively as of January 1, 2016. These rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.  

NOTE 4 
    INVENTORIES 

Net carrying values of inventories valued under the LIFO method were approximately   $192 million   and   $189 million   at   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Inventories consisted of the following: 

55 

NOTE 5 
    LONG-TERM DEBT 

Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Occidental has a bank credit facility (Credit Facility) with a $2.0 billion commitment expiring in 2019. No amounts have been drawn under this Credit Facility. Up to $1.0 billion of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings. Additionally, Occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.08 percent in   2016   on the total commitment amounts of the Credit Facility. 
  The Credit Facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur. The Credit Facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt. 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock. 
  In November 2016, Occidental issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, comprised of $750 million of 3.0-percent senior notes due 2027 and $750 million of 4.1-percent senior notes due 2047. Occidental received net proceeds of $1.49 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August each year for each series of senior notes beginning August 15, 2017. Occidental will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
  In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016 senior notes offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes that matured in June 2016.  
  In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2 billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately $2.72 billion. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in April and October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016. Occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.  
  In February 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that matured. 
  Occidental has provided guarantees on Dolphin Energy's debt, which are limited to certain political and other events. At   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , Occidental s total guarantees were not material and a substantial majority of the amounts consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $296 million and $318 million, respectively, of Dolphin s debt. The fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.  

56 

At   December 31, 2016  , principal payments on long-term debt aggregated approximately $9.9 billion, of which zero is due in 2017, $0.5 billion is due in 2018, $0.1 billion is due in 2019, zero is due in 2020, $1.3 billion is due in 2021 and $8 billion is due in 2022 and thereafter. 
  Occidental estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such instruments' maturities. The estimated fair values of Occidental s debt at   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , substantially all of which were classified as Level 1, were approximately $10.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, compared to carrying values of approximately $9.8 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Occidental's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable-rate, long-term debt obligations, and is not material. As of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , variable-rate debt constituted approximately one percent of Occidental's total debt. 

NOTE 6 
    LEASE COMMITMENTS 

Operating lease agreements include leases for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space. Occidental s operating lease agreements frequently include renewal or purchase options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses. At   December 31, 2016  , future net minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following: 

Rental expense for operating leases was $237 million in   2016  , $197 million in   2015   and $155 million in   2014  .  

NOTE 7 
    DERIVATIVES 

Objective   Strategy 
  Occidental uses a variety of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts, including those designated as cash flow hedges, to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, transportation commitments and to fix margins on the future sale of stored volumes of oil and natural gas. Where Occidental buys product for its own consumption or sells its production to a defined customer, Occidental elects normal purchases and normal sales exclusions. Occidental usually applies cash flow hedge accounting treatment to derivative financial instruments to lock in margins on the forecasted sales of its natural gas storage volumes, and at times for other strategies to lock in margins. Occidental also enters into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes; however, the results of any transactions are immaterial to the marketing portfolio. Refer to Note 1 for Occidental s accounting policy on derivatives.  
  The financial instruments, not designated as hedges, will impact Occidental's earnings through mark-to-market until the offsetting future physical commodity is delivered.  For GAAP purposes, any physical inventory is carried at lower of cost or market on the balance sheet.  A substantial majority of Occidental's physical derivative contracts are index-based and carry no mark-to-market value in earnings. Net gains and losses associated with derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in net sales. Net gains and losses attributable to derivatives instruments subject to hedge accounting reside in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings as the transactions to which the derivatives relate are recognized in earnings. 
    
  Cash-Flow Hedges 
  Occidental s marketing operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental s leased storage facilities. Derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes. These agreements continue through 2017. As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 7 Bcf of stored natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately 13 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecasted sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 Bcf of stored natural gas. The amount of cash-flow hedges, including the ineffective portion was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  The following table summarizes the amounts reported in net sales related to the outstanding commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015: 

Fair Value of Derivatives 
  Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 - using unobservable inputs. Transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period. The following summarizes the fair value of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities by input level within the fair-value hierarchy:

Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $3 million as of December 31, 2015, deposited by Occidental, has not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables. This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts do not include collateral.  
       
  Credit Risk 
  The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis. 
  Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post. Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-posting requirements as of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  . The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was immaterial for both December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 8 
    ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES 

Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.  
  The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 147 sites. The following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves as of   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($131 million in 2016, $70 million in 2015, and $79 million in 2014)  

59 

and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities   other ($739 million in 2016, $316 million in 2015, and $255 million in 2014). The reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA NPL sites and three categories of non-NPL sites   third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 

As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 16 of the 147 sites described above, and 88 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each. 
  As of December 31, 2016, three sites   the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below), and a landfill in Western New York   accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with NPL sites. The reserve balance above includes 17 NPL sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.  
  Four of the 68 third-party sites a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, an active plant outside of the United States and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 53 percent of Occidental s reserves associated with these sites. The reserve balance above includes 9 third-party sites subject to indemnification by Maxus.  
  Three sites chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, and Texas accounted for 48 percent of the reserves associated with the Occidental-operated sites. 
  Six other sites a landfill in western New York, former chemical plants in Tennessee, Delaware, Washington and California, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania accounted for 69 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 
  When Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site. Occidental is pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of Maxus, to recover all indemnified costs, which will include costs to be incurred at the Site. 
  In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay.  During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million. The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.  
  Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites. Occidental s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties.  
  Environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation.  
  Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years. Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $1.0 billion. 

60 

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS 
  Occidental s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31: 

Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in  properties currently operated by Occidental. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations. 

NOTE 9 
    LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.  
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In Note 8, Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria. Reserve balances for matters, other than environmental remediation, that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental s consolidated balance sheets.  
  Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.  
    
  Tax Matters 
    
  During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Although taxable years through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Additionally, in December 2012, Occidental filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS review. Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. In certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental s income taxes. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

61 

Indemnities to Third Parties  
    
  Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.  These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.  As of December 31, 2016, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves. 
    
  OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. At   December 31, 2016  , total purchase obligations were $8.9 billion, which included approximately $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion, $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion that will be paid in   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  ,   2020   and   2021  , respectively. Included in the purchase obligations are commitments for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures during   2017   and thereafter, which were approximately $0.5 billion. 

NOTE 10 
    DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES 

The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows: 

The provisions (credits) for domestic and foreign income taxes on continuing operations consisted of the following: 

The following reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to Occidental s worldwide effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is stated as a percentage of pre-tax income: 

62 

The tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at   December 31, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Total deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion as of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. The reduction in the net deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to the addition of deferred tax benefits associated with various tax credit carryforwards as well as a net reduction in the deferred tax asset related to the allowance for bad debts. 
  Occidental had, as of   December 31, 2016  , foreign tax credit carryforward of $2.0 billion, which expire in varying amounts through 2026, and various state operating loss carryforwards, which have varying carryforward periods through 2036. In addition, Occidental had, as of December 31, 2016, alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $226 million, that do not expire, and $186 million of general business credit carryforwards that expire between 2023 and 2036. Occidental's valuation allowance provides for substantially all of the foreign tax credit. 
  A deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $8.5 billion, net of foreign taxes, at   December 31, 2016   , as it is Occidental s intention to reinvest such earnings permanently. If the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $116 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits. 
  Discontinued operations include income tax charges of $249 million, $1 million, and $454 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $22 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities   other, all of which, if subsequently recognized, would favorably affect Occidental s effective tax rate. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

Management believes it is unlikely that Occidental s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to existing matters would increase or decrease within the next 12 months by a material amount. Occidental cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various audits.  
  Occidental has recognized $761 million and $297 million in income tax receivables at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded in other current assets.  
  Occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods. See Note 9 for a discussion of these matters. 
  Occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes and these amounts were not material for the years ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  .

    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 

The following is a summary of common stock issuances: 

TREASURY STOCK 
  On October 2, 2014, Occidental increased the total number of shares authorized for its share repurchase program by 60 million shares to 185 million shares total; however, the program does not obligate Occidental to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. No shares were purchased under the program in 2016. In   2015   Occidental purchased 7.4 million shares under the program at an average cost of $76.99 per share. Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan during each year. As of   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , treasury stock shares numbered 128.0 million, 127.7 million and 120.0 million, respectiv  ely. 
    
  NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK 
  Occidental has authorized   50,000,000   shares of preferred stock with a par value of   $1.00   per share. At   December 31, 2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , Occidental had   no   outstanding shares of preferred stock.

NOTE 12 
    STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS 

Occidental has established several plans that allow it to issue stock-based awards including in the form of RSUs, stock options (Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), ROCEI/ROAI and TSRIs. An aggregate of   35 million   shares of Occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 4.5 million shares had been allocated to employee awards through   December 31, 2016  . In accordance with the terms of the shareholder approved 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), awards issued under the superseded 2005 LTIP and subsequently forfeited after adoption of the 2015 LTIP increase the shares available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 30 million shares were available for grants of future awards. The plan requires each share covered by an award (other than Options and SARs) to be counted as if three shares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards. Accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 30 million depending on the type of award granted. Additionally, under the plan, the shares available for future awards may increase, depending on the award type, by the number of shares currently unvested or forfeitable, or three times that number as applicable, that (i) fail to vest, (ii) are forfeited or canceled, or (iii) correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash, including awards that were issued under a previous plan that remain outstanding. 
  During   2016  , non-employee directors were granted awards for 23,888 shares of common stock. Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the closing quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time. 
  The following table summarizes total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31:  

As of   December 31, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards was $231 million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. 
    
  RSUs 
  Certain employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs, some of which have performance criteria based on net income or earnings per share, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of Occidental common stock. Depending on their terms, RSUs are settled in cash or stock at the time of vesting. These awards vest from one to four years following the grant date, however, certain of the RSUs are forfeitable if performance objectives are not satisfied by the seventh anniversary of the grant date. For certain RSUs, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period. For those awards that cliff vest between one to three years, dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting or performance period, as appropriate, and are paid upon vesting or performance certification, as appropriate. 
  The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled RSUs granted in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   were $75.57, $72.64, and $100.95 per share, respectively. The weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled RSUs granted in   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   were $74.82, $72.54, and $101.77, respectively.  Cash-Settled RSUs resulted in payments of $41 million, $39 million, and $64 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.   The fair value of RSUs settled in shares during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $31 million, $28 million, and $56 million, respectively.  

65 

A summary of changes in Occidental s unvested cash- and stock-settled RSUs during the year ended   December 31, 2016   is presented below:  

TSRIs 
  Certain executives are awarded TSRIs that vest at the end of a three-year period following the grant date. Payout is based upon Occidental's total shareholder return performance relative to its peers and the S P 500. TSRIs granted in 2016 and 2015 have payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award. TSRIs granted in July 2014 have payouts that range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award; all outstanding TSRIs settle fully in stock once certified. Dividend equivalents for TSRIs are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award. The fair value of TSRIs settled in shares during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $8 million, $14 million, and zero, respectively.  
  The fair values of TSRIs are initially determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies. The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term). The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon T-notes (US Treasury Strip) at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date. Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental. 
    
  The grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of TSRIs were as follows: 

A summary of Occidental s unvested TSRIs as of   December 31, 2016  , and changes during the year ended   December 31, 2016  , is presented below:  

(a) 
    Presented at the target payouts. 
       
  STOCK OPTIONS AND SARs 
  Certain employees have been granted Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) or Options that are settled in stock. Exercise prices of the Options were equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date. No options were granted in 2016. The intrinsic value of options and stock-settled SARs exercised during the years ended   December 31, 2016  , 2015,  

66 

and 2014 was $1 million, zero, and $5 million, respectively. In 2014, cash payments of $26 million were made for cash - settled SAR awards granted in 2004. In 2015 and 2016 no cash based SAR awards were granted or outstanding. 
  The fair value of each Option or stock-settled SAR is initially measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The expected life is estimated based on the vesting and expiration terms of the award. The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on US Treasury Strips at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the measured instrument. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date. Estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental. 
  The following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during the year ended   December 31, 2016  : 

ROCEI / ROAI 
  Occidental grants share-equivalents to certain employees that vest at the end of a three-year period if performance targets based on return on assets of the applicable segment or return on capital employed are certified as being met. These awards are settled in stock upon certification of the performance target, with payouts that range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award.  

NOTE 13 
    RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 

Occidental has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees. 
    
  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS 
  All domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, level and employee contributions. Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits. The accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were   $163 million   and $175 million as of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and Occidental expensed   $113 million   in   2016  , $136 million in   2015   and $146 million in   2014   under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.  
    
  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS 
  Participation in defined benefit plans is limited and approximately   600   domestic and   1,100   foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans. 
  Pension costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees. 

67 

POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS 
  Occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents. Occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year. These  benefit costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately   $182 million   in   2016  ,   $200 million   in   2015   and   $215 million   in   2014  . 
    
  OBLIGATIONS AND FUNDED STATUS 
  The following tables show the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of Occidental related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and their funding status, obligations and plan asset fair values:  

The following table sets forth details of the obligations and assets of Occidental's defined benefit pension plans: 

Occidental does not expect any plan assets to be returned during   2017  . 

68 

COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST 
  The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit costs: 

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $10 million and zero, respectively. The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $15 million and $1 million, respectively. 
    
  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
  The following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans: 

For domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental based the discount rate on the Aon/Hewitt AA-AAA Universe yield curve in 2016 and 2015. The assumed long term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.  
  In 2016, Occidental adopted the Society of Actuaries 2016 Mortality Improvement Scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined benefit retirement plans in the United States use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor s pension obligations. The new mortality improvement scale reflects additional data that the Social Security Administration has released since the 2014 Mortality Tables Report and Mortality Improvement Scale released in 2015. This additional data shows a lower degree of mortality improvement than previously reflected. The changes in the mortality improvement scale results in a     decrease of $5 million and $19 million in the pension and postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. 
  For pension plans outside the United States, Occidental based its discount rate on rates indicative of government or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments when necessary. The discount rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 1.0 percent to 10.8 percent at   December 31, 2016   and  from 1.5 percent to 10 percent at December 31,   2015  . The average rate of increase in future compensation levels ranged from 1.0 percent to 10.0 percent in   2016  , depending on local economic conditions.  
  The postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected at an assumed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 1.97 percent and 1.60 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI. For those union employees, Occidental projected that healthcare cost trend rates would decrease 0.25 percent per year from 6.50 percent in 2016 until they reach 4.50 percent in 2025, and remain at 4.50 percent thereafter. A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed healthcare cost trend rates would result in an increase of $44 million or a reduction of $36 million, respectively, in the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016. The annual service and interest costs would not be materially affected by these changes. 
  The actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.

FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS 
  Occidental employs a total return investment approach that uses a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments to optimize the long-term return of plan assets at a prudent level of risk. The investments are monitored by Occidental s Pension and Retirement Trust and Investment Committee (Investment Committee) in its role as fiduciary. The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes. Equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations. Other asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, may be used with the goals of enhancing long-term returns and improving portfolio diversification. The target allocation of plan assets is 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent debt securities. Investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies. 
    
  The fair values of Occidental s pension plan assets by asset category are as follows: 

(a) 
    This category represents investment grade bonds of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers from diverse industries. 
              (b) 
    This category includes investment funds that primarily invest in U.S. and non-U.S. common stocks and fixed-income securities. 
              (c) 
    This category represents direct investments in common and preferred stocks from diverse U.S. and non-U.S. industries. 
        
  The activity during the years ended   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , for the assets using Level 3 fair value measurements was insignificant. Occidental expects to contribute $3 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans during   2017  . 
  Estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:

    INVESTMENTS AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

EQUITY INVESTMENTS 
  As of   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of equity-method investments, respectively. 
  As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental s equity investments consisted mainly of a 12-percent interest in Plains Pipeline, a   24.5  -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, and various other partnerships and joint ventures. Equity investments paid dividends of $224 million, $438 million, and $396 million to Occidental in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2016  , cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since they were acquired was immaterial. As of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental's investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by approximately $653 million, of which almost $537 million represented goodwill and the remainder comprised intangibles amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
  The following table presents Occidental s interest in the summarized financial information of its equity-method investments: 

Occidental s investment in Dolphin, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests through which Occidental owns (i) a   24.5  -percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under an agreement which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements; and (ii) a   24.5  -percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which operates a pipeline and is accounted for as an equity investment. 
  In November 2014, Occidental sold a portion of its equity interest in Plains Pipeline for approximately $1.7 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion. 
    
  AVAILABLE FOR SALE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESOURCES STOCK 
  As part of Occidental's spin-off of its California oil and gas operations and related assets, Occidental retained 71.5 million shares of, or approximately 18.7 percent interest in, California Resources stock, which was recorded as an available for sale  investment.  Occidental recorded an other-than-temporary loss of $227 million for this available for sale investment as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, Occidental's available for sale investment in California Resources was $167 million.   
  In March 2016, Occidental distributed a special stock dividend for all of its 71.5 million shares of common stock of California Resources to stockholders and recorded a $78 million loss to reduce the investment to its fair market value. Occidental no longer owns any shares of California Resources common stock. 
    
  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  From time to time, Occidental purchases oil, NGLs, power, steam and chemicals from and sells oil, NGLs, natural gas, chemicals and power to certain of its equity investees and other related parties. During   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the following amounts due from or to its related parties: 

(a) 
    In   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , sales of Occidental-produced oil and NGLs to Plains Pipeline accounted for 89 percent, 87 percent and 46 percent of these totals, respectively. Sales to Plains Pipeline related to Occidental's oil and gas production are disclosed above. In addition to these sales, Occidental conducts marketing activities with Plains Pipeline for oil, NGLs and transportation.  Net margins associated with these marketing activities are negligible.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

FAIR VALUES   RECURRING 
  In January 2012, Occidental entered into a long-term contract to purchase CO   2   . This contract contains a price adjustment clause that is linked to changes in NYMEX crude oil prices. Occidental determined that the portion of this contract linked to NYMEX oil prices is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and Occidental therefore bifurcated this embedded pricing feature from its host contract and accounts for it at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.  
  The following tables provide fair value measurement information for assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis:

FAIR VALUES   NONRECURRING 
  During the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, Occidental recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $15 million related to proved oil and gas properties.  
  As a result of the sharp decline of the forward price curve during 2015, as well as the decision to sell or exit non-core operations, Occidental recognized approximately $6.5 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to proved oil and gas properties. Internationally, Occidental recognized $4.7 billion in pre-tax impairment charges related to $1.8 billion in charges in Oman, $1.3 billion in Iraq and Libya, $1 billion in Qatar, and $550 million in Colombia and Bolivia. Domestically, Occidental recognized approximately $763 million pre-tax impairment charges related to the sale of the Williston assets, $460 million pre-tax impairment charges for assets in the Piceance Basin as well as a $554 million pre-tax impairment charges related to proved oil and gas properties in South Texas.  
  The impairment tests, including the fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows. These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based on forward price curves and, where applicable, contractual prices, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8-20 percent. These properties were impacted by persistently worldwide low oil and natural gas prices and changing management's development plans. Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  In the fourth quarter 2015, Occidental recognized approximately $814 million in pre-tax impairment charges for a Midstream CO   2    treatment plant related to recurring CO   2    shortfalls and unpaid penalty fees.  
  In 2015, Occidental recognized approximately $121 million pre-tax charges related to the impairments of Chemical assets.

NOTE 16 
    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 

Occidental conducts its continuing operations through   three   segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas. The chemical segment mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO   2    and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.  
  Results of industry segments and geographic areas exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and income from the segments' equity investments. Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions. 
  Identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments. Corporate assets consist of cash and restricted cash, certain corporate receivables and PP E.

NOTE 17 
    SPIN-OFF OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION 

On November 30, 2014, Occidental's California oil and gas operations and related assets were spun-off through the pro rata distribution of 81.3 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of California Resources, creating an independent, publicly traded company. Occidental shareholders at the close of business on the record date of November 17, 2014 received 0.4 shares of California Resources for every share of Occidental common stock held.  
  In connection with the spin-off, California Resources distributed to Occidental $4.95 billion in restricted cash and $1.15 billion in unrestricted cash. The $4.95 billion distribution was used solely to pay dividends, repurchase shares of Occidental stock and repay debt within eighteen months following the distribution.  
  On March 24, 2016, Occidental distributed all of its remaining 71.5 million shares of common stock of California Resources to stockholders of record as of February 29, 2016 as a special stock dividend.  
  Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations related to California Resources were as follows:

Supplemental Oil and Gas Information     (Unaudited) 
    
  The following tables set forth Occidental s net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of oil (including condensate), NGLs and natural gas and changes in such quantities. Proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. For the 2016, 2015 and 2014 disclosures, the calculated average West Texas Intermediate oil prices were $42.75, $50.28 and $94.99 per barrel, respectively. The calculated average Henry Hub natural gas prices for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $2.55, $2.66 and $4.42 per MMBtu, respectively. Reserves are stated net of applicable royalties. Estimated reserves include Occidental's economic interests under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other similar economic arrangements. In addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.  
  Prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely. Historically, the markets for crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prolonged or further declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices would continue to reduce Occidental's operating results and cash flows, and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.  

79 

(a) 
    A majority of the proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements. 
              (b) 
    Sales of proved reserves in 2016 were related to the sale of Libya. Sales of proved reserves in 2015 were related to the sale of Williston and exit from Iraq. Sales of proved reserves in 2014 were related to the sale of Hugoton. 
              (c) 
    Revisions of previous estimates were primarily price and price-related. 
              (d) 
    Approximately 9 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016 are nonproducing, primarily associated with Permian EOR. 
              (e) 
    A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.  

80 

(a) 
    Sales of proved reserves in 2014 were related to the sale of Hugoton. 
              (b) 
    Revisions of previous estimates were primarily price and price-related. 
              (c) 
    Approximately 5 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016 are nonproducing, primarily associated with Permian EOR. 
              (d) 
    A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.  

81 

(a) 
    Over half of proved reserve amounts relate to PSCs and other similar economic arrangements. 
              (b) 
    2016 sales of proved reserves are related to Piceance. Sales of proved reserves in 2015 were related to the sale of Williston. Sales of proved reserves in 2014 were related to the sale of Hugoton. 
              (c) 
    Revisions of previous estimates were primarily price and price-related. 
              (d) 
    Approximately 3 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016 are nonproducing, primarily associated with the Permian. 
              (e) 
    A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with  Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.  

82 

(a) 
    Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in 2016, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were   $43.32   per barrel and   $2.42   per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1. 
               (c) 
    2016 sales of proved reserves are related to Libya and Piceance. Sales of proved reserves in 2015 were related to the sale of Williston and exit from Iraq. Sales of proved reserves in 2014 were related to the sale of Hugoton. 
              (d) 
    Revisions are primarily positive technical revisions in Al Hosn Gas and price revisions in Oman due to the PSC impact, partially offset by negative domestic price revisions. 
              (e) 
    Approximately 7 percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016 are nonproducing, primarily associated with Permian EOR. 
              (f) 
    A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with  Al Hosn Gas are expected to be developed beyond five years and is tied to an approved long term development project.

CAPITALIZED COSTS 
  Capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated DD A were as follows: 

(a) 
    Includes acquisition costs, development costs, capitalized interest and asset retirement obligations. 
       
  COSTS INCURRED 
  Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether capitalized or expensed, were as follows: 

84 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Occidental s oil and gas producing activities for continuing operations, which exclude items such as asset dispositions, corporate overhead, interest and royalties, were as follows: 

(a) 
    Revenues are net of royalty payments.  
              (b) 
    Production costs are the costs incurred in lifting the oil and gas to the surface and include gathering, primary processing and field storage, but do not include DD A, royalties, income taxes, interest, general and administrative and other expenses. 
              (c) 
    United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead. 

85 

RESULTS PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS 

(a) 
    Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in 2016, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were   $43.32   per barrel and   $2.42   per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1. 
              (b) 
    Revenues are net of royalty payments. 
              (c) 
    United States federal income taxes reflect certain expenses related to oil and gas activities allocated for United States income tax purposes only, including allocated interest and corporate overhead. 

86 

STANDARDIZED MEASURE, INCLUDING YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES THEREIN, OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS 
  For purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to Occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended December 31,   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions. The realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions. Future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce proved reserves at year end. Future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows. The discount was computed by application of a 10 percent discount factor. The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions at December 31,   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  . Such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past. Other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results. 

(a) 
    Includes asset retirement costs.

              (b) 
    Total acres in which interests are held. 
              (c) 
    Sum of the fractional interests owned based on working interests, or interests under PSCs and other economic arrangements. 
              (d) 
    Acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves. 
       
  Occidental s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, Occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. Scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Occidental.

Oil, NGLs and Natural Gas Production and Sales Volumes Per Day 
  The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2016  . The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers.

92 

93 

(a) 
    Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.  Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in 2016, the average prices of WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas were $43.32 per barrel and $2.42, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.

ITEM 9A 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
      
  MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Occidental s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Management has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of   December 31, 2016  , based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of   December 31, 2016  , Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
  Occidental s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on Occidental s internal control over financial reporting. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Occidental's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   December 31, 2016  . 
  There has been no change in Occidental's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Occidental's internal control over financial reporting. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is set forth in Item 8.

Article 1.   Introduction 
   
  1.1         Restatement of Plan 
  Effective as of January 1, 2016, Occidental Petroleum Corporation ( Company ) hereby amends and restates the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Savings Plan ( Plan ) to make amendments and changes as reflected herein. The provisions of this restatement shall be effective as of January 1, 2016, except as follows or as otherwise specifically provided in this document: (a) effective January 1, 2017, a Participant must make separate deferral elections for Base Pay and Bonus; (b) effective January 1, 2017, the Plan will permit Roth Contributions and In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions and will accept rollovers from Roth sources; and (c) effective January 1, 2017, Roth sources will be additional and independent sources for purposes of distributions and withdrawals hereunder. Where a particular provision of this restatement has an effective date earlier than January 1, 2016, the relevant provision of this restatement shall supersede the corresponding provision of the prior version of the Plan as of the earlier effective date. Where a particular provision of this restatement has an effective date later than January 1, 2016, the relevant provision of the prior version of the Plan shall continue to apply prior to such effective date. 
   
  1.2         Purpose and Applicability of the Plan 
  This Plan is intended to encourage and assist Eligible Employees in adopting a regular program of savings to provide additional security for their retirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Plan restatement are applicable only to Eligible Employees on or after January 1, 2016. Unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan restatement, the Plan provisions in effect prior to this restatement shall continue to govern the terms and conditions of the Plan prior to January 1, 2016. 
  Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, if any modification of ERISA or the Code (or regulations or rulings thereunder) requires that a conforming Plan amendment be adopted as of a stated effective date in order for the Plan to continue to be a qualified plan, this Plan shall be operated in accordance with such requirements until the date when a conforming Plan amendment is adopted. 
   
  1.3         Structure of the Plan 
  The Plan is intended to qualify as a stock bonus plan under Code section 401(a) that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Code section 401(k)(2).  
  Effective June 1, 2002, to enable the deduction on dividends paid on certain employer securities as permitted by Code section 404(k), the Matching Accounts, or portions thereof, invested in the Oxy Stock Fund under the Plan, at any point in time and in the aggregate, are intended to qualify, and are hereby designated, as an employee stock ownership plan ( ESOP ), within the meaning of Code section 4975(e)(7). Effective July 19, 2007, to expand the availability of the deduction on dividends paid on employer securities as permitted by Code section 404(k), the ESOP is expanded to include the Oxy Stock Fund and the portions of Matching Accounts not invested in the Oxy Stock Fund shall cease to constitute part of the ESOP. On or before July 18, 2007, the Matching Accounts, or portions thereof, invested in the Oxy Stock Fund under the Plan, at any point in time, taken together, and effective on or after July 19, 2007, all assets invested in the Oxy Stock Fund at any point in time, regardless of funding source, constitute an  eligible individual account plan,  as defined in ERISA section 407(d)(3), which explicitly provides for the acquisition and holding of and investment primarily in shares of Oxy Stock which constitute  qualifying employer securities,  as described in Code section 4975(e)(8), and  employer securities,  as defined in Code section 409(l). 
  The Company intends that the Plan and the ESOP together shall constitute a single plan under ERISA and the Code. Accordingly, the provisions set forth in the other sections of the Plan shall apply to the ESOP in the same manner as those provisions apply to the remaining portions of the Plan, except to the extent that those provisions are by their terms inapplicable to the ESOP, or to the extent that they are inconsistent with the specific provisions set forth herein. Except as set forth in specific provisions herein that are related to the ESOP, including but not limited to Plan section 9.5, the designation of any portion of the Plan constituting part of the ESOP shall not affect any Beneficiary designations or any other applicable agreements, elections or consents that Participants, Spouses, Alternate Payees or Beneficiaries validly executed under the terms of the Plan before June 1, 2002, the effective date of the ESOP; and such designations, agreements, elections, and consents shall apply under the ESOP in the same manner as they apply under the Plan. 
   
  Article 2.         Definitions and Construction 
   
  2.1         Definitions 
  Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below, unless otherwise expressly provided; and when the defined meaning is intended, the term is capitalized.

If Pretax Deferrals or Roth Contributions cannot be taken into account under the ADP Test because they do not meet the following rules, then such amount must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Code section 401(a)(4) for the Plan Year for which they are made. The following rules shall apply in determining the Average Deferral Percentages: 
              (1)

If the Administrative Committee makes this election for a Plan Year, then the Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions shall be taken into account only in the ADP Test (or the ACP Test) for that Plan Year and shall not be taken into account in the ADP Test (or the ACP Test) for any other Plan Year. 
              (2) 
    If any Highly Compensated Employee is a participant under two or more qualified cash or deferred arrangements of the Company or any Affiliate (including this Plan), all such cash or deferred arrangements shall be treated as one such arrangement for purposes of determining the Actual Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee, except as provided in Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(a)(3)(ii).

     For purposes of paragraph (1), the determination of control shall be made without reference to paragraphs (a)(4) and (e)(3)(C) of Code section 1563. For the purposes of applying the limitations of Plan sections 2.1(nnn) and 6.6, the phrase  more than 50 percent  shall be substituted for the phrase  at least 80 percent  each place it appears in Code section 1563(a)(1).

Such ratios and Average Contribution Percentage for each group shall be calculated to the nearest one hundredth of 1 percent of an Eligible Employee s Testing Compensation.

    Any Matching Contributions that are forfeited because the Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions or After Tax Contributions to which they relate are determined to be an Excess Deferral, an Excess Contribution, or an Excess Aggregate Contribution for the Plan Year are not taken into account in determining a Participant s Average Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year. 
              (5) 
    If any Highly Compensated Employee is a participant under two or more Qualified Plans of the Company or any Affiliate (including this Plan) that provide for matching contributions or after tax contributions, all such contributions made by or on behalf of the Highly Compensated Employee under such Qualified Plans during the 12 month period that coincides with the Plan Year shall be taken into account in determining the Average Contribution Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee, except as provided in Treasury Regulations section 1.401(m) 2(a)(3)(ii).

    During the Plan Year, the individual performs any services for the Company or any Affiliate, other than as an Employee, and the requirements of Code section 414(n)(2)(A) (relating to performing services pursuant to an agreement with the Company or any Affiliate) and Code section 414(n)(2)(C) (relating to performing services under the primary direction or control of the Company or any Affiliate) are satisfied. 
              (ii)

    Credit shall be given to an Employee for the period of time beginning on the first day of the month in which the individual first becomes an Employee and ending on the last day of the month in which occurs the Employee s Separation from Service.

    Credit shall be given to an Employee for each period beginning upon the date the individual has a Separation from Service and ending upon the first day of the month in which the individual first becomes an Employee thereafter but only if the Employee is reemployed within 12 months of the date of such Separation from Service.

    Credit shall be given to an Employee after a Separation from Service for any period beginning on the first day of the month in which the Employee first becomes an Employee after rehire and ending on the last day of the month the Employee has a Separation from Service thereafter.

    Whenever the total number of years of Service of an Employee must be ascertained under this Plan, all noncontinuous periods of Service which are credited to such Employee shall be aggregated, regardless of the length or any period of Service and regardless of the length of any period between a Separation from Service and rehire.

    With respect to any frozen contributions under this Plan or any Qualified Plan that is merged into this Plan, if such contributions resume under this Plan or any Qualified Plan into which this Plan is merged, then for purposes of determining the Participant s nonforfeitable right to such contributions, a Participant shall receive credit for Service incurred both prior to and subsequent to the date such contributions were frozen. 
              (d) 
    Vesting and Benefit Payments  . Being vested does not mean that a Participant is entitled to immediate distribution benefits. Benefits under the Plan shall be paid only in accordance with Article 7.

    The Participant elects, in accordance with Plan section 7.3, to commence or receive a distribution of the value of the Participant s vested Account on account of a Separation from Service. For this purpose, if the percentage vested in the table under Plan section 3.5(b)) is zero, the Participant will be deemed to have elected such a distribution and the nonvested portion of the Account will be immediately forfeited. 
              (b) 
    The Participant incurs five consecutive breaks in service. For this purpose, a break in service is a period of 12 months in which the Participant is absent from Service, except that if the absence is due to a maternity or paternity reason described in Plan section 2.1(lll)(3), the period between the first and second anniversaries of such absence shall be neither a period of Service nor a period of severance. 
     If the Participant who has forfeited his nonvested Account resumes employment as an Eligible Employee, then the cash value (determined at the time of forfeiture) of the amount forfeited shall be restored to the Participant s Account. No buyback shall be required and the reinstatement will occur regardless of the length of the Participant s absence from Service. 
   
  Article 4.         Active Participant Contributions 
   
  4.1         Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions and After Tax Contributions 
           (a) 
    Covered Employees will be automatically enrolled in the Plan as described in Plan section 4.6 below. 
              (b) 
    Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, each Active Participant may elect to contribute as After Tax Contributions or to have the Employer contribute on the Participant s behalf as Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions an amount of the Participant s Base Pay which together is from 1 percent to the contribution percentage limit specified for the Active Participant in Appendix E for the Plan Year. The Administrative Committee may adjust the contribution percentage limit specified in Appendix E at the beginning of each Plan Year without the need of a formal Plan amendment, provided that any such limitations shall be communicated to eligible Participants in advance of the pay periods to which such limitations will apply. The percentage elected of Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions and/or After Tax Contributions may be in increments of a tenth of a percent.   
     The Participant s elected Pretax Deferral, Roth Contribution and After-Tax Contribution percentages shall apply, but not in excess of an aggregate of 5 percent, to the Active Participant s Annual Bonus. The Annual Bonus shall be counted for this purpose in the Plan Year it is paid even if it is received for services performed in a prior Plan Year.  Effective January 1, 2017, unless the Participant affirmatively elects otherwise, with respect to any Participant hired prior to August 5, 2016, the election in effect as of August 5, 2016 will apply to any Annual Bonus paid in the 2017 Plan Year and any subsequent plan year until the Participant affirmatively elects otherwise.  Effective August 8, 2016, any Participant subject to automatic enrollment pursuant to Section 4.6, must make a separate election to make Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions and After-Tax Contributions from Participant s Annual Bonus. 
           (c) 
    Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no Participant shall be permitted to have elective deferrals made under this Plan, or any other Qualified Plan maintained by the Company or Affiliates during any taxable year, in excess of the dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g)(1) in effect for such taxable year, except to the extent permitted under Code section 414(v). 
              (d) 
    No benefits other than Matching Contributions shall be conditioned on a Participant s election to make After Tax Contributions or have Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions made on the Participant s behalf under this Plan. Any portion of a contribution that is not designated as a Pretax Deferral, Roth Contribution or Catch Up Contribution shall be designated as an After Tax Contribution. 
              (e) 
    The Participant s election made under this section shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this Article and such other rules of nondiscriminatory application as the Administrative Committee may prescribe for the proper administration of the Plan. 
      
  4.2         Catch Up Contributions 
  Each Active Participant who will have attained age 50 before the close of the Plan Year shall be eligible to make Catch Up Contributions in accordance with and subject to the limitations of Code section 414(v) for pay periods ending after July 1, 2002.  Each Participant must elect whether such Catch-Up Contributions will be in the form of Pretax Deferrals or Roth Contributions. 
           (a) 
    Catch Up Contributions shall not be taken into account for purposes of the provisions of Plan sections 6.1 and 6.6, implementing the required limitations of Code sections 402(g) and 415, respectively.  
               (c) 
    Elections to make Catch Up Contributions shall be made separately from the Active Participant s election of Pretax Deferrals or Roth Contributions under Plan section 4.1, shall not be subject to the contribution percentage limit on Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions specified in Plan section 4.1, and shall be made in accordance with uniform procedures established by the Administrative Committee. Such election procedures will require the eligible Active Participant to elect Catch Up Contributions as a fixed dollar amount per pay period. 
              (d) 
    Under no circumstances will Catch Up Contributions elected under this Plan section entitle the Participant to Matching Contribution, even if it is later determined that the contribution is not a Catch Up Contribution because it is less than an applicable limit. 
              (e) 
    For purposes of recordkeeping and communications with Participants, Catch Up Contributions, Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions may be aggregated and reported as held in the Participant s Pretax Account or Roth Account, as applicable, without changing the character of any Catch Up Contributions as such for purposes of Code section 414(v). 
      
  4.3         Election Procedures 
           (a) 
    Each Active Participant shall be permitted to make the elections described in Plan section 4.1 and, if eligible, Plan section 4.2 in the manner prescribed by the Administrative Committee. If a Participant has elected to begin, stop, increase, or decrease Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions or, if eligible, Catch Up Contributions, the Active Participant may file a new election in the manner prescribed by the Administrative Committee to change Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions or, if eligible, Catch Up Contributions at any time and such election shall become effective on the first pay period following the date on which the election is properly received. The election shall remain in effect until changed by the Active Participant or until he or she ceases to be an Active Participant or goes on an unpaid leave of absence. 
              (b) 
    If an Active Participant becomes an Inactive Participant or Former Participant, or goes on unpaid leave of absence, any Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Catch Up Contributions for the Participant shall cease. If the individual again becomes an Active Participant or returns from an unpaid leave of absence, he or she may make a new election under this section. 
              (c) 
    All elections shall apply to Earnings paid in the first available payroll period following the date the election is processed and shall be irrevocable for such period. In addition, except for occasional, bona fide administrative considerations, Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions and Catch Up Contributions made pursuant to such elections cannot precede the earlier of the performance of services relating to the Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions or Catch Up Contributions and the date when the Earnings subject to the election would be currently available to the Participant in the absence of an election to defer. 
      
  4.4         Salary Reduction 
  Each Active Participant who makes a Pretax Deferral or Roth Contribution election described in Plan section 4.1 or, if eligible, a Catch Up Contribution election described in Plan section 4.2 shall, by the act of making such election or elections, have his or her Earnings reduced by an equivalent amount for so long as the election remains in effect. 
   
  4.5         Deposit and Crediting of Deferrals and Contributions 
  Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions, and Catch Up Contributions shall be transferred to the Trust Fund as soon as reasonably practicable after the payroll payment date at which a corresponding amount would have been paid to the Participant in the absence of the election of such contributions. Pretax Deferrals shall be allocated to the Participant s Pretax Account; Roth Contributions shall be allocated to the Participant s Roth Account; Catch Up Contributions shall be allocated to the Participant s Pretax Account and/or Roth Account, as applicable, and After Tax Contributions shall be allocated to the Participant s After Tax Contribution Account as of the payroll payment date on which the corresponding amount would have been paid in absence of the elections under Plan section 4.1 and, if applicable, Plan section 4.2, but shall share in any investment gains and losses only after they are received by the Trust Fund. 
   
  4.6         Eligible Automatic Enrollment Arrangement 
           (a) 
    Effective Date  .  For Covered Employees hired on or after August 5, 2016, the following automatic enrollment procedures will apply. 
              (b) 
    Default Percentage  .  A Covered Employee will have a reasonable opportunity after receipt of the automatic enrollment notice to make an alternate election.  If a Covered Employee fails to make an alternate election, Pretax Deferrals will automatically begin being made on such Covered Employee s behalf, in an amount equal to 5% of his or her Base Pay (  i.e.  , the    Default Percentage   ) on the Covered Employee s date of hire.     
              (c) 
    Alternate Election  .  In the event a Covered Employee does not desire to have Pretax Deferrals made on his or her behalf at the Default Percentage, the Covered Employee may elect a different amount up to the contribution percentage limit specified for the Active Participant in Appendix E for the Plan Year or elect to not participate in the Plan.  Any alternate election is to be made in accordance with the election procedures set forth in Section 4.3 above. 
              (d) 
    Withdrawal  .  No later than 30 days after default Pretax Deferrals are first withheld from a Covered Employee s Base Pay, the Covered Employee may request a distribution of his or her default Pretax Deferrals.  The amount to be distributed from the Plan upon the Covered Employee s request is equal to the amount of default Pretax Deferrals made through the earlier of (a) the pay date for the second payroll period that begins after the Covered Employee s withdrawal request and (b) the first pay date that occurs 30 days after the Eligible Employee s request, plus attributable earnings through the date of distribution.  Unless the Covered Employee affirmatively elects otherwise, any withdrawal request will be treated as an affirmative election to cease default Pretax Deferrals made on the Covered Employee s behalf.  Default Pretax Deferrals distributed pursuant to this Section 4.6(d) are not counted towards the Code Section 402(g) limit. Matching Contributions that might otherwise be allocated to a Covered Employee s Account on behalf of default Pretax Deferrals will not be allocated to the extent the Covered Employee withdraws such default Pretax Deferrals pursuant to this Section 4.6(d) and any Matching Contributions already made on account of such default Pretax Deferrals that are later withdrawn pursuant to this Section 4.6(d) will be forfeited and subject to allocation as a forfeiture. 

Article 5.         Employer Contributions 
   
  5.1         Employees Eligible for Matching Contributions 
  Subject to the other provisions of this Plan, the Employer shall contribute Matching Contributions to this Plan only for a Participant who was an Active Participant during the pay period for which the corresponding Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions (including amounts recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions) or After Tax Contributions were made. Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, any Matching Contribution (including any investment gain attributable thereto), which relates to an Excess Deferral under Plan section 6.1, Excess Contribution under Plan section 6.3 (unless recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions) or Excess Aggregate Contribution under Plan section 6.5 shall be forfeited and shall not be treated as a Matching Contribution with respect to the Participant for the Plan Year.  
   
  5.2         Amount of Matching Contributions 
  Matching Contributions shall be made on behalf of an Active Participant for each payroll period for which Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions or After-Tax Contributions were made with respect to the Participant for the Plan Year. Matching Contributions may also be made on behalf of eligible Participants, as the Employer or Administrative Committee deems necessary or appropriate for administrative purposes, at such other times, but not later than 12 months after the end of the Plan Year. The amount of Matching Contributions allocated to the Participant s Matching Contributions Account shall be equal to the matching percent shown in the table in   Appendix F  , based on the employment classification of the Participant on the last day of the payroll period, multiplied by the Pretax Deferrals (including an Adjustment Contribution), Roth Contribution (including an Adjustment Contribution) or After-Tax Contribution made with respect to the Participant on the Participant s first 5 percent of Base Pay and Annual Bonus for the pay period. With respect to United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local 12773 represented employees, the amount of Matching Contributions allocated to the Participant s Matching Contributions Account shall be equal to the matching percent shown in the table in   Appendix F  , based on the employment classification of the Participant on the last day of the payroll period, multiplied by the Pretax Deferrals (including an Adjustment Contribution), Roth Contributions (including an Adjustment Contribution) or After-Tax Contribution made with respect to the Participant on the Participant s first 4 percent of Base Pay and Annual Bonus for the pay period. Effective February 29, 2016, the Matching Contributions allocated with respect to United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local 12773 represented employees will be the same as for other Active Participants.  Effective January 1, 2016, the Matching Contributions allocated with respect to United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, Local 2154-03 represented employees will be the same as for other Active Participants. The Administrative Committee may limit the amount of Matching Contributions made on behalf of a Participant to the extent that the Administrative Committee determines necessary to comply with the limits of   Article 6  . 
   
  5.3         Depositing and Crediting Matching Contributions 
  The Company shall make such contributions to the Trust Fund as are required by this Plan, subject to the right of the Company to discontinue the Plan. The Company shall contribute an amount which, when added to forfeitures under Plan section 11.3, is sufficient to provide the Matching Contribution allocations required by Plan section 5.2. 
  Matching Contributions shall be transferred to the Trust Fund as soon as reasonably practicable after the payroll payment date at which the corresponding Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions or After Tax Contributions would have been paid to the Participant in the absence of the election of such contributions. Matching Contributions shall be allocated to the Participant s Matching Account as of the payroll payment date on which the corresponding amount would have been paid in absence of the Participant s election, but shall share in any investment gains and losses only after they are received by the Trust Fund. 
   
  Article 6.         Benefit Limitations 
   
  6.1         Elective Deferral Limit 
           (a) 
    Dollar Limit  . For any calendar year, the sum of the following items shall not exceed the elective deferral dollar limit of Code section 402(g)(1), as adjusted pursuant to Code section 402(g)(4): 
              (1) 
    All Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions (but not Catch Up Contributions) made on behalf of an Active Participant for that calendar year; and 
              (2) 
    Any other pretax or Roth contributions made for the calendar year to any Qualified Plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate which are elective deferrals as defined in Code section 402(g)(3), but not including any such elective deferrals that are catch up contributions under Code section 414(v). 
     Any amount deferred in excess of the dollar limit stated in this subsection is referred to as an Excess Deferral. 
           (b) 
    Calendar Year as Participant s Taxable Year  . A Pretax Deferral and Roth Contribution made on behalf of an Active Participant shall be treated as made for a calendar year, for purposes of Plan section 6.1(a)(1) if it is made on account of the Active Participant s election to reduce Compensation that would otherwise be payable within that calendar year. 
              (c) 
    Preventing Excess Deferrals  . If before the end of a calendar year, the Administrative Committee determines (or the Active Participant notifies his or her Employer that he or she has determined) that Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions to be made on behalf of an Active Participant for that calendar year would exceed the limits of this section or Code section 402(g), then the Administrative Committee shall take one or both of the following steps, to the extent necessary, to avoid exceeding the limits of this section or Code section 402(g): 
              (1) 
    Permit an Active Participant to submit a revised election under Plan section 4.1; or 
              (2) 
    Reduce Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions that otherwise would be made, pursuant to the Participant s current election, for the rest of the calendar year (and adjust the corresponding reductions in Earnings) so that the limits are not exceeded. 
              (d) 
    Correcting Excess Deferrals  . If Excess Deferrals have been made on the Participant s behalf in excess of the limits of Code section 402(g), then the Excess Deferrals shall be corrected as follows: 
              (1) 
    The Participant must notify the Administrative Committee, by such other means as the Administrative Committee shall prescribe, no later than March 1, immediately following the close of a calendar year, stating that the sum of the items described in subsection 6.1(a) are in excess of the limits of Code section 402(g). The notice provided by the Participant shall state the portion of such excess amount that has been allocated to this Plan as an Excess Deferral. The amount of the Excess Deferral allocated to this Plan shall not exceed the total amount of the Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions (excluding Catch Up Contributions) made on behalf of the Participant for that calendar year. The Administrative Committee may require the Participant to certify to the amount of the Excess Deferral and to provide substantiating evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Committee. 
              (2) 
    If the Active Participant does not provide the notice described in paragraph (1) by the following March 1, but it is determined that Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions (excluding Catch Up Contributions) made on behalf of an Active Participant for a calendar year inadvertently exceed the limits of subsection (a), then the Excess Deferral for the calendar year shall be distributed in accordance with this subsection. 
              (3) 
    The Administrative Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute, by April 15 following the close of the calendar year, the Excess Deferral for that calendar year allocated (or deemed allocated) to the Plan by the Participant.  Any Excess Deferrals shall be treated as consisting first of any Pretax Deferrals made by the Participant for such Plan Year, as applicable, and second any Roth Contributions which the Participant made for the Plan Year, as applicable, except as otherwise elected by the Participant.  The distributed Excess Deferral shall be withdrawn from the Investment Funds in which the Pretax Account and/or Roth Account, as applicable, is then invested on a pro rata basis. The Trustee shall also distribute the net income attributable to the Excess Deferrals, as determined by the Administrative Committee in accordance with one of the methods permitted under Treasury Regulations section 1.402(g) 1(e)(5) disregarding, effective January 1, 2007, any provision of prior regulations relating to the distribution of gap period earnings. Corrective distributions under this subsection shall be coordinated with distributions of Excess Contributions under Plan section 6.3 in accordance with Treasury Regulations sections 1.401(k) 1(f)(5) and 1.402(g) 1(e)(6). Any Matching Contributions that have been made with respect to Excess Deferrals that are distributed to a Highly Compensated Employee, in accordance with this subsection, shall be forfeited, as soon as is practicable after corrective distributions are made. Such Matching Contributions shall be forfeited, whether or not the Participant would otherwise have a vested interest in those Matching Contributions, pursuant to Plan section 3.5. 
      
  6.2         Discrimination Limits on Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions 
  As of the last day of each Plan Year, the Administrative Committee shall require testing of Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions made for the Plan Year to assure that the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) for the Plan Year of Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP Test limits specified in this Plan section. 
           (a) 
    Aggregation, Disaggregation and Restructuring  . The rules of this section shall be administered so as to comply with the mandatory disaggregation requirements of Treasury Regulations section 1.410(b) 7(c) and, if the Administrative Committee chooses, the permissive aggregation rules of Treasury Regulations section 1.410(b) 7(d), provided that any aggregated plans shall use the same testing method under Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(a)(2)(ii) (  i.e.  , current year or prior year testing method) as is used by the Plan for the Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2004, the mandatory disaggregation rules relating to the ESOP and non ESOP portions of the Plan shall not apply. 
              (1) 
    To the extent required by the mandatory disaggregation rules, Represented Employees and Nonrepresented Employees shall be treated as comprising separate plans for purposes of applying the ADP Test. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee may treat two or more separate collective bargaining units as a single collective bargaining unit for purposes of applying the ADP Test, provided that the combinations of units are determined on a basis that is reasonable and reasonably consistent from Plan Year to Plan Year. 
              (2) 
    If, after application of the mandatory disaggregation rules, this Plan is permissively aggregated with one or more other plans that include qualified cash or deferred arrangements for purposes of Code section 401(a)(4) or 410(b), then the cash or deferred arrangements of this Plan and such other plans shall be treated as one arrangement for purposes of this Plan section. 
              (3) 
    In determining whether the restrictions of this Plan section are met, the Administrative Committee may exclude from the ADP Test all Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees and who have not met the minimum age and service requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A), if the Administrative Committee elects to apply Code section 410(b)(4)(B). Alternatively, the Administrative Committee may apply the ADP Test separately to all Eligible Employees who have not met the minimum age and service requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A). 
              (b) 
    ADP Test  . The Actual Deferral Percentage for the Plan Year of Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees shall not exceed the greater of: 
              (1) 
    The product of 1.25 and the Actual Deferral Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year; or 
              (2) 
    The lesser of: 
              (A) 
    The product of two and the Actual Deferral Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year, or 
              (B) 
    The Actual Deferral Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year plus two percentage points. 
     By an amendment to the Plan, the Administrative Committee may elect to apply paragraphs (1) and (2) by using the Actual Deferral Percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year only if the current year testing method has been used for at least the last five Plan Years. If the Plan is aggregated with any other Qualified Plan, the Actual Deferral Percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year may be used only if the Plan is amended to so provide and each Qualified Plan that is aggregated with this Plan used the current year method for at least the last five years (or, if shorter, the period that such other Qualified Plan was in existence, including years in which the Qualified Plan was a portion of another Qualified Plan). 
           (c) 
    The restrictions of this section shall be based on the Participant s actual Testing Compensation while an Active Participant and total Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions allocated to the Participant s Account for the Plan Year. The Administrative Committee is authorized to restrict the Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions of Highly Compensated Employees in a uniform manner if it determines, based on advance testing done during the Plan Year, that such restriction is necessary or appropriate to assure final Plan Year compliance with restrictions of this section. 
      
  6.3         Corrective Measures if ADP Test Failed 
  If, at the end of the Plan Year, the Administrative Committee determines that the Actual Deferral Percentage of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the maximum permitted for the Plan Year under the ADP Test, then the Administrative Committee shall take the corrective steps described in this Plan section so that the requirements of Plan section 6.2 are met for the Plan Year. Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions, along with any other elective deferrals made to other qualified cash or deferred arrangements that are included in the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, exceeding the ADP Test limits are referred to as Excess Contributions. 
           (a) 
    Correction Methods  . To the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(b)(3) and this Plan section, the Administrative Committee shall first recharacterize Excess Contributions, along with allocable investment gains and losses, as Adjustment Contributions. To the extent Excess Contributions remain for the Plan Year, the Administrative Committee shall next distribute the Excess Contributions, along with allocable investment gains and losses, pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(b)(2) and this Plan section. Regardless of whether recharacterized or distributed, all corrections of Excess Contributions shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(b)(4) and this Plan section. 
              (b) 
    Determining Total Excess Contributions  .     The amount of Excess Contributions attributable to each Highly Compensated Employees is the amount by which Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions, along with any other elective deferrals made to other qualified cash or deferred arrangements that are included in the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, must be reduced so that the Actual Deferral Percentage for that Highly Compensated Employee is reduced to the maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees. The maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees is determined by reducing the Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage for the Plan Year to the Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest Actual Deferral Percentage. If a lesser reduction would enable the ADP Test to be satisfied, only the lesser reduction is used to determine the maximum permissible Actual Deferral Percentage. This procedure is repeated until the ADP Test would be satisfied. The total amount of Excess Contributions to be corrected is equal to the sum of the dollar amounts computed under this subsection for each Highly Compensated Employee and is to be referred to as the Total Excess Contributions. 
              (c) 
    Apportionment of Total Excess Contributions  . Total Excess Contributions for the Plan Year shall be apportioned among Highly Compensated Employees as provided in this subsection. 
              (1) 
    Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions allocated to the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest dollar amount of Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions taken into account under the ADP Test for the Plan Year, including any other elective deferrals made to other qualified cash or deferred arrangements that are included in the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, shall be reduced by the amount required to cause that Highly Compensated Employee s remaining amount of Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions for the Plan Year to be equal to the dollar amount of Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions for the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest dollar amount. This amount shall be allocated as the Excess Contribution for the Highly Compensated Employee, unless a smaller reduction, when added to the total dollar amount already allocated as Excess Contributions for other Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to this procedure equals the Total Excess Contributions for the Plan Year.  Excess Contributions shall be treated as consisting first of any Pretax Deferrals made by the Participant for such Plan Year, as applicable, and second any Roth Contributions which the Participant made for the Plan Year, as applicable, except as otherwise elected by the Participant.    
              (2) 
    If a Highly Compensated Employee s Excess Contributions include elective deferrals made to other qualified cash or deferred arrangements that are included in the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, then the Excess Contribution of that to the Highly Compensated Employee shall not exceed the Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions made under this Plan for the Plan Year. Any portion of the Total Excess Contributions which is apportioned to a Highly Compensated Employee pursuant to this subsection, but which cannot be corrected because of the preceding sentence, shall be apportioned to the Highly Compensated Employee with the next lowest total dollar amount of Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions and that Highly Compensated Employee s Excess Contributions shall be reduced by an amount which includes the amount not corrected for the other Highly Compensated Employee. 
              (3) 
    If the total amount corrected under this subsection is less than the Total Excess Contributions for the Plan Year, the procedure in this paragraph shall be repeated until the total amount corrected is equal to the Total Excess Contributions for the Plan Year. 
              (4) 
    The investment gains and losses allocable to the Excess Contributions are equal to the sum of allocable investment gains and losses for the Plan Year and allocable gains and losses after the Plan Year for which the distribution is made. The allocable investment gain or loss attributable to the Excess Contributions may be determined in accordance with any of the methods permitted under Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(b)(2)(iv), disregarding any provisions relating to the distribution of gap period earnings, and may be determined up to seven days before the date of the correction. 
              (5) 
    Excess Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with respect to which Matching Contributions were not made shall be corrected to the extent necessary under this Plan section before Excess Contributions of that Highly Compensated Employee with respect to which Matching Contributions were made. 
              (6) 
    The requirements of this Plan section shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the total dollar amount corrected equals the Total Excess Contributions with allocable investment gains and losses, even if: 
              (A) 
    The ADP Test would not satisfy the requirements of Plan section 6.2, if the test were rerun including in the test only Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions that were not corrected under this subsection; or 
              (B) 
    The amount corrected with respect to each Highly Compensated Employee is different from the amount computed for purposes of calculating the Total Excess Contributions amount. 
              (d) 
    Rules Applicable to Adjustment Contributions  . Excess Contributions shall not be treated as corrected even if recharacterized under this subsection (d), unless the requirements of this subsection are met. 
              (1) 
    Excess Contributions that are recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and the Highly Compensated Employee as included in gross income of the Highly Compensated Employees to the same extent they would have been included in gross income if distributed. 
              (2) 
    Excess Contributions must be recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions no later than 2  months after the close of the Plan Year. For this purpose, recharacterization will be deemed to have occurred on the date on which the last Highly Compensated Employee is notified that his or her Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions are being recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions. 
              (3) 
    Excess Contributions may be recharacterized as Adjustment Contributions for a Plan Year only if the Plan allows After Tax Contributions for that Plan Year and such Adjustment Contributions are included in the ACP Test for the Plan Year. 
              (4) 
    Investment gains and losses allocable to Excess Contributions shall be allocated to the corresponding Adjustment Contributions after recharacterization. 
              (e) 
    Rules Applicable to Distributions  . Excess Contributions shall not be treated as corrected even if distributed under this subsection (e), unless the requirements of this subsection are met. 
              (1) 
    Excess Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses must be distributed to the Highly Compensated Employee to whom it has been allocated within 12 months after the close of the Plan Year for which the Excess Contribution arose.  
              (2) 
    The distributed Excess Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses shall be taken from the Investment Funds in which the Pretax Account and/or Roth Account is then invested on a pro rata basis. 
              (3) 
    Any Matching Contributions that have been made with respect to Excess Contributions that are distributed to a Highly Compensated Employee shall be forfeited, as soon as is practicable after corrective distributions are made. Such Matching Contributions shall be forfeited, whether or not the Participant would otherwise have a vested interest in those Matching Contributions, pursuant to Plan section 3.5. 
              (4) 
    If the Highly Compensated Employee received a full distribution of his or her Account before Excess Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses are distributed to the Highly Compensated Employee, then the prior distribution shall be reported for taxation purposes as first a correction of Excess Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses to the extent required under this Plan section. 
              (5) 
    A distribution of Excess Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses shall in no event be treated as satisfying a required minimum distribution for purposes of Code section 401(a)(9) and Plan section 7.6. 
              (6) 
    The distribution required by this Plan section may be made notwithstanding any other Plan provision. 
      
  6.4         Discrimination Limits on Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions, and Adjustment Contributions 
  As of the last day of each Plan Year, the Administrative Committee shall require testing of Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions, and Adjustment Contributions made for the Plan Year for Participants, who were not Represented Employees for the period for which the contributions were made, to assure that the Average Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year of such Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the limits specified in the ACP Test. The rules of this section shall not apply at all to Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions, and Adjustment Contributions made for the Plan Year for Participants who are Represented Employees for the period for which the contributions are made. 
           (a) 
    Aggregation, Disaggregation and Restructuring.   The rules of this section shall be administered so as to comply with the mandatory disaggregation requirements of Treasury Regulations section 1.410(b) 7(c) and, if the Administrative Committee chooses, the permissive aggregation rules of Treasury Regulations section 1.410(b) 7(d), provided that any aggregated plans shall use the same testing method under Treasury Regulations section 1.401(k) 2(a)(2)(ii) (  i.e.  , current year or prior year testing method) as is used by the Plan for the Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2004, the mandatory disaggregation rules relating to the ESOP and non ESOP portions of the Plan shall not apply. 
              (1) 
    If, after application of the mandatory disaggregation rules, in the preceding paragraph, this Plan is permissively aggregated with one or more other plans that include matching or after tax contributions subject to contribution testing under Code section 401(m) for purposes of Code section 401(a)(4) or 410(b), then this Plan and such other plans shall be treated as one arrangement for purposes of this Plan section.  
              (2) 
    In determining whether the restrictions of this Plan section are met, the Administrative Committee may exclude from the ACP Test all Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees and who have not met the minimum age and service requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A), if the Administrative Committee elects to apply Code section 410(b)(4)(B). Alternatively, the Administrative Committee may apply the ACP Test separately to all Eligible Employees who have not met the minimum age and service requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A). 
              (b) 
    ACP Test  . The Average Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year of Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees shall not exceed the greater of: 
              (1) 
    The product of 1.25 and the Average Contribution Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year; or 
              (2) 
    The lesser of: 
              (A) 
    The product of two and the Average Contribution Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year, or 
              (B) 
    The Average Contribution Percentage for the current Plan Year for the Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the current Plan Year plus two percentage points. 
     By an amendment to the Plan, the Administrative Committee may elect to apply paragraphs (1) and (2) by using the Average Contribution Percentage of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the preceding Plan Year rather than the current Plan Year except that such election may not be changed unless permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. 
           (c) 
    The restrictions of this section shall be based on the Participant s actual Testing Compensation while an Active Participant and total Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions allocated to the Participant s Account for the Plan Year. The Administrative Committee is authorized to restrict the After Tax Contributions of Highly Compensated Employees in a uniform manner if it determines, based on advance testing done during the Plan Year, that such restriction is necessary or appropriate to assure final Plan Year compliance with restrictions of this section. 
      
  6.5         Corrective Measures if ACP Test Failed 
  If, at the end of the Plan Year, the Administrative Committee determines that the Average Contribution Percentage of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the maximum permitted for the Plan Year under the ACP Test, then the Administrative Committee shall take the corrective steps described in this Plan section so that the requirements of Plan section 6.4 are met for the Plan Year. Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions, and Adjustment Contributions, along with any other matching contributions and after tax contributions (including any recharacterized elective deferrals) made to other Qualified Plans that are included the Actual Deferral Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, exceeding the ACP Test limits are referred to as Excess Aggregate Contributions. 
           (a) 
    Correction Method  . The Administrative Committee shall distribute or forfeit Excess Aggregate Contributions, along with allocable investment gains and losses, pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.401(m) 2(b)(2) and this Plan section. 
              (b) 
    Determining Total Excess Aggregate Contributions  . The amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions attributable to each Highly Compensated Employee is the amount by which Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions, along with any other matching contributions and after tax contributions (including any recharacterized elective deferrals) made to other Qualified Plans that are included the Average Contribution Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, must be reduced so that the Average Contribution Percentage for that Highly Compensated Employee is reduced to the maximum permissible Average Contribution Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees. The maximum permissible Average Contribution Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees is determined by reducing the Average Contribution Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest Average Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year to the Average Contribution Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest Average Contribution Percentage. If a lesser reduction would enable the ACP Test to be satisfied, only the lesser reduction is used to determine the maximum permissible Average Contribution Percentage. This procedure is repeated until the ACP Test would be satisfied. The total amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions to be corrected is equal to the sum of the dollar amounts computed under this subsection for each Highly Compensated Employee and is be referred to as the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions. 
              (c) 
    Apportionment of Total Excess Aggregate Contributions  . Total Excess Aggregate Contributions for the Plan Year shall be apportioned as provided in this subsection. 
              (1) 
    Excess Aggregate Contributions allocated to the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest dollar amount of Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions taken into account under the ACP Test for the Plan Year shall be reduced by the amount required to cause that Highly Compensated Employee s remaining amount of Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions for the Plan Year to be equal to the dollar amount of Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions for the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest dollar amount. This amount shall be allocated as the Excess Aggregate Contribution for the Highly Compensated Employee, unless a smaller reduction, when added to the total dollar amount already allocated as Excess Aggregate Contributions for other Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to this procedure equals the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions for the Plan Year.  
              (2) 
    If a Highly Compensated Employee s Excess Aggregate Contributions include matching contributions and after tax contributions (including any recharacterized elective deferrals) made to other Qualified Plans that are included the Average Contribution Percentage of a Highly Compensated Employee, then the Excess Aggregate Contribution of that to the Highly Compensated Employee shall not exceed the Matching Contributions, After Tax Contributions and Adjustment Contributions made under this Plan for the Plan Year. Any portion of the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions which is apportioned to a Highly Compensated Employee pursuant to this subsection, but which cannot be corrected because of the preceding sentence, shall be apportioned to the Highly Compensated Employee with the next lowest total dollar amount of Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions and that Highly Compensated Employee s Excess Aggregate Contributions shall be reduced by an amount which includes the amount not corrected for the other Highly Compensated Employee. 
              (3) 
    If the total amount corrected under this subsection is less than the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions for the Plan Year, the procedure in this paragraph shall be repeated until the total amount corrected is equal to the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions for the Plan Year. 
              (4) 
    The investment gains and losses allocable to the Excess Aggregate Contributions are equal only to the sum of allocable investment gains and losses for the Plan Year for which the distribution is made. The allocable investment gain or loss attributable to the Excess Aggregate Contributions may be determined in accordance with any of the methods permitted under Treasury Regulations section 1.401(m) 2(b)(2)(iv), disregarding any provisions relating to the distribution of gap period earnings, and may be determined up to seven days before the date of the correction. 
              (d) 
    Distribution or Forfeiture  . Excess Aggregate Contributions shall not be treated as corrected even if distributed under this subsection, unless the requirements of this subsection are met. 
              (1) 
    Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses must be distributed to the Highly Compensated Employee to whom it has been allocated within 12 months after the close of the Plan Year for which the Excess Aggregate Contribution arose. 
              (2) 
    Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses shall be distributed or, to the extent attributable to Matching Contributions in which the Highly Compensated Employee is not fully vested as of the end of the Plan Year, forfeited in the following order: 
              (A) 
    After Tax Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses on which Matching Contributions were not made; 
              (B) 
    Adjustment Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses on which Matching Contributions were not made; 
              (C) 
    After Tax Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses along with the corresponding Matching Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses; and 
              (D) 
    Adjustment Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses along with the corresponding Matching Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses. 
              (3) 
    The distributed Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses shall be taken from the Investment Funds in which the subaccount is then invested on a pro rata basis. 
              (4) 
    If the Highly Compensated Employee received a full distribution of his or her Account before Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses is distributed to the Highly Compensated Employee, then the prior distribution shall be reported for taxation purposes as first a correction of Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses to the extent required under this Plan section. 
              (5) 
    A distribution of Excess Aggregate Contributions and allocable investment gains and losses shall in no event be treated as satisfying a required minimum distribution for purposes of Code section 401(a)(9) and Plan section 7.6. 
              (6) 
    The distribution required by this Plan section may be made notwithstanding any other Plan provision. 
      
  6.6         Limitation on Annual Additions 
           (a) 
    General Rule  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, the total Annual Additions under this Plan and any other defined contribution plan, as defined in Code section 414(i), maintained by the Company or any Affiliate, allocated to a Participant s Account for any Plan Year, which shall be the limitation year for purposes of Code section 415, shall not exceed the lesser of: 
               (2) 
    100 percent of the Participant s Section 415 Compensation for the limitation year. 
              (b) 
     Annual Addition  Defined  . The term  Annual Addition,  with respect to any Participant for a Plan Year, shall mean the aggregate of: 
              (1) 
    The amount of Employer contributions (including Matching Contributions and Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions other than Catch Up Contributions) allocated to the Participant s Account under this Plan and any other Employer contributions (other than Catch Up Contributions under Code Section 414(v)) allocated under any other defined contribution plan, as defined in Code section 414(i), maintained by the Company or any Affiliate for the Plan Year; 
              (2) 
    The amount of a Participant s After Tax Contributions (including Adjustment Contributions, but excluding Rollover and Roth Rollover Contributions) allocated to the Participant s Account under this Plan and any other Employee contributions allocated under any other defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate for the Plan Year; 
              (3) 
    Forfeitures allocated to the Participant s Account under this Plan or any other defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate for the Plan Year; and  
              (4) 
    For the purpose of Plan section 6.6(a)(1) only, the amount of Employer contributions, if any, allocated to an account described in Code section 419A(d)(1) or an account described in Code section 415(l)(2). 
     For purposes of this subsection and to comply with the requirements of Code section 415(h), the term  Affiliate  includes, in addition to Affiliates defined in Plan section 2.1(i), any entity that would be an Affiliate under that definition if the phrase  more than 50 percent  were substituted for the phrase  at least 80 percent  each place it appears in Code 1563(a)(1). 
           (c) 
    Additional Rules.   In applying the limits of subsection (a), the following rules shall apply: 
              (1) 
    Excess Deferrals shall not be included as an Annual Addition if they are distributed in a corrective distribution under the provisions of that section. However, any Excess Deferrals that are not distributed in a corrective distribution under Plan section 6.1 shall be included as an Annual Addition, even if they are in excess of the Code section 402(g)(1) limit. 
              (2) 
    Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions in excess of the ADP Test limits of Plan section 6.2 shall be included as an Annual Addition, even if they are correctively distributed or re characterized as Adjustment Contributions under Plan section 6.3. 
              (3) 
    Matching Contributions and After Tax Contributions (including any Adjustment Contributions) in excess of the ACP Test limits of Plan section 6.4 shall be included as an Annual Addition, even if they are correctively forfeited or distributed under Plan section 6.5. Matching Contributions relating to distributions of Excess Deferrals under Plan section 6.1(d) are forfeited and shall not be included as an Annual Addition. 
              (4) 
    If a short limitation year is created because of an amendment or other action changing the limitation year (or Plan Year) to a different 12 consecutive month period, the dollar limitation of Plan section 6.6(a)(1) to be applied for that short limitation year shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short limitation year and the denominator of which is 12. 
              (5) 
    The Annual Additions of a Participant who is also a Supplemental Plan Participant for the Plan Year shall be determined under this paragraph if doing so results in a larger amount of Annual Additions for that Participant for the Plan Year. Annual Additions under this paragraph shall be determined by assuming that, for the Plan Year, the Participant contributed the contribution percentage limit in effect for the Participant as determined under Appendix E and received the maximum allocation of Matching Contribution under Plan section 5.2. 
              (d) 
       Disposition of Excess Annual Additions 
              (1) 
    Not a Supplemental Plan Participant  . If the Participant is not also a Supplemental Plan Participant for the Plan Year, then the Participant s Annual Additions shall be reduced under this Plan, if such reduction is required for purposes of reducing allocations on a combined basis, to the limits of subsection (a) and Code section 415(c), as follows: 
              (A) 
    First, by distributing After Tax Contributions (including any Adjustment Contributions) made for the Plan Year to the Participant, to the extent necessary; and  
              (B) 
    Next, by distributing Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions made for the Plan Year to the Participant, to the extent necessary; and  
              (C) 
    Then, forfeiting Matching Contributions made for the Plan Year, to the extent necessary; and 
              (D) 
    Finally, reducing any remaining excess Annual Additions under the terms of such other defined contribution plans maintained by the Company or any Affiliate as specified in those plans.  
              (2) 
    Supplemental Plan Participant  . If the Participant is also a Supplemental Plan Participant for the Plan Year, then the Participant s Annual Additions shall first be reduced under the terms of the Retirement Plan for the Plan Year by reducing the allocations made under the Retirement Plan to the extent necessary to assure compliance with the limits of subsection (a) and Code section 415(c). Only after reductions under the Retirement Plan have been made shall reductions of Annual Additions be made under the terms of this Plan and such other defined contribution plans maintained by the Company or any Affiliate, if such a reduction is required for purposes of reducing allocations on a combined basis, to the limit of subsection (a) and Code section 415(c), as follows: 
              (A) 
    First, by distributing After Tax Contributions (including any Adjustment Contributions) made for the Plan Year to the Participant, to the extent necessary; and  
              (B) 
    Next, by distributing Pretax Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions made for the Plan Year to the Participant, to the extent necessary; and  
              (C) 
    Then, forfeiting Matching Contributions made for the Plan Year, to the extent necessary; and 
              (D) 
    Finally, reducing any remaining excess Annual Additions under the terms of such other defined contribution plans (other than the Retirement Plan) maintained by the Company or any Affiliate as specified in those plans. 
              (e) 
    Adjustment of Allocations  . If an allocation to the Account of a Participant would exceed the limit of subsection (a) due to a reasonable mistake in estimating a Participant s Section 415 Compensation or due to forfeitures or a reasonable error in the estimation of salary deferrals, then any amount which cannot be allocated shall be held in a suspense account and shall be allocated to the Account of such Participant in the next following Plan Year. The suspense account shall not share in investment gains or losses of the Trust Fund. Effective for Plan Years beginning after July 1, 2007, this subsection shall no longer apply because this correction methodology is no longer permitted under the final Treasury Regulations under Code section 415. 
      
  6.7         Limitation on Pay Taken Into Account 
           (a) 
    In determining the amount of Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions that may be made on behalf of a Participant for a Plan Year, the total amount of Earnings to which the percentage reduction, elected by the Participant, is applied shall not be limited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the total annual amount of Pretax Deferrals and Roth Contributions made for a Plan Year on behalf of the Participant shall not exceed the product of the maximum deferral percentage allowed under the Plan for the Plan Year multiplied by the compensation limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 401(a)(17). 
              (b) 
    In determining the amount of After Tax Contributions that may be made on behalf of a Participant for a Plan Year, the total amount of Earnings to which the percentage reduction, elected by the Participant, is applied shall not be limited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the total annual amount of After Tax Contributions made for a Plan Year on behalf of the Participant shall not exceed the product of the maximum contribution percentage allowed under the Plan for the Plan Year multiplied by the compensation limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 401(a)(17). 
              (c) 
    In determining the amount of Matching Contributions that may be made on behalf of a Participant for a Plan Year, the total amount of Earnings to which the Matching Contribution is applied shall not be limited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the total annual amount of Matching Contributions made for a Plan Year on behalf of an Active Participant shall not exceed the product of the matching percentage determined under Appendix F multiplied by the maximum amount of Earnings for which Matching Contributions are determined multiplied by the compensation limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 401(a)(17). 
      
  6.8         Deductibility Limitation 
  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the dollar amount of Employer contributions to this Plan are conditioned on their deductibility under Code section 404 and, thus, shall always be limited to the amount deductible under Code section 404 for the taxable year for which such contributions are paid to the Trust Fund. 
   
  Article 7.         Benefit Distributions 
   
  7.1         Distributions Generally 
  Distribution of a Participant s vested Account may begin pursuant to Plan section 7.2, relating to in service withdrawals, Plan section 7.3, relating to benefit payments on account of a Separation from Service, and Plan section 7.5, relating to death benefit distributions, as applicable under the terms of this Article, but not later than the date provided in Plan section 7.6, relating to required minimum distributions. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant s Pretax Account and Roth Account may not be distributed earlier than upon one of the following events: 
           (a) 
    The Participant s retirement, death, Disability, or Separation from Service; 
              (b) 
    The termination of the Plan without the establishment of another defined contribution plan (other than an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Code section 4975(e)(7)), provided that distributions made under this paragraph may be made only in the form of a single lump sum that complies with Code section 401(k)(10)(B); or  
              (c) 
    The Participant s attainment of age 59  or, if the Plan is amended to so provide, a financial hardship of the Participant. 
      
  7.2         In Service Withdrawals 
           (a) 
    An Active Participant or Inactive Participant may withdraw, prior to his or her Separation from Service, in the following order, any amount, up to 100 percent of the sum of the Participant s: 
              (1) 
    After Tax Account, if any; 
              (2) 
    Rollover Account, if any;  
              (3) 
    Pretax Account, but only if the Participant has attained age 59  and then 
              (4) 
    Matching Account, but only if the Participant has completed at least three years of Service. 
              (b) 
    Effective January 1, 2017, an Active Participant or Inactive Participant also may withdraw, prior to his or her Separation from Service, any amount, up to 100 percent of the sum of the Participant s, without regard to Section 7.2(e) below: 
              (1) 
    Roth Account, but only if the Participant has attained age 59  
              (2) 
    Roth Rollover Account; or 
              (3) 
    In-Plan Roth Rollover Account, but only if the Participant has attained age 59 . 
              (c) 
    No withdrawal may be requested in any processing period in which a plan loan, as described in Article 8, is being processed. Furthermore, no withdrawal request may be processed more often than once in any six month period beginning with the date that the Participant s most recent withdrawal request was processed.  Effective August 8, 2016, there will be no restriction on the timing of withdrawal requests or the coordination of withdrawal requests with the processing of loan or other requests under the Plan. 
              (d) 
    Application for a withdrawal shall be made on such forms as the Administrative Committee prescribes and shall be effective as of the end of the processing period in which such application is received and approved by the Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee shall direct the Trustee, in such cases, to pay the Participant or Inactive Participant the withdrawal amount in a single sum. 
              (e) 
    Withdrawals shall be paid first out of the net cumulative pre 1987 contributions from the After Tax Account. Withdrawals shall then be paid out of the net cumulative post 1986 contributions, together with earnings thereon, on a pro rata basis, from the After Tax Account. Additional amounts shall be withdrawn, if needed, from earnings on pre 1987 contributions from the After Tax Account, then from the Rollover Account, if any, then from the Pretax Account, if permissible, and then from the Matching Account, to the extent permissible. The amount withdrawn shall be taken from such Investment Funds in which the subaccount is invested on a pro rata basis. 
              (f) 
    A withdrawal from a Participant s Account balances invested in Oxy Stock shall be in the form of full shares of Oxy Stock and cash representing any fractional share, except that cash shall be paid in lieu of full shares of Oxy Stock if the Participant specified in the written request for withdrawal that the withdrawal be in the form of cash. A withdrawal from Account balances invested in assets other than Oxy Stock shall be paid in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a withdrawal consisting of pre 1987 contributions from the After Tax Account only shall be in the form of cash. 
     (g)       
           (1) 
    Except as provided below, if a Participant withdraws any amount from the Matching Account, the Participant (other than a Participant who has attained age 59  at the time the withdrawal is requested and who withdraws the entire balance in his or her Account) shall not be permitted to make any Pretax Deferrals, Catch-Up Contributions, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions, or receive Matching Contributions for a period of six calendar months after the withdrawal is processed.  Effective for withdrawals requested after August 8, 2016, if a Participant is suspended from making any Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions, and/or After Tax Contributions in accordance with the sentence above, such contributions will be automatically reinstated upon expiration of the six-month suspension period at the Default Percentage, as applicable, or if the Participant was not subject to automatic enrollment or had opted out of automatic enrollment at the percentage in place prior to the suspension.    Effective January 1, 2017, unless the Participant affirmatively elects otherwise, with respect to any Participant hired prior to August 5, 2016, upon re-instatement, the election in effect as of August 5, 2016 will apply to any Annual Bonus paid in the 2017 Plan Year and any subsequent plan year until the Participant affirmatively elects otherwise.

The failure of a Participant to elect a distribution of benefits upon his or her Separation from Service shall be deemed to be an election by the Participant to defer the commencement of benefits. 
              (b)

The provisions of this subsection are intended to comply with the stock distribution requirements of Code sections 409(h) and 409(o) applicable to the portion of this Plan constituting an employee stock ownership plan, as required by Code section 4975(e)(7). Notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary, the Administrative Committee shall take steps to ensure that this section is interpreted and administered so as to comply with such requirements. In the event of any conflict, the rules of the Code and Treasury Regulations shall control.

ESOP) as soon as practicable to the Oxy Stock Fund and distributing such amounts as soon as practicable thereafter. 
              (3)

              (A) 
    Oxy Stock is readily tradable on established securities market within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(5). Thus, the provisions of this paragraph (3) shall apply only in the event and to the extent that as of the date of distribution of Oxy Stock, the Oxy Stock is not readily tradable on established securities market or is subject to a trading limitation.  
              (B) 
    If Oxy Stock is not readily tradable on established securities market or is subject to a trading limitation when distributed, the distributee shall have the option to sell (the  put option ) such Oxy Stock, in whole or in part, to the Company. The put option shall be granted in accordance with Code section 409(h) and all applicable Treasury Regulations. Specifically, the put option shall provide that for a period of at least 60 days following the date of distribution of the Oxy Stock and, if not exercised within such period of 60 days, during the first 60 days in the following Plan Year, the distributee shall have the right to have the Company purchase such shares at their fair market value, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 54.4975-11(d)(5), as of the Valuation Date coincident with or immediately preceding the date of exercise of such put option. The put option may be exercised by notifying the Employer in writing that the option is being exercised.  
              (C) 
    Once the put option is exercised, the fair market value of such shares shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to adopt a different payment schedule at any time, but such payment schedule shall not be longer than in annual installments over a period of five years, with interest on the deferred balance at a reasonable rate as determined by the Administrative Committee; provided that any purchase of stock having a value of $1,000 or less shall be paid for in a lump sum. 
              (D) 
    The provisions of this paragraph (3) shall continue to apply to Oxy Stock if the Oxy Stock Fund ceases to be an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Code section 4975(e)(7). 
              (E) 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph (3) need not apply to that portion of an Account which the Participant has elected to invest under the diversification provisions of Plan section 9.5. 
              (f) 
    Payments to Alternate Payees  . To the extent permitted by the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, amounts assigned to an Alternate Payee may be paid as soon as possible in a lump sum, notwithstanding the age, employment status, or other factors affecting the ability of the Participant to make a withdrawal or otherwise to receive a distribution of amounts allocated to the Participant s Account, provided that the total amount assigned to an Alternate Payee does not exceed $5,000 at the time the amount is distributed or, if the amount assigned does exceed $5,000, the Alternate Payee consents in writing to the distribution. Only if required under the Qualified Domestic Relations Order, an Alternate Payee s Account may be distributed under one of the optional payment forms specified in subsection (c), if elected by the Alternate Payee in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee.

    Participant s Death Before Benefit Commencement  .

  7.6         Required Minimum Distributions 
  This section applies for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for distribution Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2003. In other words, this section provides the latest time for distributions to be made or commenced. Other Plan provisions may specify earlier dates for distributions and such provisions shall govern to the extent they are consistent with this section. This section, however, takes precedence over any inconsistent Plan provision. All distributions required under this section shall be determined and made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements, which are incorporated herein by this reference. For purposes of this Plan section, the required minimum distribution amount shall be determined based on the Account balance as of the last Accounting Date in the Plan Year immediately preceding the Distribution Calendar Year, increased by contributions made and allocated as of dates in the Plan Year after the last Accounting Date, if any, and reduced by distributions made in the Plan Year after the last Accounting Date, if any.   The Account balance for the Plan Year   immediately preceding the Distribution Calendar Year   includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the Plan in the Plan Year. 
           (a) 
    Form of Distribution  . Unless the Participant s Account is distributed in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions will be made in accordance with subsections (b) and (c).  All required minimum distributions will be made in cash, and there will be no requirement to issue any shares of Oxy Stock.    
              (b) 
    Required Minimum Distributions During Participant s Lifetime  . The Participant s entire Account will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant s Required Beginning Date. During the Participant s lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the amount determined under the default rule of paragraph (1) or, if the Participant satisfies the conditions in a timely manner, under the alternative rule of (2): 
              (1) 
    Default Rule  . The quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulations section 1.401(a)(9) 9, using the Participant s age as of the Participant s birthday in each Distribution Calendar Year.  
              (2) 
    Alternative Rule  . If the Participant s sole Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant s Spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulations section 1.401(a)(9) 9, using the Participant s and Spouse s attained ages as of the Participant s and Spouse s birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. For this alternative rule to apply, the Participant must request its application and provide such proof of marriage and the Spouse s age, at such time and in such manner as the Administrative Committee may reasonably require, in advance of the Distribution Calendar Year. 
     Required minimum distributions will be determined under this subsection beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and redetermined for each subsequent Distribution Calendar Year up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant s date of death. 
    
           (c) 
    Required Minimum Distributions After Participant s Death  . 
              (1) 
    Death of Participant On or After Date Distributions Begin  . 
              (A) 
    Participant Survived by One Beneficiary  . If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a sole Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account balance by the remaining Life Expectancy, determined as follows: 
              (i) 
    If the Participant is not married or the sole Beneficiary is not the Participant s surviving Spouse, the remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
              (ii) 
    If the Participant s surviving Spouse is the Participant s sole Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant s death using the surviving Spouse s age as of the Spouse s birthday in that year. For the Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the surviving Spouse s death, any remaining payment shall be made in a single sum to the Spouse s estate. 
              (B) 
    Participant Survived by More Than One Beneficiary  . If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is more than one Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant s death, the Participant s remaining Account shall be paid in a single sum as required by Plan section 7.5.  
              (C) 
    No Beneficiary Survives the Participant  . If there is no Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant s death, the Participant s remaining Account will be paid in a single sum to the Participant s estate no later than the Distribution Calendar Year after the Participant s death.  
              (2) 
    Death of Participant Before Date Distributions Begin  . If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant s Account balance will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than provided in this paragraph. The minimum amount that will be distributed or begin to be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant s death is the amount determined in paragraph (1) above.  
              (A) 
    If the Participant s surviving Spouse is the Participant s sole Beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving Spouse will begin no later than: 
              (i) 
    December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died; or 
              (ii) 
    December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 , if later. 
              (B) 
    If the Participant s surviving Spouse is the Participant s sole Beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse begin, this subsection, other than subparagraph (A) immediately above, will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant. 
     If the Participant s surviving Spouse is not the Participant s sole Beneficiary, then distributions to the Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. 
           (C) 
    If there is no Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant s death, the Participant s Account balance will be distributed to the Participant s estate no later than by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death. 
              (d)

     Eligible Retirement Plan    is an individual retirement account described in Code section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract), an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a), a qualified trust described in Code section 401(a) that accepts the Distributee s Eligible Rollover Distribution, an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b); an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan; and a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A(b). 
              (4) 
     Eligible Rollover Distribution    means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include: 
              (A) 
    Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee and the Distributee s designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 
              (B) 
    Any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under Code section 401(a)(9) and related Treasury Regulations;

    A distribution that is a permissible withdrawal from an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w); and 
              (F) 
    The portion of any distribution shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because such portion consists of After-Tax Contributions, which are not includable in gross income, if such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Code section 408(a) or (b), to a qualified plan described in Code section 401(a) or 403(a), or to an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable. The portion of any distribution from a designated Roth account under the Plan shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution if such portion is transferred to another Roth account under an applicable retirement plan described in Code Section 402A(e)(1) or a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A. 
     Determinations of what constitutes an Eligible Rollover Distribution shall at all times be made in accordance with the current rules under Code section 402(c), which shall be controlling for this purpose. 
           (G) 
     Conversion    means a Direct Rollover of an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan to the Roth IRA, within the meaning of Code section 408A. The amount rolled over is included in the gross income of the Distributee to the same extent that such amount would have been included in gross income if not rolled over.

  7.8         In-Plan Roth Rollovers 
           (a) 
    Participant Eligibility.    Effective for distributions made on or after January 1, 2017, a Participant may elect to roll over a distribution to an In-Plan Roth Rollover Account in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.8.  A Participant may elect to rollover amounts held in the accounts described below in Section 7.8(b) without regard to whether the Participant satisfies the requirements for distribution in accordance with this Article VII.  In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions shall be subject to the same Plan rules as Roth Contributions. The Plan Administrator will maintain such records as are necessary for the proper reporting of In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions and will administer the In-Plan Roth Rollover Account in accordance with Code Section 402A and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
              (b) 
    Permitted Sources.    The following contributions are permitted for roll over to the In-Plan Roth Rollover Account:  
              (1) 
    After-Tax Account, 
              (2) 
    Matching Account,  
              (3) 
    Pretax Account,   
              (4) 
    Rollover Account, and 
              (5) 
    SIP Accounts noted in Appendix H.1. 
              (c) 
    Participant s Spouse.    Solely for the purposes of determining eligibility for an In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution, the Plan will treat a Participant s surviving Spouse, former Spouse or Alternate Payee Spouse as a Participant.  A non-spouse beneficiary may not make an In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution to the Plan. 
              (d) 
    Form of Rollover.    An In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution must be made by the Participant in the form of a direct rollover.  An In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution may not include Plan loans.  
              (e) 
    Distributions.    The distribution provisions in Section 7.1 will apply to In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions. 
              (f) 
    Treatment of In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions.    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, an In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution is not a Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution for purposes of the Plan.  Except for amounts withheld pursuant to a voluntary withholding election, an In-Plan Roth Rollover Contribution will not be treated as a distribution for purposes of sections 72(p), 401(a)(11), or 411(d)(6)(B)(ii) of the Code.  Amounts in a Participant s In-Plan Roth Rollover Account may only be withdrawn by a Participant when the Participant is eligible for a distribution from the Plan under Article VII. 
      
  Article 8.         Participant Loans 
   
  8.1         Availability of Loans

Loans shall (a) be made available on a reasonably equivalent basis, (b) not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount equal to a greater percentage of their vested Account balance or the percent made available to other loan applicants, (c) bear a reasonable rate of interest, and (d) be adequately secured by the Participant s vested Account balance.  
   
  8.2         Amount of Loan  
  No loan (when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans made by the Plan to the Participant) shall exceed the lesser of: 
           (a) 
    Fifty percent of the Participant s vested Account, or 
              (b) 
    Fifty thousand dollars, reduced by the highest outstanding balance of his or her loans from the Plan during the one year period ending on the date the loan is made over the outstanding balance of all of his or her Plan loans on the date on which such loan was made. 
     For the purpose of this limitation, all loans from all plans of the Employer are aggregated.   
   
  8.3         Procedures for Loans

  Article 9.         Investment Elections 
   
  9.1         Investment of Contributions 
  All Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions, Adjustment Contributions, Catch Up Contributions, Rollover Contributions, Roth Rollover Contributions, In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions and loan repayments (both principal and interest) made by and on behalf of a Participant each Plan Year and amounts merged into the Plan shall be invested as the Participant shall designate in the Investment Funds then available in increments of 1 percent of the aggregate amount of such contributions. Participants may invest up to 30% of future Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions, In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions and After-Tax Contributions in the Oxy Stock Fund, but no new Rollover Contributions or Roth Rollover Contributions may be invested in the Oxy Stock Fund.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a Participant may not transfer any investment into the Oxy Stock Fund, other than investments transferred from the CRC Stock Fund, if the combined amounts a Participant holds under the CRC Stock Fund and the Oxy Stock Fund exceed 30% of the Participant s total Plan balance. 
  Each Participant may make the designation described above by making an election in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee upon becoming a Participant and may change such election at any time by making another election in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee. Any such election shall take effect as of the first available pay period after the election was received by the Administrative Committee.  
  The selection of any Investment Fund is the sole and exclusive responsibility of each Participant, and it is intended that the selection of an Investment Fund by each Participant be within the parameters of section 404(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ) and the regulations thereunder.  Neither the Employer, Administrative Committee, Investment Committee nor any of the directors, officers, agents or Employees of the Employer are empowered to or shall be permitted to advise a Participant as to the manner in which his Accounts shall be invested or changed. No liability whatsoever shall be imposed upon the Employer, the Trustees, any Committee member, or any director, officer, agent or Employee of the Employer for any loss resulting to a Participant s account because of any sale or investment directed by a Participant under this section or because of the Participant s failure to take any action regarding an investment acquired pursuant to such elective investment. 
  In the event that a Participant fails, or continues to fail, to designate the Investment Fund in which Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, After Tax Contributions, Adjustment Contributions, Catch Up Contributions, Rollover Contributions, Roth Rollover Contributions, In-Plan Roth Rollover Contributions, loan repayments, or amounts merged into the Plan that are to be invested, such amounts shall be invested in the Diversified Balance Fund. 
  Any amount previously defaulted into an Investment Fund due to a Participant s failure to designate an Investment Fund shall not be re-designated or transferred, unless the Participant otherwise transfers such amount in accordance with Plan section 9.2(a). The Diversified Balance Fund is the Plan s qualified default investment alternative, as this term is defined in Department of Labor Regulations section 2550.404c 5(e). 
  Matching Contributions made on behalf of a Participant shall be invested in the Oxy Stock Fund. 
   
  9.2         Transfers of Existing Balances 
           (a) 
    General Rules  . Subject to any investment limitation or restriction imposed by the Investment Fund and except as provided in Plan section 9.5, each Participant, including Inactive Participants and Former Participants, as well as each Alternate Payee or spousal Beneficiary with an Account under the Plan may elect to transfer, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee, amounts invested in any Investment Fund to one or more Investment Funds then available in increments of 1 percent of the amount being transferred. If the election is received by the Administrative Committee by 4 p.m. (Central Time) on an Accounting Date, the transfer will be processed on that Accounting Date. Each election made under this Plan section shall be effective as of the first Accounting Date after the date in which notice thereof is received by the Administrative Committee. If the election is received by the Administrative Committee after 4 p.m. (Central Time) or on a date other than an Accounting Date, the transfer will be processed on the next Accounting Date. The Administrative Committee may impose such Investment Fund transfer fees as it deems reasonable and appropriate to defray the administrative expenses of the Plan. Any transfer of existing balances made under this Plan section does not affect the investment of future contributions, including loan repayments and amounts merged into this Plan, which will be invested as provided under Plan section 9.1 and the last investment election of the Participant filed thereunder. 
              (b) 
    Oxy Stock Fund Transfers  .

    Effective January 1, 2015, a vested Participant may not transfer any investment (other than investments transferred from the CRC Stock Fund) into the Oxy Stock Fund if the combined amounts a Participant holds under the CRC Stock Fund and the Oxy Stock Fund exceed 55% of the Participant s total Plan balance. 
              (2) 
    Effective June 1, 2015, a vested Participant may not transfer any investment (other than investments transferred from the CRC Stock Fund) into the Oxy Stock Fund if the combined amounts a Participant holds under the CRC Stock Fund and the Oxy Stock Fund exceed 30% of the Participant s total Plan balance. 
              (c) 
    Qualified Plan Transfers  . Nothing contained in this Plan section shall be construed as preventing a Participant, including Inactive Participants and Former Participants, from having amounts allocated to his or her Account in any Investment Fund transferred to one or more other Investment Funds for the purpose of facilitating an asset transfer to the trustee of a Qualified Plan sponsored by a purchaser or the subsidiary of a purchaser as a result of a transaction involving the sale by the Company or an Affiliate of either all or substantially all of the outstanding common stock of an Affiliate or all or substantially all of the assets of a facility, under circumstances where the Participant or Inactive Participant is employed by the Affiliate or at the facility that is the subject of the sale. 
      
  9.3         Transfer of Assets 
  The Administrative Committee shall direct the Trustee to transfer monies or other property between Investment Funds as soon as is practicable after each Accounting Date to the extent required to carry out the aggregate contribution and transfer transactions as of such Accounting Date after the necessary entries have been made in the Accounts and offsetting transfer elections have been reconciled, in accordance with uniform rules established by the Administrative Committee.

  Article 10.         Participant Accounts and Records of the Plan 
   
  10.1         Accounts and Records 
  The Participant s Pretax Account, Roth Account, Matching Account, After Tax Account, Rollover Account, Roth Rollover Account and In-Plan Roth Rollover Account shall be assigned a subaccount for each Investment Fund in which the Account is invested. Each such subaccount shall be maintained and valued separately from all other subaccounts. The Administrative Committee shall maintain records relative to a Participant s Accounts so that there may be determined as of any Accounting Date the current market value of his Accounts in the Trust Fund. 
  Each Participant, Alternate Payee and Beneficiary with an Account shall be advised from time to time, at least once each Plan Year, as to the value of his or her Account and the portions thereof attributable to his or her Matching Account and the sum of his or her Pretax Account, Roth Account, Matching Account, After Tax Account, Rollover Account, Roth Rollover Account and In-Plan Roth Rollover Account and to the various Investment Funds. 
   
  10.2         Account Value 
  As of any given date for which determination of the value of an Account is required, such value shall equal the sum of the value of Pretax Account, Roth Account, Matching Account, After Tax Account, Rollover Account, Roth Rollover Account and In-Plan Roth Rollover Account as of the preceding Accounting Date plus any additional contributions withheld or paid and less the amount of any withdrawals from such Account after the Accounting Date and prior to the date of determination. 
   
  10.3         Investment Funds 
  The Trust Fund shall consist of the Investment Funds, and each Account invested in an Investment Fund shall have an undivided proportionate interest in that Investment Fund. The Investment Committee shall have the right to determine the number of Investment Funds to be maintained by the Plan, and to increase or decrease that number from time to time as it deems appropriate. The Investment Committee shall establish additional Investment Funds or eliminate existing Investment Funds. In so doing, the Investment Committee shall implement and carry out investment objectives and policies which it shall establish and maintain. 
   
  10.4         Unit Value of Investment Funds 
  As of each Accounting Date, the Trustee shall determine the fair market value of the assets of each Investment Fund, and shall notify the Administrative Committee of the value so determined. Assets for which there is a readily ascertainable market shall be valued by the Trustee at their fair market value, determined by the last known public sale on the Accounting Date as of which the market value is determined. In the absence of a sale on the Accounting Date, the fair market value of such assets, as well as other assets for which there is no readily ascertainable fair market value, shall be determined by the Trustee in such consistent manner as the Trustee shall consider appropriate. 
   
  10.5         Calculation of Unit Value 
  The Trustee shall divide the aggregate value of the assets of each Investment Fund, as so determined, by the total number of outstanding Units in such Investment Fund on the Accounting Date. The result obtained shall be the new value of each Unit, or  Unit value,  as of the Accounting Date. The Unit value for all Investment Funds shall be ten dollars on the first Accounting Date in 1999. 
   
  10.6         Valuation Adjustments 
  As of each Accounting Date, after the Units in each Investment Fund have been revalued, the Administrative Committee shall adjust the balances in the Accounts in the respective Investment Funds of the Trust Fund, upward or downward, in proportion to the Account balance in the Investment Fund as of the previous Accounting Date. As a result, the sum of such Account balances will equal the net value of each Investment Fund of the Trust Fund as of that Accounting Date. The subaccounts shall then, when appropriate, be credited with additional Units by dividing the dollar amount of contributions, fund transfers, loan repayments, and dividends paid with respect to Oxy Stock to be allocated to each subaccount on that Accounting Date by the newly calculated value of a Unit in the Investment Fund. 
   
  10.7         Debiting of Accounts upon Distribution, Withdrawal, Loan or Charge 
  Any Units distributed or withdrawn from an Account (including any Units debited as a result of an Investment Fund transfer fee or redemption fee imposed pursuant to Plan section 9.2) shall be charged to the respective subaccounts in each Investment Fund as of the date the benefit or charge is payable. The amount distributable or chargeable to the Account shall be equal to the number of Units distributed or charged from the Account multiplied by the Unit value determined as of the Accounting Date immediately preceding the date as of which the distribution or charge is payable. 
   
  10.8         Unit Value upon Transfer of Investment Funds 
  Participants, Alternate Payees and Beneficiaries electing to transfer from one Investment Fund to another under Plan section 9.2 shall, as of the Accounting Date of the transfer, have their Accounts in the Investment Fund from which the transfer is made charged and their Accounts in the Investment Fund to which the transfer is made credited, based upon the applicable Investment Fund Unit values in effect as of the Accounting Date. 
   
  10.9         Oxy Stock Fund Valuation 
  The balance of each Matching Account and, separately, any other portion of the Account invested in the Oxy Stock Fund shall be maintained in full and fractional Units. 
  All Oxy Stock acquired by the Oxy Stock Fund, including, but not by way of limitation, Oxy Stock contributed directly by the Employer or purchased with the contributions, Oxy Stock purchased with cash dividends paid in respect of Oxy Stock, Oxy Stock acquired from stock dividends and stock splits, and Oxy Stock purchased with the proceeds of the sale or exchange of warrants, rights or dividends in kind distributed in respect of Oxy Stock, shall be allocated to the Accounts based on the portion of the Account invested in the Oxy Stock Fund as of the Accounting Date in which the Oxy Stock is acquired. 
  For the purpose of valuing an Account in connection with any withdrawal or loan under the provisions of the Plan or for the purpose of any distribution in kind or partly in kind, shares of Oxy Stock shall be valued as of the Accounting Date of the withdrawal, loan, or distribution based on the closing quotation on the New York Stock Exchange on the Accounting Date in which such withdrawal, loan, or distribution is made; provided, however, that if shares of Oxy Stock are sold in connection with such a withdrawal, loan, or distribution, the shares sold shall be valued at the net proceeds received from such sale. If the closing price of such Oxy Stock shall not be so quoted or if so quoted shall not be available to the Administrative Committee, a composite index price or other price which shall be generally accepted for the establishment of fair market value shall be used for the purpose of so valuing the Account. 
  For the purpose of valuing an Account in connection with any transfer under the provisions of the Plan, shares of Oxy Stock shall be valued as of the effective date of the transfer based on the closing quotation on the New York Stock Exchange on the Accounting Date in which such transfer is made; provided, however, that if shares of Oxy Stock are sold in connection with such transfer, the shares sold shall be valued at the net proceeds received from such sale. If the closing price of such Oxy Stock shall not be so quoted or if so quoted shall not be available to the Administrative Committee, a composite index price or other price which shall be generally accepted for the establishment of fair market value shall be used for the purpose of so valuing the Account. 
   
  10.10         Value of Accounts 
  The value of the balance of any Account as of any Accounting Date shall equal: 
           (a) 
    The number of Units credited to the Account as of that date, including Units credited on that date pursuant to Plan section 10.6, multiplied by the Unit value determined as of the Accounting Date, plus 
              (b) 
    Any uninvested cash in the Account. 
      
  10.11         Cost Account 
  The Trustee shall maintain records so that the cost or  basis  (for tax purposes) of the Oxy Stock allocated to an Account may be determined as of any Accounting Date. Whenever shares of Oxy Stock are distributed from the Account, such shares shall be assigned a cost equal to the average cost of all shares allocated at the same time in accordance with rules and procedures adopted for the purpose by the Administrative Committee. 
   
  10.12         Rollover and Roth Rollover Contributions 
           (a) 
    Subject to the Administrative Committee s approval and in accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures adopted by the Administrative Committee, Active or Inactive Participants may contribute, under the conditions specified in this Plan section, to this Plan any of the amounts specified as Rollover Contributions or Roth Rollover Contributions. Rollover Contributions will be held in the Participant s Rollover Account.  Roth Rollover Contributions will be held in the Participant s Roth Rollover Account. 
              (b) 
    The amount must have been received by or on behalf of the Participant as an eligible rollover distribution, as defined in Code section 402(c)(4).  
              (1) 
    In the case of direct rollovers, the distribution must be received directly from: 
              (A) 
    A Qualified Plan; 
              (B) 
    A qualified plan described in Code section 403(a); 
              (C) 
    An annuity contract described in Code section 403(b);   
              (D) 
    An eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, a political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state; or 
              (E) 
    A Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A(b).  
              (2) 
    In the case of a rollover by the Participant, as opposed to a direct rollover, the Participant must have received the distribution no more than 60 days (unless the 60 day rollover deadline has been waived by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Code section 402(c)(3), or the Participant makes a written certification to the Plan that satisfies Section 3.02 of Revenue Procedure 2016-47) earlier from: 
              (A) 
    A plan described in paragraph (1), except that any Roth amounts must be received as a direct rollover, or  
              (B) 
    An individual retirement account or annuity described in Code section 408(a) or 408(b) that only includes amounts contributed to such account or annuity that had been rollover contributions from a plan described in paragraph (1). 
              (3) 
    On a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, the Administrative Committee or the Company may permit direct rollovers of promissory notes in connection with a loan under a Qualified Plan pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.401(a)(31) 1, Q A 16. The Administrative Committee may establish such reasonable procedures as it deems necessary to facilitate the direct rollover of the promissory notes and to ensure that after the rollover, each loan under the Plan complies with Code section 72(p), ERISA section 408(b)(1), and the regulations thereunder. By way of illustration and not limitation, the Administrative Committee may reamortize directly rolled over loans to accommodate repayment of the loans in conjunction with the payroll schedules of an Employer so as to comply with the maximum permitted term of the loan, or may require a Participant to execute such modification to an existing loan that is rolled over, as the Administrative Committee deems, in its sole discretion, necessary to comply with Code section 72(p), ERISA section 408(b)(1), or the regulations thereunder. 
              (c) 
    Before accepting an amount as a Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution, the Administrative Committee may require such information and documents it deems necessary or appropriate to establish that the contribution will satisfy the requirements of this Plan section and that receipt of the contribution will not adversely affect the qualified status of this Plan. To the extent deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrative Committee, such information may include copies of one or more of the following: IRS Form 1099, a distribution statement, the distribution check, certifications from the Participant, and statements from the administrator of the transferor plan that such plan had received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service.  
              (d) 
    Rollover and Roth Rollover Contributions, other than a promissory note evidencing a Participant loan that is rolled over, shall be invested in such Investment Funds as the Participant shall select, in accordance with such rules as are provided in Article 9, or in accordance with other procedures approved by the Administrative Committee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Rollover or Roth Rollover Contributions be invested in the Oxy Stock Fund. 
              (e) 
    If a Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution is made to this Plan and the Administrative Committee later determines that the contribution did not satisfy the requirements of this Plan section, then the Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution, plus any earnings attributable to the Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution, shall be distributed to the Participant, within a reasonable time after the Administrative Committee s determination. The Administrative Committee may use any reasonable method to determine the amount of earnings attributable to the Rollover or Roth Rollover Contribution. 
              (f) 
    The balance in a Participant s Rollover or Roth Rollover Account shall be distributed at the same time and in the same manner as other amounts in the Participant s Account.

  Article 11.         Financing 
   
  11.1         Trust Fund 
  The Company shall maintain a trust to finance the benefits under the Plan, by entering into one or more Trust Agreements or insurance contracts approved by the Company, or by causing insurance contracts to be held under a Trust Agreement.

A Trustee shall be appointed by the Board and shall have such powers as provided in the Trust Agreement. The Company may modify any Trust Agreement or insurance contract from time to time to accomplish the purposes of the Plan and may replace any insurance company or appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees. By entering into such Trust Agreements or insurance contracts, the Company shall vest in the Trustee, or in one or more investment managers (as defined under ERISA) appointed under the terms of the Trust Agreement from time to time by action of the Investment Committee, responsibility for the management and control of the Trust Fund. In the event the Investment Committee appoints any such investment manager, the Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of the investment manager or have any responsibility to invest or otherwise manage any portion of the Trust Fund subject to the management and control of the investment manager.

  11.2         Oxy Stock Fund 
           (a) 
    General Rules  . The Oxy Stock Fund shall consist of shares of Oxy Stock and cash or cash equivalents that are held pending investment in Oxy Stock. Investment in such shares shall be made from time to time by a direct issue of Oxy Stock from the Company or by purchase from securities dealers or by private purchase at such prices and in such amounts as the Trustee may determine in its absolute and complete discretion. However, no private purchase of such shares shall be made at a total cost greater than the total cost (including brokers  fees and other expenses of purchase) of purchasing such shares at the then prevailing price of such shares on the open market, such prevailing price to be determined by the Trustee as nearly as practicable based on the most recent public trading prices for the Oxy Stock. The Trustee may match purchases and sales to satisfy investment elections, withdrawals, loans and distributions of Participants. 
     The Trustee in its discretion may limit the daily volume of its purchases or sales of Oxy Stock to safeguard interest of Participants or comply with legal or exchange requirements. If the Trustee limits daily volume then the purchase prices or sale proceeds, as the case may be, during the period of volume limitations, shall be averaged, and the average per share price or sale proceeds shall be used in determining the cost or proceeds to be applied in satisfaction of any order of a Participant which requires the Trustee to purchase or sell Oxy Stock during such period. 
  All Oxy Stock purchased by the Trustee shall be registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee, and legal title to such Oxy Stock shall remain in the Trustee until the Participant shall become entitled to distribution thereof pursuant to this Plan. 
  The Trustee in its own discretion may invest funds awaiting investment in Oxy Stock in short term obligations, including obligations of the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, trust and participation certificates, beneficial interests in any trust, and such other short term obligations as the Trustee deems to be appropriate for such interim investment purposes. 
  In the event any option, right or warrant is received by the Trustee on Oxy Stock, the Trustee shall sell the same at public or private sale and at such price and upon such other terms as it may determine, unless the Investment Committee shall determine that such option, right or warrant should be exercised, in which case the Trustee shall exercise the same upon such terms and conditions as the Investment Committee may prescribe. 
           (b) 
    Election Restrictions for Officers  . Investment elections of Company officers shall be limited, if necessary, so that the beneficial interest in the Oxy Stock held by the Trust Fund for their Accounts shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 20 percent of the total value of all securities and other assets held by the Trust Fund in all Investment Funds. For purposes of this section, the term  officers  shall have the same meaning as set forth in Regulations section 240.3 b 2 promulgated pursuant to section 3(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
              (c) 
    Voting Rights  . Before each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the Company, and at such other times when shareholder action is required, the Trustee shall send to each Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee who has an investment in Oxy Stock through the Oxy Stock Fund, the proxy or consent solicitation materials that are sent to the Company s shareholders of record. Each such Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee shall have the right to instruct the Trustee confidentially as to the method of voting the shares of Oxy Stock allocated to the Account (through investment in the Oxy Stock Fund) as of the record date for determining the shares that are entitled to vote at the meeting of shareholders or that are entitled to give or withhold consent to corporate action. The Trustee in accordance with the instructions received from the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee shall vote such full and fractional shares of Oxy Stock. The Administrative Committee shall instruct the Trustee as to the method of voting shares of Oxy Stock for which timely voting instructions are not received from Participants, Beneficiaries or Alternate Payees. The Trustee shall not vote shares of Oxy Stock for which it does not receive voting instructions from Participants, Beneficiaries, Alternate Payees or the Administrative Committee. The Company shall ensure that the requisite voting forms, together with all information distributed to shareholders regarding the exercise of voting rights, are furnished to the Trustee and by the Trustee to such Participants, Beneficiaries and Alternate Payees within a reasonable time before such voting rights are to be exercised with respect to Oxy Stock held in the Oxy Stock Fund. 
              (d) 
    Distribution or Reinvestment of Cash Dividends  . In accordance with procedures set forth in this subsection, as implemented by the Administrative Committee, each Participant who is a Participant in the ESOP portion of this Plan may make the dividend pass through election described in this subsection with respect to dividends paid on or after June 1, 2002 on Oxy Stock held in the Oxy Stock Fund attributable to the Participant s Matching Account and with respect to dividends paid on or after July 19, 2007 on all Oxy Stock held in the Oxy Stock Fund. The dividends on which the dividend pass through election may be made are referred to as Eligible Dividends. Cash dividends that are not Eligible Dividends and cash proceeds from any other distribution received on Oxy Stock shall be invested in Oxy Stock. 
              (1) 
    Pass Through Election  . With respect to Eligible Dividends, the Participant may elect between: 
              (A) 
    Either: 
              (i) 
    The cash payment of Eligible Dividends directly to the Participant; except,  effective August 8, 2016, if the amount of Eligible Dividends is less than $10.00,  then the Eligible Dividends will be reinvested pursuant to Subsection (B) below; or 
              (ii) 
    If permitted by the Administrative Committee, the payment of Eligible Dividends to the Participant s Matching Account, Pretax Account, Roth Account, After-Tax Account, Rollover Account, Roth Rollover Account and In-Plan Roth Rollover Account (based on the subaccount from which the Eligible Dividend is derived) followed by the distribution of Eligible Dividends in cash to the Participant not later than 90 days after the close of the Plan Year in which the Eligible Dividends were paid by the Company; and 
              (B) 
    The payment of Eligible Dividends to the Participant s Matching Account, Pretax Account, Roth Account, After-Tax Account, Rollover Account, Roth Rollover Account and In-Plan Roth Rollover Account (based on the subaccount from which the Eligible Dividend is derived) and reinvestment in Oxy Stock through the Oxy Stock Fund. 
     If the Participant does not make an affirmative election, he shall be deemed to have elected the reinvestment of Eligible Dividends pursuant to subparagraph (B). Any earnings on Eligible Dividends shall not be distributed pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii), but any losses on such Eligible Dividends shall reduce the amount that can be distributed to the Participant under such provision. The Participant s election in effect on the ex dividend date for the Eligible Dividend shall control. A Participant may not split his election between subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) with respect to any single Eligible Dividend payment date. 
           (2) 
    Election Requirements  . The dividend pass through election shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
              (A) 
    A Participant must be given a reasonable opportunity before Eligible Dividends are paid or distributed in which to make the election. 
              (B) 
    A Participant must have a reasonable opportunity to change a dividend election at least annually. 
              (C) 
    If there is a change in the Plan terms governing the manner in which Eligible Dividends are paid or distributed, a Participant must be given a reasonable opportunity to make an election under the new Plan terms prior to the date on which the first Eligible Dividend subject to the new Plan terms is paid or distributed. 
              (D) 
    No election shall be applied retroactively; elections shall apply only to future dividend allocations. 
              (3) 
    Treatment of Eligible Dividends  . Eligible Dividends shall be treated as follows for purposes of the Plan: 
              (A) 
    A Participant shall at all times be fully vested in any Eligible Dividends with respect to which the Participant is offered a dividend pass through election. The Participant shall be fully vested regardless of whether the Eligible Dividends are paid in cash or reinvested in Oxy Stock allocated to the Participant s Account and regardless of whether the Participant is vested or nonvested in other amounts held in his Matching Account. 
              (B) 
    Eligible Dividends, whether paid in cash to the Participant or reinvested in the Plan, do not constitute an Annual Addition. In addition, reinvested Eligible Dividends do not constitute elective deferrals, within the meaning of Code section 402(g)(3), and shall not be treated as Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions or other elective deferrals, under the ADP Test, or After Tax Contributions, Adjustment Contributions or Matching Contributions under the ACP Test. 
              (C) 
    Eligible Dividends that are reinvested in Oxy Stock pursuant to a Participant s election under this subsection are treated as earnings in the same manner as dividends with respect to which a Participant is not provided a dividend pass through election. 
              (D) 
    Eligible Dividends paid in cash pursuant to a Participant s election under this subsection: 
              (i) 
    Are not subject to the consent requirements of Code section 411(a)(11) or the restrictions on the distributions of elective deferrals under Code section 401(k)(2)(B), notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary; and  
              (ii) 
    Do not constitute an Eligible Rollover Distribution (as determined under Plan section 7.7(b)(4)), even if the dividends are distributed at the same time as amounts that do constitute an Eligible Rollover Distribution. 
              (4) 
    Alternate Payees and Beneficiaries  . Subject to such rules as the Administrative Committee may prescribe, Alternate Payees and Beneficiaries shall be treated as Participants for purposes of this subsection. 
      
  11.3         Forfeitures 
  The Administrative Committee may use forfeitures occurring in any processing period to pay the reasonable costs of administering the Plan to the maximum extent permitted by ERISA or to reduce Matching Contributions of all Employers without regard to whether the forfeitures are attributable to persons employed by any individual Employer for such processing period or future processing periods.  If the amount of allocable forfeitures occurring in a processing period exceeds the amount of Employer contributions for such processing period, then the excess shall be deposited in a separate account.  Effective December 1, 2016, or as soon as practicable thereafter but in no event later than December 31, 2016, such amounts will be deposited into a separate  Forfeiture Account,  invested in the Stable Value Fund, defined in Appendix B(a) of the Plan, or such other fund as determined within the discretion of the Administrative Committee, and such amounts will be considered Plan assets and allocated in lieu of Employer contributions in succeeding pay periods or used to pay the reasonable expenses of administering the Plan.  If the Plan terminates while a balance in the Forfeiture Account exists, the balance shall be allocated to Participants per capita to the extent of the maximum amount permitted under Plan section 6.6.  Forfeitures shall be used before the end of the Plan Year in which the forfeitures occurred to the extent administratively feasible. 
   
  11.4         Non Reversion 
  Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible at any time for the contributions of the Employer or any part of the Trust Fund to revert to the Company or an Affiliate or to be used for or diverted to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of Participants or their Beneficiaries, except that: 
           (a) 
    If a contribution or portion thereof is made by the Employer by a mistake of fact, upon written request to the Administrative Committee, such contribution or such portion, reduced by losses but not increased by earnings, shall be returned to the Employer within one year after the date of payment; and 
              (b) 
    In the event that a deduction for any contributions made by the Employer is disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service in any Plan Year, then that portion of the Employer contribution that is not deductible shall be returned to the Employer within one year from the date of receipt of notice by the Internal Revenue Service of the disallowance of the deduction. 
      
  11.5         Direct Transfer of Assets from Plans of Acquired Entities 
  The Trust Agreement shall permit the direct receipt of assets which are transferred directly to the Trust Fund from the trustees of any other Qualified Plan sponsored, at the time of the applicable transaction, by entities which are the subject of purchase transactions made by the Company or an Affiliate. 
   
  11.6         California Resources Corporation Stock Fund 
           (a)

No new investment in such shares shall be made on or after December 2, 2014, except any stock dividend paid by California Resources Corporation that may be reinvested in this Fund. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the provisions of this Plan section 11.6 shall govern the disposition of dividends paid on CRC Stock.  Effective December 1, 2016, any investment remaining in the California Resources Corporation Stock Fund shall be transferred to the fund determined by the Investment Committee and communicated to Participants, and the CRC Stock Fund will no longer be offered as an Investment Fund under the Plan. 
              (b) 
    Voting Rights  . Before each annual or special meeting of the shareholders of the California Resources Corporation, and at such other times when shareholder action is required, the Trustee shall send to each Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee who has an investment in California Resources Corporation Stock through the California Resources Corporation Stock Fund, the proxy or consent solicitation materials that are sent to the California Resources Corporation s shareholders of record. Each such Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee shall have the right to instruct the Trustee confidentially as to the method of voting the shares of California Resources Corporation Stock allocated to the Account (through investment in the California Resources Corporation Stock Fund) as of the record date for determining the shares that are entitled to vote at the meeting of shareholders or that are entitled to give or withhold consent to corporate action. The Trustee in accordance with the instructions received from the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee shall vote such shares of California Resources Corporation Stock. The Administrative Committee shall instruct the Trustee as to the method of voting shares of California Resources Corporation Stock for which timely voting instructions are not received from Participants, Beneficiaries or Alternate Payees. The Trustee shall not vote shares of California Resources Corporation Stock for which it does not receive voting instructions from Participants, Beneficiaries, Alternate Payees or the Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee shall ensure that the requisite voting forms, together with all information distributed to shareholders regarding the exercise of voting rights, are furnished to the Trustee and by the Trustee to such Participants, Beneficiaries and Alternate Payees within a reasonable time before such voting rights are to be exercised with respect to California Resources Corporation Stock held in the California Resources Corporation Stock Fund. 
      
  11.7         Pension Expense Reimbursement Account ( PERA ) 
  Effective on or after August 8, 2016, the Administrative Committee in its discretion may decide to use revenue sharing payments (  i.e.  , float income earned on uninvested cash and all other revenue, if any, received from the investments in the Plan (other than operating expenses paid by mutual fund shareholders generally, whether via rebates or otherwise, that are reflected in the net asset values of such mutual fund shares)) for approved ERISA expenses.  Effective December 1, 2016, or as soon as practicable thereafter but in no event later than December 31, 2016, such amounts as well as Participant-paid fees (including loan initiation fees) and Plan-imposed excessive trading fees will be deposited into a separate  ERISA Account,  invested in the Stable Value Fund, defined in Appendix B(a) of the Plan, or such other fund as determined within the discretion of the Administrative Committee, and such amounts will be considered Plan assets.  Amounts in the ERISA Account must be used for the direct benefit of Plan Participants, and any balances remaining in the ERISA Account at year end must be used by the end of the first quarter of the next Plan Year.  Alternatively, the year-end balance must be allocated to Participant Accounts after this deadline.  Approved ERISA expenses will include those reasonable, necessary and direct expenses incurred by the Plan for services provided by the Plan s Trustee, recordkeeper or other service providers.

    Each Employee or member of the Board who has responsibility (whether by delegation from another person, an allocation of responsibilities under the terms of this Plan document, or otherwise) for a fiduciary duty, a nonfiduciary settlor function (such as deciding whether to approve a plan amendment), or a nonfiduciary administrative task relating to the Plan. 
              (b) 
    The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees and court costs, incurred by that person on account of his good faith actions or failures to act with respect to his responsibilities relating to the Plan. The Company s indemnification shall include payment of any amounts due under a settlement of any lawsuit or investigation, but only if the Company agrees to the settlement. 
              (1) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section only if he notifies an Appropriate Person at the Company of any claim asserted against or any investigation of the Indemnified Person that relates to the Indemnified Person s responsibilities with respect to the Plan. 
              (A) 
    A person is an  Appropriate Person  to receive notice of the claim or investigation if a reasonable person would believe that the person notified would initiate action to protect the interests of the Company in response to the Indemnified Person s notice. 
              (B) 
    The notice may be provided orally or in writing. The notice must be provided to the Appropriate Person promptly after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the claim or investigation. No indemnification shall be provided under this section to the extent that the Plan or Company is materially prejudiced by the unreasonable delay of the Indemnified Person in notifying an Appropriate Person of the claim or investigation. 
              (2) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to attorneys  fees, court costs or other litigation expenses or any settlement of such litigation only if the Indemnified Person agrees to permit the Company to select counsel and to conduct the defense of the lawsuit and agrees not to take any action in the lawsuit that the Company believes would be prejudicial to the interests of the Company. 
              (3) 
    No Indemnified Person, including an Indemnified Person who had a Separation from Service, shall be indemnified under this section unless he makes himself reasonably available to assist the Company with respect to the matters in issue and agrees to provide whatever documents, testimony, information, materials, or other forms of assistance that the Company shall reasonably request. 
              (4) 
    No Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to any action or failure to act that is judicially determined to constitute or be attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Person. 
              (5) 
    Payments of any indemnity under this section shall be made only from the assets of the Company and shall not be made directly or indirectly from assets of the Plan. The provisions of this section shall not preclude such further indemnities as may be available under insurance purchased by the Company or as may be provided by the Company under any by law, agreement or otherwise, provided that no expense shall be indemnified under this section that is otherwise indemnified by an insurance contract purchased by the Company. 
      
  12.13         Fiduciaries 
  The fiduciaries named in this Article shall have only those specific powers, duties, responsibilities, and obligations as are specifically given them under this Plan or the Trust or otherwise delegated by the Board. The Employers shall have the sole responsibility for making the contributions required under Article 4 and Article 5, and the Company shall have the sole authority to appoint and remove the Trustee and to amend or terminate, in whole or in part, this Plan or the Trust. The Administrative Committee shall have the sole responsibility for the administration of this Plan, which responsibility is specifically described in this Plan and the Trust Agreement or otherwise delegated by the Board. The officers and Employees of the Company shall have the responsibility of implementing the Plan and carrying out its provisions as the Administrative Committee shall direct. The Investment Committee, the Trustee, and any investment manager shall have the sole responsibility for the administration of the Trust Fund and the management of the assets held under the Trust Fund, to the extent provided in the Trust Agreement. A fiduciary may rely upon any direction, information, or action of another fiduciary as being proper under this Plan or the Trust Agreement, and is not required under this Plan or the Trust Agreement to inquire into the propriety of any such direction, information, or action. It is intended under this Plan and the Trust Agreement that each fiduciary shall be responsible for the proper exercise of his or its own powers, duties, responsibilities, and obligations under this Plan and the Trust Agreement and shall not be responsible for any act or failure to act of another fiduciary. No fiduciary guarantees the Trust Fund in any manner against investment loss or depreciation in asset value. Any party may serve in more than one fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan or Trust Agreement. 
  Whether or not a particular activity performed by the Administrative Committee, Investment Committee, a Committee member, or delegate is considered to rise to the level of a fiduciary duty shall depend on whether the person or entity is, when performing the activity, exercising the discretion with respect to the administration of the Plan, which under ERISA, if applicable, requires a fiduciary standard of conduct.  In the absence of an activity involving such an exercise of discretion with respect to the Plan s administration, the activity shall be considered ministerial, rather than fiduciary, in nature.  If and when a Committee member or delegate is performing a  settlor  activity, under ERISA, including, by way of example, the adoption of an amendment to or decision to establish or terminate a plan, then such activity shall be deemed to be an exercise of  settlor  or sponsor responsibility and shall be subject to ordinary business judgment and not an exercise of fiduciary duty.  The Administrative Committee and Investment Committee will not be subject to fiduciary liability or standards for any settlor or non-fiduciary responsibilities and/or duties delegated to it by the Board. 

12.14         Notice of Address 
  Each person entitled to benefits from the Plan must file with the Administrative Committee or its agent, in writing, his post office address and each change of post office address. Any communication, statement, or notice addressed to such a person at his latest reported post office address will be binding upon him for all purposes of the Plan, and neither the Administrative Committee nor the Company or any Trustee shall be obliged to search for or ascertain his whereabouts. 
   
  12.15         Data 
  All persons entitled to benefits from the Plan must furnish to the Company such documents, evidence, or information, including information concerning marital status, as the Company considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the Plan; and it shall be a condition of the Plan that each such person must furnish such information and sign such documents as the Company may require before any benefits become payable from the Plan. The Administrative Committee shall be entitled to distribute benefits to a non Spouse beneficiary in reliance upon the signed statement of the Participant that he is unmarried without any further liability to a Spouse if such statement is false. 
   
  12.16         Benefit Claims Procedures 
  The provisions of this section shall be subject to, and shall apply to, the extent required under Department of Labor Regulations section 2560.503 1 (relating to the requirements of claims procedures). All decisions made under the procedures described in this section shall be final and there shall be no further right of appeal. No lawsuit may be initiated by any person before fully pursuing the procedures set out in this section, including the appeal permitted pursuant to subsection (d). 
           (a) 
    The right of a Participant, Beneficiary, Alternate Payee, or any other person entitled to claim a benefit under the Plan shall be determined by the Administrative Committee, provided, however, that the Administrative Committee may delegate its responsibility to any person. All persons entitled to claim a benefit under the Plan shall be referred to as a  Claimant  for purpose of this section. The term  Claimant  shall also include, where appropriate to the context, any person authorized to represent the Claimant under procedures established by the Administrative Committee. 
              (1) 
    The Claimant may file a claim for benefits by written notice to the Administrative Committee. 
              (2) 
    Any claim for benefits under the Plan, pursuant to this section, shall be filed with the Administrative Committee no later than eighteen months after the date that a transaction occurred, or should have occurred, with respect to a Claimant s Account (  e.g.,   two years after benefits were credited, or should have been credited, to a Claimant s Account, or eighteen months after any withdrawal or distribution occurred or should have occurred). The Administrative Committee in its sole discretion shall determine whether this limitation period has been exceeded. 
              (3) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the following shall not be a claim for purposes of this section: 
              (A) 
    A request for determination of eligibility, enrollment, or participation under the Plan without an accompanying claim for benefits under the Plan. The determination of eligibility, enrollment, or participation under the Plan may be necessary to resolve a claim, in which case such determination shall be made in accordance with the claims procedures set forth in this section. 
              (B) 
    Any casual inquiry relating to the Plan, including an inquiry about benefits or the circumstances under which benefits might be paid under the Plan. 
              (C) 
    A claim that is defective or otherwise fails to follow the procedures of the Plan (  e.g.  , a claim that is addressed to a party, other than the Administrative Committee, or an oral claim). 
              (D) 
    An application or request for benefits under the Plan. 
              (b) 
    If a claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied, the Administrative Committee shall, within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 90 days after receipt of the claim (or 45 days after receipt of the claim in the case of a disability claim), notify the Claimant of the denial of benefits. In the case of a claim other than a disability claim, if special circumstances justify extending the period up to an additional 90 days, the Claimant shall be given written notice of this extension within the initial 90 day period, and such notice shall set forth the special circumstances and the date on which a decision is expected. In the case of a disability claim, the Administrative Committee may give the Claimant written notice before the end of the initial 45 period that it needs an additional 30 days to review the claim, provided that such notice shall set forth the circumstances beyond the control of the Administrative Committee justifying extending the period and the date on which a decision is expected. If special circumstances beyond the control of the Administrative Committee s control justify extending the claim review period for an additional 30 days, the Claimant shall be provided written notice of this extension within the first 30-day period. 
              (c) 
    A notice of denial: 
              (1) 
    Shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant; and 
              (2) 
    Shall contain: 
              (A) 
    The specific reasons for denial of the claim; 
              (B) 
    Specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based; 
              (C) 
    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim, along with an explanation as to why such material or information is necessary; and 
              (D) 
    An explanation of the Plan s claim review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse determination on review. 
              (d) 
    Within 60 days of the receipt by the Claimant of the written denial of his or her claim (or within 180 days of receipt in the case of a disability claim) or, if the claim has not been granted, within a reasonable period of time (which shall not be less than the applicable time period specified in subsection (b)), the Claimant may file a written request with the Administrative Committee that it conduct a full review of the denial of the claim. In connection with the Claimant s appeal, upon request, the Claimant may review and obtain copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits, but not including any document, record or information that is subject to any attorney client or work product privilege or whose disclosure would violate the privacy rights or expectations of any person other than the Claimant. The Claimant may submit issues and comments in writing and may submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. All comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant shall be taken into account in the appeal without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 
              (e) 
    The Administrative Committee shall deliver to the Claimant a written decision on the claim promptly, but no later than 60 days (or 45 days in the case of a disability claim) after the receipt of the Claimant s request for such review, unless special circumstances exist that justify extending this period up to an additional 60 days (or 45 days in the case of a disability claim). If the period is extended, the Claimant shall be given written notice of this extension during the initial 60 day period (or 45-day period in the case of a disability claim) and such notice shall set forth the special circumstances and the date a decision is expected. The decision on review of the denial of the claim: 
              (1) 
    Shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant; 
              (2) 
    Shall include specific reasons for the decision; 
              (3) 
    Shall contain specific references to the Plan provisions on which the decision is based; 
              (4) 
    Shall contain a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits; and 
              (5) 
    Shall contain a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA section 502(a) following an adverse determination on review. 
              (f) 
    No legal action may be commenced after the later of: 
              (1) 
    180 days after receiving the written response of the Administrative Committee to an appeal, or  
              (2) 
    365 days after the Claimant s original application for benefits. 
      
  12.17         Member s Own Participation 
  No member of the Administrative Committee or the Investment Committee may act, vote or otherwise influence a decision of the committee on which he or she serves specifically relating to his or her own participation under the Plan. 
   
  Article 13.         Amendment and Termination 
   
  13.1         Amendment and Termination 
  The Company expects the Plan to be permanent and to continue indefinitely; however, this Plan is purely voluntary on the part of the Company and each Employer. The Company must necessarily and does hereby reserve the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time by action of its Board. The Administrative Committee in its discretion may amend the Plan if it finds that such amendment does not significantly decrease benefits or significantly increase costs or it determines that the amendment is required to comply with applicable law.  
  No amendment of the Plan shall cause any part of the Trust Fund to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries covered by the Plan, or increase the duties and responsibilities of the Trustee without its consent, or decrease any Account balance. 
   
  13.2         Distribution on Termination 
  Upon termination of the Plan in whole or in part, or upon complete discontinuance of contributions to the Plan by the Company, the value of the proportionate interest in the Trust Fund of each Participant affected by such termination shall be determined by the Administrative Committee as of the date of such termination or discontinuance. The Accounts of such Participants shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable, and thereafter distribution shall be made to such Participants as directed by the Administrative Committee. 
  Upon the partial termination of the Plan, the Board may in its sole discretion determine the timing of a distribution of the balance of the affected Participants  Accounts. 
   
  13.3         Successors 
  In case of the merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of an Employer, or the sale by an Employer of all or substantially all of its assets, provision may be made by written agreement between the Company and any successor corporation acquiring or receiving a substantial part of the Employer s assets, whereby the Plan and the Trust Agreement will be continued by the successor. If the Plan is to be continued by the successor, then effective as of the date of the reorganization or transfer, the successor corporation shall be substituted for the Employer under the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The substitution of a successor corporation for an Employer will not in any way be considered a termination of the Plan. 
   
  13.4         Plan Merger or Transfer 
  This Plan shall not merge or consolidate with, or transfer assets and liabilities to, or accept a transfer from, any other employee benefit plan unless each Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee in this Plan will (if the Plan had then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is not less than the benefit the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer of assets (if this Plan had then terminated). Subject to these limitations, the Plan may transfer assets and liabilities to, or accept a transfer of assets and liabilities from, any other employee benefit plan which is qualified under Code section 401(a) where such a transfer has been authorized by agreement between the Company and the sponsor of the other employee benefit plan and is not prohibited by law. 
   
  Article 14.         Participating Affiliates 
   
  14.1         Adoption of the Plan 
  The Board or, if authorized by the Board, the Administrative Committee may designate any Affiliate as an Employer under this Plan. The Affiliate shall become an Employer and a party to this Plan and the Trust Agreement upon acceptance of such designation effective as of the date specified by the Board or Administrative Committee. 
   
  14.2         Conditions of Participation 
  By accepting such designation or continuing as a party to the Plan and Trust, each Employer acknowledges that: 
           (a) 
    It is bound by such terms and conditions relating to the Plan as the Company or the Administrative Committee may reasonably require; 
              (b) 
    It must comply with all qualification requirements and employee benefit rules of the Code, ERISA and related regulations and hereby acknowledges the authority of the Company, the Administrative Committee, and the Investment Committee to review the Affiliate s compliance procedures and to require changes in such procedures to protect the Plan s qualification; 
              (c) 
    It has authorized the Company, the Administrative Committee, and the Investment Committee to act on its behalf with respect to Employer matters pertaining to the Plan and the Trust Fund; 
              (d) 
    It will cooperate fully with the Plan officials and their agents by providing such information and taking such other actions, as they deem appropriate for the efficient administration of the Plan and the Trust Fund; and 
              (e) 
    Its status as an Employer under the Plan is expressly conditioned on its being and continuing to be an Affiliate of the Company. 
      
  14.3         Termination of Participation 
           (a) 
    Withdrawal by Affiliate  . Subject to the concurrence of the Board or Administrative Committee, any Affiliate may withdraw from the Plan and Trust, and end its status as an Employer hereunder, by communicating in writing to the Administrative Committee its desire to withdraw. The withdrawal shall be effective as of the date agreed to by the Board or Administrative Committee, as the case may be, and the Affiliate. Upon such withdrawal, the Plan shall not terminate. 
              (b) 
    Termination by Company  . The Company, acting through the Board or, if authorized by the Board, the Administrative Committee, reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at any time, to terminate the participation in this Plan of any Employer. Such termination shall be effective immediately, upon the notice of such termination from the Company to the Trustee and the Employer being terminated, whichever occurs first, or such later effective date agreed to by the Company. Upon such termination, this Plan shall not terminate. 
      
  14.4         Consequences of the Termination of an Employer 
  If an Employer ceases to participate in this Plan, for whatever reason, and the Plan is not terminated then, unless otherwise directed by the Board, the Administrative Committee shall elect, in its discretion, which of the following shall apply: 
           (a) 
    The Administrative Committee may elect that the portion of the Plan attributable to the former Employer shall become a separate plan effective as of the date on which the Employer s participation in this Plan terminates. The Administrative Committee shall inform the Trustee of the portion of the Trust Fund that is attributable to the participation of the terminated Employer. As soon thereafter as is administratively feasible, the Trustee shall set apart that portion of the Trust Fund as a separate trust fund that shall be part of the separate plan of the terminated Employer. Thereafter, the administration, control, and operation of the separate plan, with respect to the terminated Employer, shall be on a separate basis, in accordance with the terms of this Plan except that: 
              (1) 
    The terminated Employer, not the Company or the Administrative Committee, shall be the sponsor and administrator of the separate plan and shall have all duties, responsibilities, and powers that the Company, Administrative Committee and Investment Committee have under this Plan; and 
              (2) 
    The terminated Employer, not the Company, shall have the power to amend and terminate the separate plan, in accordance with the provisions of Plan section 13.1. 
              (b) 
    Alternatively, the Administrative Committee may elect to maintain the Accounts of Participants employed by the terminated Employer as follows: 
              (1) 
    Except as provided in paragraph (5), all Participants employed by the terminated Employer on the date on which the entity ceases participation in this Plan shall become Inactive Participants or Former Participants, as applicable. 
              (2) 
    The Pretax Deferral, Roth Contribution, Catch Up Contribution and After Tax Contribution elections of an Active Participant under Article 4 shall only apply to Earnings for the portion of the Plan Year ending on the Employer s termination date. 
              (3) 
    The terminated Employer shall transfer to the Trust Fund the Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, Catch Up Contributions, Matching Contributions and After Tax Contributions required under the Plan relating to Earnings through the effective date of the Employer s termination of participation in this Plan. 
              (4) 
    For purposes of being eligible to receive a distribution of his or her Account, an Inactive Participant described in paragraph (1) shall not be treated as having a Separation from Service unless and until the Administrative Committee determines that the Participant is eligible to receive a distribution under the provisions of Code section 401(k)(2)(B)(i). 
              (5) 
    If a Participant described in paragraph (1) becomes an Employee of another Employer immediately after the effective date of the prior Employer s termination of participation in this Plan, then the Participant shall be treated under the Plan as having transferred employment from one Employer to another. 
              (c) 
    With the consent of the Employer that is no longer participating in the Plan, the Company or Administrative Committee may take such other actions with respect to the Accounts of Participants employed by that Employer as are permitted under the Code and ERISA.

  Article 16.         Miscellaneous Provisions 
   
  16.1         No Enlargement of Employment Rights 
  This Plan is strictly a voluntary undertaking on the part of the Company and the Employers and shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Employers and any Employee or Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee, or to be consideration for, or an inducement to, or a condition of, the employment of any Employee. Nothing contained in this Plan or any modification of the same or act done in pursuance hereof shall be construed as giving any person any legal or equitable right against the Employer, the Trustee, or the Trust Fund, unless specifically provided herein, or as giving any person a right to be retained in the employ of the Employer. All Participants shall remain subject to assignment, reassignment, promotion, transfer, layoff, reduction, suspension, and discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had never been established. No Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee, before satisfying all conditions for receiving benefits, shall have any right or interest in or to any portion of the Trust Fund. No one shall have any right to benefits, except to the extent provided in this Plan. 
   
  16.2         No Examination or Accounting 
  Neither this Plan nor any action taken thereunder shall be construed as giving any person the right to an accounting or to examine the books or affairs of the Company or any Affiliate. 
   
  16.3         Investment Risk 
  The Participants and their Beneficiaries shall assume all risks in connection with any decrease in the value of any assets or funds which may be invested or reinvested in the Trust Fund which supports this Plan. 
   
  16.4         Non Alienation 
           (a) 
    Except as otherwise permitted by the Plan, no benefit payable at any time under the Plan shall be subject to the debts or liabilities of a Participant or his or her Beneficiary. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or otherwise encumber any such benefit, whether presently or thereafter payable, shall be void. Except as provided in this section, no benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to attachment, garnishment, or encumbrance of any kind. 
              (b) 
    Payment may be made from a Participant s Account to an Alternate Payee, pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. 
              (1) 
    The Administrative Committee shall establish reasonable written procedures for reviewing court orders made, pursuant to state domestic relations law (including a community property law), relating to child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights of a Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant and for notifying Participants and Alternate Payees of the receipt of such orders and of the Plan s procedures for determining if the orders are Qualified Domestic Relations Orders and for administering distributions under Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. 
              (2) 
    Except as may otherwise be required by applicable law, such Qualified Domestic Relations Orders may not require a retroactive transfer of all or part of a Participant s Account to or for the benefit of an Alternate Payee without permitting an appropriate adjustment for earnings and investment gains or losses that have occurred in the interim, nor shall such orders require the Plan to provide rights to Alternate Payees that are not available to Beneficiaries generally. 
              (3) 
    In cases in which a full and prompt payment of amounts assigned to an Alternate Payee will not be made, pursuant to this subsection, the assigned amounts will be transferred, within a reasonable time after determination that the order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, to a separate Account for the benefit of the Alternate Payee and invested in accordance with the Alternate Payee s investment elections pursuant to Article 9. 
              (4) 
    No amount that is segregated pending a determination of whether a domestic relations order is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order or transferred to a separate Account for the benefit of the Alternative Payee shall be taken into account when determining the amount that: 
              (A) 
    A Participant may withdraw from his or her Account, pursuant to Plan section 7.2; 
              (B) 
    A Participant may receive in a Plan loan, pursuant to Plan section 8.2; or 
              (C)

              (c) 
    Payment may be made from an Account, to the extent required by a federal tax levy made pursuant to Code section 6331 or by the United States  collection of a judgment resulting from an unpaid federal tax assessment. Payment may be made at the time required by the tax levy or judgment collection order, even if payment would not otherwise be made at that time under the terms of the Plan and payment from the Plan would not otherwise be permitted at that time under Code section 401(a), 401(k), or 411(a)(11). 
              (d) 
    Payments from an Account may be offset to the extent permitted under Code section 401(a)(13)(C) (relating to offsets regarding breaches of duty with respect to the Plan). 
              (e) 
    A Participant or Beneficiary may disclaim his or her Account, or a portion thereof, subject to the rules which may be modified from time to time by the Administrative Committee. 
      
  16.5         Incompetency 
  Every person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the date on which the Administrative Committee receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrative Committee, that such person is incompetent or a minor, for whom a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his or her person or estate has been appointed; provided, however, that if the Administrative Committee shall find that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of incompetency, or is a minor, any payment due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the Spouse, a child, a parent, a brother or sister, or to any person or institution deemed by the Administrative Committee to have incurred expenses for such person otherwise entitled to payment. To the extent permitted by law, any such payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefore under the Plan. In the event that a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and proper proof of appointment and continuing qualification is furnished in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrative Committee, then, to the extent permitted by law, 
           (a) 
    Such guardian may act for the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee and make any election required of or permitted by the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee under this Plan, and such action or election shall be deemed to have been taken by the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee; and 
              (b) 
    Benefit payments may be made to such guardian, and any such payment so made shall be a complete discharge of any liability therefore under the Plan. 
      
  16.6         Records Conclusive 
  The records of the Company, Employers, the Administrative Committee, the Investment Committee and the Trustee shall be conclusive in respect to all matters involved in the administration of the Plan.

  The Trustee, the members of the Administrative Committee, and the Secretary of the Company are hereby designated agents of the Plan for the purpose of receiving service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process. 
   
  16.9         Uncashed or Unclaimed Benefits 
           (a) 
    Stale Checks.  Effective on or after August 8, 2016, if a distribution check is issued under the Plan and such distribution check is not cashed within 6 months after issuance, the check will be characterized as stale, and the funds re-deposited into a special account under the Plan.  Such funds shall be characterized on an after-tax basis and effective December 1, 2016, or as soon as practicable thereafter but in no event later than December 31, 2016, such amounts will be invested in the Plan s Stable Value Fund, defined in Appendix B(a) of the Plan, or such other fund as determined within the discretion of the Administrative Committee.  The check will be reissued upon request by the Participant pursuant to procedures established by the Administrative Committee.   
              (b) 
    Lost Participants.  In the event that the Administrative Committee, after having made a diligent search, is unable to locate a Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee who is entitled to benefits under this Plan, such benefits shall be treated as a forfeiture under Plan section 3.6. In the event that the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee whose Account is subject to such forfeiture subsequently asserts a valid claim for benefits, the Account will be restored in the manner described in Plan section 3.6. 
      
  16.10         Qualified Military Service 
  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and Service credit required with respect to qualified military service, within the meaning of Code section 414(u), will be provided in accordance with the mandatory provisions of Code section 414(u). In addition, in compliance with the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act ( HEART), the following provisions shall apply notwithstanding any Plan provision to the contrary: 
           (a) 
    Effective January 1, 2007, if the Participant dies while on qualified military service, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be entitled to any benefit under the Plan (other than additional allocations related to the period of qualified military service) to the same extent that the Participant would have been entitled to such benefit had the Participant resumed employment and then incurred a Separation from Service on account of death. 
              (b) 
    Effective January 1, 2009, Differential Wages shall be treated as Base Pay, as provided in Plan section 2.1(p)(2)(H), and Section 415 Compensation, as provided in Plan section 2.1(nnn)(2)(D), paid to an Active Participant by the Employer making the payment. For this purpose, Differential Wages means any payment made by an Employer with respect to any period during which the Employee is performing qualified military service and represents all or a portion of the wages the Employee would have received from the Employer if the Employee were performing service for the Employer. 
              (c) 
    Effective January 1, 2009 and even if the Employee is receiving Differential Wages, a Participant performing qualified military service will be treated as having incurred a Separation from Service during the period of such qualified military service for purposes of Plan section 7.3, but only with respect to the Participant s Pretax Account and Roth Account. If the Participant elects to receive a distribution under this deemed Separation from Service, then such Participant shall not be permitted to make Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions or After Tax Contributions during the six month period beginning on the date of the distribution.  Effective for withdrawals requested after August 8, 2016, if a Participant is suspended from making any Pretax Deferrals, Roth Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions and/or After Tax Contributions in accordance with the sentence above, such contributions will be automatically reinstated upon expiration of the six-month suspension period at the Default Percentage, as applicable, or if the Participant was not subject to automatic enrollment or had opted out of automatic enrollment at the percentage in place prior to the suspension.

Effective December 31, 2006, for each Participant making a Special Transition Rule Election under Section 5.12, the Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was merged with the Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the 2005 DCP, the Savings Plan Restoration Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was merged with the Savings Plan Restoration Account (if any) of such Participant under the 2005 DCP, the SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) of such Participant under the DCP2 was transferred to the 2005 DCP, and all such accounts are governed by the terms of this Plan.  For Participants not making such an election, any Deferral Account, Savings Plan Restoration Account, or SEDCP Deferral Account of such Participant under the DCP2 or 2005 DCP is subject to the terms of this Plan but maintained separate from each other.  The Plan was amended and restated effective November 1, 2008.

  1.4          PARTICIPATION 
  1.5        Election to Participate  .   
  (a)        Deferral Elections  .  An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan and elect to defer annual Base Salary and/or Bonus under the Plan by filing with the Committee a completed and fully executed Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of the Plan Year during which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which such Base Salary and Bonus are to be earned, or at such other time as the Committee may permit in accordance  
  
   8 
    
  2180844.5 

with the regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A  .    Deferral Election Forms must be filed in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Forms.   
  Prior to December 1, 2016, an employee who first becomes an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year may make an initial deferral election under this Plan within 30 days after the date the employee becomes an Eligible Employee provided that such Eligible Employee has not previously become eligible to participate in any other account balance plan that is required to be aggregated with this Plan as described in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(c)(2) (or any successor provision).  Any such election shall apply to Base Salary earned for services performed after the 30-day election window described in the previous sentence and to that portion of the Bonus earned during such Plan Year equal to the total amount of the Bonus multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the Plan Year after the 30-day election window described in the previous sentence ends over the total number of days in the Plan Year.  Effective December 1, 2016, Eligible Employees may no longer make initial deferral elections pursuant to the rule in this paragraph.  As of that date, Eligible Employees may only commence or resume participation in the Plan on January 1 of a Plan Year, which shall require the filing of a Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of such Plan Year as provided in the first paragraph of this Section 4.1.      
    
  A Deferral Election Form filed for a Plan Year shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year only.  For each subsequent Plan Year, an Eligible Employee who wishes to defer Base Salary and/or Bonus must file a new complete and fully executed Deferral Election Form in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Form but in any event prior to January 1 of such Plan Year.   
    
  Each Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant.  Deferrals of Base Salary will normally be deducted ratably during the Plan Year, except as otherwise determined by the Committee to take into account special circumstances; provided that in no event will the Committee s action alter the total amount of Deferrals for the Plan Year.  In its sole discretion, the Committee may also permit amounts that an Eligible Employee has previously elected to defer under other plans or agreements with the Company to be transferred to this Plan and credited to his Deferral Accounts that are maintained hereunder, provided that no change shall be made in the time or form of payment of such transferred amounts except as may be permitted by Code Section 409A. 
    
  (A)      Minimum Deferral  .  For each Plan Year, the minimum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is $5,000, if expressed as a dollar amount, or 5% of Base Salary, if expressed as a percentage, and the minimum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is any of the following:  (I) $5,000, (II) 5% of Bonus, or (III) 100% of that portion of any Bonus that exceeds a dollar amount specified by the Participant on his Deferral Election Form. 
    
  (B)      Maximum Deferral  .  For each Plan Year, the maximum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is 75% of Base Salary, and the maximum  
  
   9 
    
  2180844.5 

amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is 90% of Bonus.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective with respect to amounts earned on or after January 1, 2007, for each Plan Year, the maximum total amount of Compensation     that a Participant may elect to defer is $75,000.  For the 2007 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply only to deferrals of Base Salary that would otherwise have been paid in 2007.  For the 2008 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply to the deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2007, and otherwise paid in 2008.  For the 2008 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall also apply to deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2008, and otherwise paid in 2009.  For the 2009 and all future Plan Years, the $75,000 limit shall apply to amounts of Base Salary and Bonus earned in any one Plan Year.  For example, in Plan Year 2009, the $75,000 limit shall first apply to deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2009 and then to deferrals of Bonus that are earned in 2009 and would otherwise be payable in 2010. 
       
  (C)      Deferral Account Balance  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s total Deferral Account balance is $1,000,000 or more, then the Participant may not defer any compensation earned in the following Plan Year and any election to do so shall be considered void.  If as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s total Deferral Account balance is less than $1,000,000, then the Participant may defer compensation earned in the following Plan Year in accordance with this Article IV.  For purposes of this provision, a Participant s Deferral Account balance shall exclude the balance in the Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account, if any. 
    
  (b)        Early Payment Benefit Election  .  With respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus earned after December 31, 2007, on the Deferral Election Form filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a), an Eligible Employee may irrevocably elect to receive all or a portion of the Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to that election in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over two (2) to five (5) years commencing prior to Separation from Service in an Early Payment Year.  If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum.  The Early Payment Year elected must be a year that begins at least two (2) years after the end of each Plan Year to which the election applies.  An Early Payment Benefit election filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2008, or for any subsequent Plan Year, shall be effective for the deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus earned during that Plan Year.  A Participant may make an election for an Early Payment Benefit with respect to deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus earned in any future Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year.  A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of an Early Payment Benefit with respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a).   
  A Participant may not at any time have Early Payment Benefits scheduled for more than two Early Payment Years.  However, after an Early Payment Year has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Year election have been completed, a  
  
   10 
    
  2180844.5 

Participant may elect a new Early Payment Year for future deferrals of Base Salary and/or Bonuses.  
    
  Effective January 1, 2017, an Early Payment Benefit election filed with respect to all or a portion of the deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during a Plan Year shall also apply to the same portion of any Savings Plan Restoration Contributions attributable to such deferred Base Salary and/or Bonus.  For example: (A) any Early Payment Benefit election made by the Participant with respect to deferred Base Salary earned by the Participant for the 2017 Plan Year shall also apply to the portion of the Savings Plan Restoration Contribution made on behalf of a Participant for the 2017 Plan Year that is attributable to such deferred Base Salary and (B) any Early Payment Benefit election made by the Participant with respect to deferred Bonus earned by the Participant for the 2017 Plan Year and paid during the 2018 Plan Year shall also apply to the portion of the Savings Plan Restoration Contribution made on behalf of a Participant for the 2018 Plan Year that is attributable to such deferred Bonus. 
    
  1.6        DCP Deferral Accounts  .  The Committee shall establish and maintain a separate DCP Deferral Account for each Participant.  A DCP Deferral Amount shall be credited by the Company to the Participant s DCP Deferral Account, subject to the Committee s authority in Section 4.1(a), as of the date that the Participant s Base Salary and/or Bonus would otherwise have been paid.  Such DCP Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment.  The Committee shall establish an Early Payment Year Subaccount within a Participant s DCP Deferral Account for each Early Payment Year elected by that Participant.  Any such Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be debited by the amount of any Early Payment Benefit paid by the Company to the Participant in such Early Payment Year pursuant to Section 5.4 as of the date of payment.   
  1.7        SEDCP Deferral Accounts  .  The Committee shall maintain a separate SEDCP Deferral Account for each Participant who was a participant in the SEDCP on December 31, 1998.  The balance of such Participant s accounts under the SEDCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to each such Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, a predecessor to this Plan, as of January 1, 1999.  SEDCP Deferral Accounts shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. 
  1.8        Interest  .  Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the Declared Rate, compounded monthly.  Except as provided in Section 5.2(a), with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account.  Amounts of deferred Compensation that are credited to a DCP Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed from date of crediting to the end of the month.  Effective  
  
   11 
    
  2180844.5 

August 1, 2016, interest shall be credited to Deferral Accounts at the Declared Rate on a daily basis with monthly compounding.  
  1.9        Valuation of Deferral Accounts  .  The value of a Deferral Account as of any date shall equal the amounts previously credited to such Deferral Account less any payments debited to such Deferral Account plus the interest deemed to be earned on such Deferral Account in accordance with Section 4.4 through such date.  When payments are made from a DCP Deferral Account for any reason other than an Early Payment Benefit elected after January 1, 1994, such payments shall be deemed to be made on a proportionate or pro-rata basis from DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred under the 1988 DCP prior to January 1, 1994, and DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred after that date.   
    
  1.10        Savings Plan Restoration Contribution  .   
  (a)        General Rule  .  Effective for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2017, the Company shall credit to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of any Participant an amount equal to the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant s Base Salary for such Plan Year and/or the Participant s Annual Bonus (as defined in the Savings Plan) paid in such Plan Year because of deferrals under this Plan, assuming that the Participant s contribution percentage under the Savings Plan for the Plan Year is 5 percent.  The Savings Plan Restoration Contribution shall be credited to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of each Participant for each Plan Year at the same time as the Company contribution for such Plan Year is made to the Savings Plan.  With respect to Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 2017, Savings Plan Restoration Contributions were credited to Participants  Savings Plan Restoration Accounts under this Plan for periods prior to January 1, 2009, but not for the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016 (during which period such contributions were instead credited under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II).  
  (b)        Vesting  .  A Participant s interest in credits to his Savings Plan Restoration Account attributable to periods prior to January 1, 2009 and earnings thereon shall vest at the same rate and at the same time as would have been the case had such contribution been made to the Savings Plan.  As of January 1, 2017, all amounts credited to a Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account, including credits attributable to periods prior to January 1, 2009, credits attributable to periods on and after January 1, 2017 and credits under paragraph (c) below are 100% vested at all times.   
  (c)        Transfer of Non-Vested Savings Plan Restoration Account from Prior Plan  .  Effective as of January 1, 2005, that portion of a Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account under the Prior Plan that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, was transferred to and credited to such Participant s Savings Plan Restoration Account under the 2005 DCP and is governed by the terms of this Plan, including any Distribution Election Form filed under the  
  
   12 
    
  2180844.5 

2005 DCP on or before December 31, 2005.  If the Participant was not participating in the 2005 DCP in 2005, the Participant could nevertheless make an election in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and 5.2 of the 2005 DCP if such election was made by December 31, 2005.  If the Participant did not file a Distribution Election Form on or before December 31, 2005, with respect to such amount, together with interest the Participant was deemed to have made an election to receive distribution in accordance with Section 5.1(a).   
  1.11        Statement of Deferral Accounts  .  The Committee shall submit to each Participant, within 120 days after the close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable, setting forth the Participant s Deferral Account(s). 
  1.12        Pre-Merger Payment Elections  .  Any payment elections made or deemed to be made by a Participant under the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP and in effect immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006 shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless and until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan.  The Committee shall establish and maintain separate subaccounts for each Deferral Account as may be necessary to account for amounts subject to different payout elections. 
  1.13          BENEFITS 
  1.14        Separation from Service for a Reason other than Death  . 
  (a)        Form and Time of Benefit  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Sections 5.1 and 5.4, upon a Participant s Separation from Service for a reason other than death (including Retirement), the Company shall pay to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year of the Participant s Separation from Service an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.  Any Retirement Benefit paid in annual installments pursuant to Section 5.1(b) shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year, beginning with the year following the Participant s Retirement and shall be determined based on the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the last day of the month preceding payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Participant who is a Specified Employee is entitled to a distribution from the Plan upon or by virtue of such Participant s Separation from Service for a reason other than death, the lump sum payment or the first annual installment payment, as the case may be, shall be paid in the month next following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, if later than the time provided above.  Any additional installment payments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year. 
  (b)        Retirement  .  (i) On a Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that a Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, a Participant (A) may elect to have the Retirement Benefit, but which will not include any amounts attributable to an Early Payment Year Subaccount if Separation from Service occurs after beginning of the relevant Early  
  
   13 
    
  2180844.5 

Payment Year, paid to him in a lump sum or annual payments for any other number of years between two (2) and 20 years, and (B) may elect to have the amount of each annual installment determined under either the Amortization Method (if permitted hereunder) or the Fractional Method.  If a Participant fails to elect either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method, such Participant shall be deemed to have elected the Fractional Method.   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Eligible Employee who commences or resumes participation in the Plan on or after January 1, 2017, (A) the only payment forms that such Participant may elect with respect to his Retirement Benefit shall be a lump sum or annual payments over five (5), ten (10), fifteen (15) or twenty (20) years and (B) only the Fractional Method for determining installments shall be available.  
  (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an election to receive distribution in a series of annual installments shall be treated as a single payment for purposes of Code Section 409A.   
  (iii) Subject to Section 5.1(b)(iv), a Participant may change his election as to the form of Retirement distribution under this Plan subject to the following conditions:  (A) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee; (B) the election must defer the lump sum payment or the initial amount of an installment payment for a period of at least five (5) years from the date that the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, was otherwise payable; and (C) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made. 
  (iv) A Participant may only make one change pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(iii).  Such change must satisfy all of the requirements of Section 5.1(b)(iii).  No change may be made following a Participant s Separation from Service.      
  (c)        Separation Prior to Retirement  .  If a Participant s Separation from Service is for any reason other than Retirement or death, then the Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit in a lump sum as provided in Section 5.1(a).   
  (d)        Effect of Pre-Retirement Separation from Service on Spousal Survivor Benefits  .  Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant whose Separation from Service occurs prior to Retirement and receives a Termination Benefit under this Section 5.1. 
  1.15        Beneficiary Benefits  .  
  (a)        If Participant s Separation from Service is due to death, the Company will pay to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum a Beneficiary Benefit that is an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts (other than his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an  
  
   14 
    
  2180844.5 

Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)).  If such Participant also has an SEDCP Deferral Account, the Company will also pay to the Participant s Beneficiary annual payments over the greater of (i) 10 years or (ii) until the Participant would have attained age 65 equal to 25% of the amount deferred under the SEDCP (excluding any interest on such deferrals), which payments shall be in full satisfaction of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant s Beneficiary shall instead be paid the amount credited to the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which his death occurred plus interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, from the end of such month and credited annually on each anniversary of the end of such month payable in equal installments (using the Amortization Method) over the period described in the preceding sentence, if the Committee determines that the present value of such benefit is greater than the present value of the benefit described in the preceding sentence.  In comparing the present value of these two alternative benefits, the Committee shall use in each case a discount factor of 8%.  
  (b)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant s Separation from Service is due to death after attaining age 55, payment to his Beneficiary (other than payment of his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)) shall be made in the same form as payment of the Participant s Retirement Benefit would have been made to the Participant if he were living.   
  (c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect, on a Beneficiary Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that the Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, that, if his Separation from Service is due to death prior to attaining age 55, payment to his Beneficiary (other than payment of his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any) and amounts in his or her Early Payment Year Subaccount attributable to an Early Payment Year beginning before the date of the Participant s death (if any)) shall be made in any form and calculated in any other manner described in Section 5.1(b) (which may be different than the form of payment elected by the Participant for his Retirement Benefit).  A Participant may change his election as to the form of payment to his Beneficiary subject to the following conditions:  (1) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee and (2) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made.  Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of this Section 5.2(c).   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Eligible Employee who commences or resumes participation in the Plan on or after January 1, 2017, the elections described above in this Section 5.2(c) shall not be available. In the event of such a Participant s Separation from Service due to death prior to attaining age 55, payment to his Beneficiary instead shall be made as provided in Section 5.2(a) above.  
  
   15 
    
  2180844.5 

(d)        If a Participant dies after Separation from Service but before commencement or completion of his benefits under the Plan, payment to his Beneficiary shall be made in the same amount, at the same time and in the same form as payment would have been made to the Participant if he were living under this Plan.  If installment payments to the Participant have already commenced, then the remaining installments (if any) shall be paid to his Beneficiary in the same amounts and at the same times as such remaining installments would have been paid to the Participant if he were living.       
  (e)        The payment or payments to a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant under Section 5.2(a), (b) or (c) (including payments with respect to the SEDCP Deferral Account) shall be made or commence during the period beginning on the date of the Participant s death and ending on December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant s death occurs.  If payment is to be made in installments, the first installment only shall be made during the period specified in the preceding sentence, with any subsequent installments paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year. The amount of any such payment shall be equal to, or determined based on, the value of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment. 
  (f)        Effective January 1, 2017, in the event that the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies prior to the completion of payments under this Plan to that Beneficiary, then the remaining benefit shall be paid in a lump sum to the person or persons designated by the Beneficiary in accordance with procedures established by the Committee or, if no such person has been designated, then to the Beneficiary s estate.  Such lump sum payment shall be made during the period beginning on the date of the Beneficiary s death and ending on December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year in which the Beneficiary s death occurs.   
  (g)        Any election as to the form and manner of payment to a Beneficiary in effect under the terms of the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006, shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless or until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan.  The Committee shall establish and maintain separate subaccounts for each Deferral Account as may be necessary to account for amounts subject to different beneficiary payout elections. 
  1.16        Spousal Survivor Benefits with Respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts  .  If a Participant who has an SEDCP Deferral Account dies after becoming eligible for Retirement or after commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit and a spouse to whom he had been married to for at least one (1) year prior to his death survives beyond completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance, the Company shall pay such spouse a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 10% of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance valued as of the earlier of the date of the Participant s Retirement or death.  Such lump sum spousal survivor benefit shall be paid 120 days following the later of the completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance or the Participant s death.  No benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.3 if the Participant s spouse does not survive beyond completion of payment of the Participant s SEDCP Deferral Account balance.  Notwithstanding the  
  
   16 
    
  2180844.5 

foregoing, no spousal survivor benefit shall be payable to the spouse of any Participant who received benefits pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (Termination Benefit) or Section 5.6 (Immediate Payment on Change in Control). 
  1.17        Early Payment  .  Payment of the amounts credited to any Early Payment Year Subaccount of a Participant shall be paid or commence to be paid within the first 90 days of the year elected as the Early Payment Year in accordance with the Participant s election under Section 4.1(b), with any subsequent annual payments paid in the first 90 days of each applicable year.  The amount of each annual installment will be determined under the Fractional Method unless the Participant otherwise irrevocably elects the Amortization Method at the time of making the Early Payment Benefit election. A Participant may not elect the Amortization Method for Early Payment Benefits earned on or after January 1, 2017.    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason prior to the Early Payment Year elected by the Participant, the election made by the Participant to receive the Early Payment Benefit shall terminate and the amount credited to the Participant s Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be paid, together with the other amounts credited to the Participant s Deferral Account, as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be.  If the Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason after the start of the Early Payment Year but before the commencement or completion of the Early Payment Benefit, the benefit or remaining benefit attributable to the relevant Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be paid to the Participant (or his Beneficiary) in accordance with the Participant s Early Payment Benefit election without regard to the Participant s Separation from Service (i.e., once the Early Payment Year is reached, the Participant s subsequent Separation from Service for any reason shall not affect the payment of the relevant Early Payment Year Subaccount).    
    
  1.18        Emergency Benefit  .  In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, within 60 days following such determination, an Emergency Benefit that does not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant s assets to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship and the additional compensation available to the Participant upon the termination of the Participant s current deferral elections under the Plan, as described in the following paragraph of this Section 5.5.  Such Emergency Benefit shall be taken pro rata from each of the Participant's Deferral Accounts, including the Participant's DCP Deferral Account, SEDCP Deferral Account and Savings Plan Restoration Account, as applicable, and pro rata from any subaccounts, such as an Early Payment Year Subaccount, within any such Deferral Account.   
  Whenever a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.5, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the distribution.  The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next enrollment period  
  
   17 
    
  2180844.5 

under the Plan and will be precluded from electing to make new deferrals under the Plan for a minimum period of one (1) year (or such lesser period as the Committee may permit) following receipt of the distribution.  Such new election shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.1(a). 
    
  1.19        Effect of Change in Control  .  In the event of a Change in Control, the Board may, in its sole discretion, within the 30 days preceding such Change in Control, irrevocably take action to terminate and liquidate the Plan, provided that the requirements of Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) (or any successor provision) are satisfied. 
  1.20        Small Benefit  .  Notwithstanding any election by a Participant to receive payment of any account maintained for the Participant under the Plan in an installment payment form, if the value of such account is less than $50,000 at the time payment in such form is scheduled to commence under Section 5.1 or 5.2, the account shall be paid to the Participant in a single lump sum on the scheduled commencement date.  This provision shall not apply to (i) any Early Payment Year Subaccount that is being paid pursuant to an Early Payment Benefit election or (ii) the Beneficiary benefit with respect to a Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account described in Section 5.2(a).        
  1.21        Tax Withholding and Reporting  .   
  (a)        To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, the Company shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law. 
  (b)        The Company shall have the right at its option to (i) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant s Deferral Accounts or (ii) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant s Deferral Accounts.  In addition, as permitted by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi) (or any successor provision), payments may be made under the Plan to pay any Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code Sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) on the Participant s Deferral Accounts, and to pay any income tax imposed under Code Section 3401 (  i.e.,   wage withholding) or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable state or local law as a result of payment of the FICA amount, as well as to pay the additional income tax attributable to the pyramiding wages and taxes.  The total payment may not exceed the aggregate FICA tax amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax amount.  
  1.22        Reemployment  .   
  (a)        If, after a Participant s Separation from Service, such Participant is reemployed by the Company prior to the payment of his benefits in a cash lump sum payment or while he is receiving benefits in the form of annual installment payments, the payment of the lump sum amount or the future installments, as the case may be, shall be made as scheduled without regard to the Participant s reemployment.  
  
   18 
    
  2180844.5 

(b)        A reemployed Participant may elect to again participate in this Plan and to defer additional Base Salary and/or Bonus as provided in Section 4.1, in which case a new Deferral Account shall be established for such Participant to which allocations relating to the period following the Participant s re-employment shall be credited.  The Participant also shall be permitted to file a new Distribution Election Form, simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that the Participant files upon his reemployment, governing the payment of his new Retirement Benefit in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and payment to his Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.2(c) (provided that payment of any amounts previously forfeited pursuant to Section 4.6 and restored upon the Participant s reemployment shall be made in the form applicable at the time of his prior termination in accordance with the rules set forth herein).  
  1.23        Qualified Divorce Orders  .  Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Committee under Section 9.3(b) hereof and the provisions of this Plan, benefits may be paid from the balance of a Participant s Deferral Account(s) in accordance with a Qualified Divorce Order.   
  1.24        Special 2006 Transition Rule Elections  .   
  (a)        Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, pursuant to the transition rules under Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance thereunder, each Participant who has not separated from service as of October 12, 2006 may make a new payment election (a  Special Transition Rule Election ) with respect to (i) the balance of his Deferral Accounts as of December 31, 2006 together with interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his  December 31 Balance ) and/or (ii) any deferred 2006 bonus (i.e., that portion of any bonus earned in 2006 and payable in 2007 that the Participant elected to defer under this Plan) plus interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his  2006 Deferred Bonus ).  As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive his Retirement Benefit in any form described in Section 5.1 and calculated under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method.  In addition, the Participant may elect up to two Early Payment Years with installment payments (if any) calculated under the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(b) or Section 5.4 to the contrary, a Participant may elect any Early Payment Year other than 2006 regardless of the year in which the Compensation was deferred, except that (i) the earliest Early Payment Year that a Participant may elect with respect to his 2006 Deferred Bonus is 2008, and (ii) if a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year with respect to his December 31 Balance, payment will be made in July of 2007.  A Participant may elect that all, any portion or no portion of his December 31 Balance and/or all, any portion or no portion of his 2006 Deferred Bonus be paid in an Early Payment Year, but (i) the Participant may not select more than two Early Payment Years under this Special Transition Rule Election and may not elect any additional Early Payment Years under Section 4.1(b) if such election would result in more than two scheduled Early Payment Years and (ii) the Participant may not make different elections with respect to the form or manner of calculation of his Retirement Benefit with respect to his December 31 Balance and his 2006 Deferred Bonus.   
  
   19 
    
  2180844.5 

(b)        Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has separated from service due to Retirement as of October 12, 2006, he may make a new payment election with respect to his December 31 Balance.  As part of such election, the Participant may elect (1) to receive a lump sum distribution of his entire Deferral Account balance in July of 2007 or (2) to change the number of Retirement Benefit installment payments as permitted under Section 5.1, provided that the Participant may not extend the number of installments to more than twenty annual installments (including installment payments that have already been made).   
  (c)        If a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year for his December 31 Balance, he may not elect to defer any Compensation earned in 2007 under this Plan.  
  (d)        In addition, as part of the special election under this Section 5.12, a Participant may change the form and manner of calculation of the payment of benefits to his Beneficiary in the event that the Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement. 
  (e)        A Participant must elect the same form and manner of calculating his Retirement Benefit under (a) or (b) of this Section 5.12 and the same form and manner of calculating his Beneficiary Benefit under (d) of this Section 5.12 as he elects for such benefits under the 2005 DCP and the DCP2.   
  (f)        Any election under this Section 5.12 must be made by November 3, 2006, or such later date as permitted by the Committee, but in no event later than December 31, 2006.     
  (g)        A Participant s election under this Section 5.12 shall supersede any previous election made or deemed to be made under this Plan, the 2005 DCP, or the DCP2.  If a Participant does not timely make an election under this Section 5.12, the elections he otherwise made or makes or was deemed to make shall apply and may be changed only in accordance with the other terms of this Plan and any Compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2007, shall be subject to the Participant s election under the 2005 DCP (or, the DCP2 if the Participant was a participant in the DCP2 but not the 2005 DCP) or as subsequently amended in accordance with the other terms of this Plan.  However, any distribution election that had not become effective by October 12, 2006, shall be null and void.   
  1.25        Plan Provisions Control. 
  (a)        Payment Commencement Prior to November 1, 2008  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if installment payments to a Participant or Beneficiary have commenced prior to November 1, 2008 in accordance with the prior provisions of the Plan, the Participant s remaining account shall be paid over the remaining number of installments in accordance with the rules set forth herein (i.e., within the first 90 days of 2009 and each subsequent calendar year, except as otherwise provided herein). 
  (b)        Distribution Elections Made Prior to November 1, 2008  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has made a distribution election, including a beneficiary distribution election, prior to November 1, 2008, and such election remains in effect  
  
   20 
    
  2180844.5 

on and after that date, including without limitation under Section 4.8 or Section 5.2(g), distributions to such Participant (or his Beneficiary) shall commence and be made in accordance with the rules set forth herein, with such distribution election used only to determine the applicable form of payment (i.e., whether distribution shall be made in a lump sum or installments and, if installments, the number of such installments and the method used for calculating such installments).  
  1.26          BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 
  Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as the Beneficiary to whom payments under this Plan shall be made in the event of the Participant s death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan.  Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant s lifetime on a paper form prescribed by the Committee.  Any Beneficiary designation made by a Participant under the DCP2 and/or the 2005 DCP shall continue to apply under this Plan until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Participant had selected different Beneficiaries under the DCP2 and the 2005 DCP, the following rules shall apply: 
    
  (A)    If the Participant does not make a new election under Section 5.12, the Beneficiary designation under the DCP2 shall apply to the subaccount for the DCP2 under this Plan and the Beneficiary designation under the 2005 DCP shall apply to the subaccount for the 2005 DCP under this Plan unless or until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee. 
    
  (B)    If the Participant does make a new election under Section 5.12, the Participant will be treated as having no Beneficiary designation on file until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation with the Committee.   
    
  The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed. 
    
  If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, any benefits remaining unpaid shall be paid in accordance with the Participant s Beneficiary designation under the Company s Retirement Plan, and if there is no such valid Beneficiary designation, to the Participant s then surviving spouse, or if none, to the Participant s estate, unless directed otherwise by the court that has jurisdiction over the assets belonging to the Participant s probate estate.

  1.33        Amendment  .  The Board may amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, tax, accounting or other changes, which may result in termination of the Plan for future deferrals.  The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board may amend the Plan to (a) ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Code Section 409A for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution and (b) add provisions for changes to deferral elections and elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution.  The Committee appointed pursuant to Article III, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if the Committee determines that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease Plan benefits or costs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for any amendment required to preserve the deferral of taxation of amounts deferred under this Plan, no amendment shall (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted or (b) eliminate the spousal survivor benefit under Section 5.3.  Any amendment that would change the terms of the amendment provisions of this Section 8.1 or the terms of the termination provisions of Section 8.2, shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date such amendment is adopted, unless the amendment is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or the amendment is required in order to preclude any amounts deferred under this Plan from being included in the income of Participants prior to a date of distribution as specified under this Plan.   
  
   23

  1.34        Termination  . 
  (a)        Company s Right to Terminate  .  The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, if in the Board s judgment, the continuance of the Plan would not be in the Company s best interest due to tax, accounting or other effects thereof, or potential payouts thereunder, or other reasons, provided that any termination of the Plan shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date the Board adopts a resolution to terminate the Plan, unless (i) the termination of the Plan is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or (ii) the Participants have become subject to tax on the amounts deferred under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Change in Control, the Plan may not be terminated prior to the date that is three years after the date the Change in Control occurs, or, if earlier, the date on which amounts deferred under the Plan have become taxable to Participants.  In the event the Board adopts a resolution terminating the Plan, the Board or the Committee shall determine the date as of which deferral elections shall cease to have effect in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
  (b)        Payments Upon Termination  .  Distributions to the Participants or their Beneficiaries shall be made on the dates on which the Participants or their Beneficiaries would receive benefits hereunder without regard to the termination of the Plan, except that payments may, in the discretion of the Board, be accelerated if: 
  (A)    The Plan is terminated and liquidated pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Plan;   
    
  (B)    Accelerated payment is otherwise permitted by Treas. Reg.   1.409A 3(j)(4)(ix) (or any successor provision) or other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, or  
    
  (C)    The Plan is terminated because Participants have become subject to tax on their deferrals due to the Plan s failure to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A.  Payment to a Participant may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure. 
    
  1.35          MISCELLANEOUS 
  1.36        Unsecured General Creditor  .

1.37        Trust Fund  .  The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan.  At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits.  Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company s creditors.  To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.  No assets shall be transferred to a trust if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code Section 409A(b).  
  1.38        Nonassignability  .   
  (a)        Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable.  No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency.   
  (b)        Notwithstanding subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized.  The Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Committee constitutes a Qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders.  In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order.   
  1.39        Release from Liability to Participant  .  A Participant s right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of a Participant s Deferral Account(s) has been paid or set side for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order.  The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts, and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order.   
  1.40        Employment Not Guaranteed  .  Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to be retained in employment with the Company.  Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation 
  Supplemental Retirement Plan II 

Effective as of January 1, 2005 
  Amended and Restated as of January 1, 2017 

Contents 

Article 1. Introduction 
  1.1     Adoption and Restatements of the Plan 
  The Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II (the  Plan ) was originally adopted by Occidental Petroleum Corporation (the  Company ), effective as of January 1, 2005.   
    
  Effective November 1, 2008, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the  Supplemental Retirement Plan ) was merged with and into this Plan, which was amended and restated as of that date.  Effective November 1, 2008, the account of each participant under the Supplemental Retirement Plan was transferred to this Plan and has since been governed by the terms of this Plan.   
    
  This January 1, 2017 restatement of the Plan is generally effective as of January 1, 2017, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein.  This restatement of the Plan incorporates all amendments to the Plan adopted subsequent to the November 1, 2008 restatement and, in addition, makes further changes to the Plan, including to the Plan s participation, contribution and distribution provisions.    
    
  1.2    Purpose of the Plan 
  It is the purpose of this Plan to provide eligible employees with benefits that will compensate them for the loss of benefits under the Retirement Plan or Savings Plan during their period of service in the Plan Year on account of the maximums and other limitations imposed by law upon contributions to such qualified plans, including for these purposes the maximum contributions that may be made under Code section 415, the maximum amount of compensation that may be taken into account under Code section 401(a)(17), and the limitation on pensionable compensation that may be taken into account under Code section 415 and 401(a)(4).  The portion of the Plan reflecting credits to compensate for the maximum limits imposed by Code section 415 is intended to constitute an  excess plan  as defined in ERISA section 3(36).  The remaining portion of the Plan is intended to constitute a plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees and is intended to meet the exemptions provided in ERISA sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1), as well as the requirements of Department of Labor Regulation section 2520.104-23.  The Plan shall be administered and interpreted so as to meet the requirements of these exemptions and the regulation. 
  1.3     Status of the Plan 
           (a) 
    Nonqualified Plan.   The Plan is not qualified within the meaning of Code section 401(a). The Plan is intended to provide an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future and thus not to involve, pursuant to Treas. Reg.   1.83-3(e), the transfer of  property  for purposes of Code section 83. Likewise, allocations under this Plan to the account maintained for a Participant, and earnings credited thereon, are not intended to confer an economic benefit upon the Participant nor is the right to the receipt of future benefits under the Plan intended to result in any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee being in constructive receipt of any amount so as to result in any benefit due under the Plan being includible in the gross income of any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee in advance of the date on which payment of any benefit due under the Plan is actually made. 
              (b) 
    Compliance with Code Section 409A.   This Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A and related regulatory guidance, so that the taxation of Participants and Beneficiaries on any compensation deferred under this Plan is deferred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts that are credited and paid annually from a Participant s account following the Participant s attainment of a specified age, as described in Sections 5.1(b)(1) and 5.8(b)(1), are intended to qualify as short-term deferrals under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4) (or any successor provision) and accordingly to be exempt from such requirements. 
              (c) 
    No Guarantees of Intended Tax Treatment.   The Plan shall be administered and interpreted so as to satisfy the requirements for the intended tax treatment under the Code described in this section. However, the treatment of benefits earned under and benefits received from this Plan, for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws (such as state income and employment tax laws), shall be determined under the Code and other applicable tax laws and no guarantee or commitment is made to any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee with respect to the treatment of accruals under or benefits payable from the Plan for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws. 
     1.4     Application of the January 1, 2017 Restatement of the Plan 
    
           (a) 
    General Effective Date.    This restatement of the Plan is generally effective as of January 1, 2017.  This restatement of the Plan applies to active Participants who receive allocations under the Plan for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2017.  In addition, this restatement applies to Participants, including terminated Participants, who have undistributed benefits under the Plan as of January 1, 2017.  All distributions made under the Plan on or after January 1, 2017 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this restatement, as amended from time to time.     
       
           (b) 
    Earlier Application of Certain Provisions of Restatement.    Certain provisions of this restatement take effect on dates prior to January 1, 2017, as set forth herein. In this regard: 
       
           (1) 
    Section 3.1 applies to any individual who has not met the Plan s prior participation requirements on or before November 30, 2016.   
       
           (2) 
    Section 3.2 applies to any individual who is reemployed by an Employer or again meets the requirements of Section 3.1 on or after December 1, 2016. 
       
           (3) 
    Article 4 (Benefits) generally sets forth the allocations earned by Participants for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.  The provisions governing allocations earned by Participants for prior Plan Years are set forth in earlier iterations of the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, however, (A) effective August 1, 2016, the contingent credits described in Section 4.1 shall be credited on a payroll basis in lieu of a monthly basis and (B) for the 2016 Plan Year, the allocation described in Section 4.2 shall be made solely in accordance with the provisions of this January 1, 2017 restatement.  In addition, effective August 1, 2016, interest shall be credited to Participants  accounts on the basis described in Section 4.3.

For the purpose of this paragraph, the term  Shift Basis  means any arrangement whereby Participants work the assigned hour daily shifts which may result in alternating work weeks of more and less than 40 hours per week.

           (G) 
    Base Pay of Record does not include long-term disability payments or payments made to any Participant pursuant to the Occidental Chemical Corporation Weekly Sickness and Accident Plan unless: 
       
           (i) 
    Such payments are made to the Participant through the payroll accounting department of the Company or an Affiliate, and

The filing of any new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed.   
     If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be the person or persons entitled to receive the Participant s benefits under the Retirement Plan in the event of the Participant s death, provided, that if a Participant has previously designated a Beneficiary under Appendix A of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan who survives the Participant, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be the person or persons so designated under Appendix A of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual shall be considered an Employee if such individual is not classified as a common-law employee in the employment records of the Employer, without regard to whether the individual is subsequently determined to have been a common-law employee of the Employer. The persons excluded by this paragraph from being Employees are to be interpreted broadly to include and to have at all times included individuals engaged by the Employer to perform services for such entity in a relationship that the entity characterizes as other than an employment relationship, such as where the Employer engages the individual to perform services as an independent contractor or leases the individual s services from a third party. The exclusion of the individual from being an Employee shall apply even if a determination is subsequently made by the Internal Revenue Service, another governmental agency, a court or other tribunal, after the individual is engaged to perform such services, that the individual is an employee of the Employer for purposes of pertinent Code sections or for any other purpose. 
  In addition, an individual who has been an Employee and a Participant in the Plan shall cease to be treated as an Employee if: (1) the individual is classified as a temporary employee by the Employer and (2) the individual s level of services for the Employer has been reduced to the extent that the individual is treated as having experienced a Separation from Service for purposes of this Plan.

    It is bound by such terms and conditions relating to the Plan as the Company or the Administrative Committee may reasonably require; 
              (2)

              (3)

    The Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record exceeds the Threshold Amount for the Plan Year.   
       
           (b) 
    The Employee (1) is eligible to participate in both the Retirement Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan, (2) is eligible to receive a bonus granted under any management incentive compensation plan of an Employer, and (3) has made a deferral election with respect to such bonus under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
       
           (c) 
    The Employee s Base Pay Paid plus Annual Bonus Paid exceeds the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17), as adjusted and in effect for the Plan Year.   
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Employee who is entitled to receive supplemental retirement benefits upon his or her retirement pursuant to a written contract of employment between the Employee and the Company or an Affiliate shall be ineligible to be a Participant effective for future allocations as of the first day of the Plan Year following the effective date of such contractual provision.   
  An individual who ceases to be an Employee shall cease active participation in the Plan for purposes of any allocations for the Plan Year under Article 4, regardless of the individual's entitlement, if any, to subsequent payments of base salary, wages, or awards of Annual Bonuses.

  If a Participant terminates employment and is subsequently reemployed as an Employee by an Employer, the Participant shall resume active participation in the Plan on the first Entry Date after the date on which the Participant again meets one or more of the requirements set forth in Section 3.1.  A Participant who ceases to actively participate in the Plan because he no longer meets any of the requirements set forth in Section 3.1 shall resume active participation in the Plan on the first Entry Date after the date on which the Participant again meets one or more such requirements.  This provision shall apply to any Participant who is reemployed or again meets the requirements of Section 3.1 on or after December 1, 2016.

  Article 4. Benefits 
  4.1     Allocations Relating to the Retirement Plan 
           (a) 
    Restoring Shortfall Due to Qualified Plan Contribution and Compensation Limits. 
              (1) 
    Eligibility.   Effective for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2017, the following Employees who become Participants shall earn an allocation in the amount specified in paragraph (2) for services performed in the Plan Year: 
       
  An Employee: 
    
           (i) 
    Who is eligible to participate in the Savings Plan and the Retirement Plan for the Plan Year, and 
       
           (ii) 
    Whose annualized Base Pay of Record exceeds the Threshold Amount applicable to the Employee for the Plan Year. 
       
  If the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record increases during the Plan Year such that it exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Employee shall be eligible for the allocation specified in paragraph (2) as of the first Entry Date after the date on which the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record exceeds the Threshold Amount. If the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record decreases during the Plan Year such that it no longer exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Employee shall cease to be eligible for the allocation specified in paragraph (2) as of the first Entry Date after the date on which the Employee s annualized Base Pay of Record falls below the Threshold Amount. 
    
  (2)      Allocation Amount. 
    
           (i) 
    Contingent Credit.   For services performed during a Plan Year by a Participant described in paragraph (1), a credit shall be made for each payroll period to a contingent account maintained for such Participant. The amount of the credit is set forth below.  For avoidance of doubt, references below to the  Annual Bonus paid  refer only to the portion of an Employee s Annual Bonus that is actually paid to the Employee and not deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
       
  The amount of the credit shall equal the sum of:  
    
           (A) 
    7 percent of Base Pay of Record and Annual Bonus paid for the payroll period below the Wage Base; plus 
       
           (B) 
    12 percent of Base Pay of Record and Annual Bonus paid for the payroll period above the Wage Base. 
       
           (ii) 
    Annual Reorganization.   The amounts contingently credited to the account maintained for the Participant during the Plan Year under paragraph (i) shall be reduced as of the last day of the Plan Year, but not below zero, by the amount determined under this paragraph. The reduction amount is intended to be equal to the Employee s allocation under the Retirement Plan for the Plan Year assuming that the Employee maximized deferrals under the Savings Plan.      After the reduction described in this paragraph, the remaining amount shall be permanently credited to the account maintained for the Participant. 
       
           (A) 
    No reduction shall apply to the account maintained for any Participant who is not an Employee on the last day of the Plan Year. 
       
           (B) 
    The reduction amount for other Participants shall be equal to the dollar limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 415(c)(1)(A) minus any Retirement Plan allocations to date, minus the sum of (x) the Contribution Percentage Limit for the Plan Year, determined under Appendix E of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision) times the Participant s Base Pay Paid and, effective January 1, 2015, 5 percent of the Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year, and (y) effective January 1, 2015, 7 percent times the sum of the Participant s Base Pay Paid and Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year.   
       
  For purposes of determining the reduction under this paragraph, no portion of the sum of the Participant s Base Pay Paid and Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year in excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) in effect for the Plan Year shall be taken into account. The reduction amount shall not be less than zero. 
    
           (iii) 
    Earnings Allocation.   The Employer shall also permanently credit earnings on the allocations under paragraph (i) for the Plan Year as if such allocations shared in earnings at the rate and in the manner described in Section 4.3. The earning allocation under this paragraph shall not be subject to reduction under paragraph (ii). 
       
  (b)      Restoring Shortfall Due to Qualified Plan Limit on Pensionable Compensation. 
    
           (1)

    Who makes a deferral election with respect to Annual Bonus under the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Plan Year. 
               (2) 
    Allocation Amount.    The amount to be allocated to the account of a Participant described in paragraph (1)  for services performed during the relevant Plan Year shall equal 12 percent multiplied by the amount of Annual Bonus the Participant has deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no allocation shall be made to the account of a Participant who is not an Employee on the date such bonus is awarded. 
     The allocation described in this Section 4.1(b) shall be made to the account of each Participant effective as of the date on which the Participant is awarded his or her Annual Bonus. 
  4.2     Allocations Relating to Savings Plan 
           (a) 
    Eligibility for Allocations Relating to Limits Under Code Section 401(a)(17).    An Employee who is eligible to participate in the Savings Plan for the Plan Year and whose Base Pay Paid plus Annual Bonus Paid for the Plan Year exceeds the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17), as adjusted and in effect for the Plan Year, shall earn an allocation in the amount specified in paragraph (b) for the applicable Plan Year for services performed during such Plan Year.  
              (b)

    5 percent of the amount allocated under paragraph (1) which shall be allocated to the account maintained for the Participant in lieu of interest on such amount for the Plan Year. 
     The amounts to be allocated to a Participant s account for the Plan Year under this Section 4.2 shall be calculated and allocated in December of such Plan Year or within 70 days following the end of such Plan Year.   

4.3     Maintenance of Accounts 
           (a) 
    Each Employer shall establish and maintain, in the name of each Participant employed by that Employer, an individual account which shall consist of all amounts credited to the Participant. As of the end of each month, the Administrative Committee shall increase the balance, if any, of the Participant s individual account as of the last day of the preceding month, by multiplying such amount by a number equal to one plus .167% plus the monthly yield on 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturities for the monthly processing period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any allocation made to a Participant's account pursuant to Section 4.1(b) shall be credited with interest, at a rate equivalent to that set forth in the preceding sentence, from the date such allocation is made to the Participant's account.   
     Effective August 1, 2016, interest shall be credited to individual accounts, at a rate equal to the monthly yield on 5-year Treasury Constant Maturities plus 2%, on a daily basis with monthly compounding. 
           (b) 
    The individual account of each Participant shall represent a liability, payable when due under this Plan, out of the general assets of the Company, or from the assets of any trust, custodial account or escrow arrangement which the Company may establish for the purpose of assuring availability of funds sufficient to pay benefits under this Plan, provided that  no assets shall be transferred to a trust or other account if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code section 409A(b). The money and any other assets in any such trust or account shall at all times remain the property of the Company, and neither this Plan nor any Participant shall have any beneficial ownership interest in the assets thereof. No property or assets of the Company shall be pledged, encumbered, or otherwise subjected to a lien or security interest for payment of benefits hereunder. Accounting for this Plan shall be based on generally accepted accounting principles. 
     4.4     Vesting and Forfeiture 
  Notwithstanding any other Plan provision, all benefits under this Plan shall be contingent and forfeitable and no Participant shall have a vested interest in any benefit unless, while he is still employed by an Employer, he becomes fully vested in his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan (or would have become vested if he were a participant in the Retirement Plan).  A person who terminates employment with an Employer for any reason prior to becoming vested hereunder shall not receive a benefit, provided that, upon rehire by an Employer, any amounts forfeited by a Participant at the time of his or her termination of employment shall be restored, without interest, to his or her account and, as provided in Section 5.8, shall be subject to the same payment election or elections previously made by the Participant with respect to such amounts.  
  Article 5. Payments 
  5.1     Timing and Form of Payments 
           (a) 
    Payment Events.    A Participant s vested account under this Plan shall be paid on the earliest to occur of the following payment events:  
              (1) 
    The Participant s attainment of a specified age elected by the Participant that is age 60 or above; 
              (2) 
    The Participant s Separation from Service; or 
              (3) 
    The Participant s death.  
       
  (b)      Timing and Form. 
    
           (1) 
    Attainment of Specified Age.    If payment is made on account of a Participant s attainment of a specified age (60 or above), payment shall be made to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant reaches the specified age.  In addition, within the first 70 days of each subsequent calendar year, the Participant shall be paid any additional amounts credited to the Participant s account since the prior payment date.   
       
           (2) 
    Separation from Service. 
       
           (A) 
    If payment is made on account of the Participant s Separation from Service, payment shall be made or commence within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant s Separation from Service occurs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Participant who is a Specified Employee, payment shall be made or commence in the month next following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, if later than the time provided above.   
       
           (B) 
    Payment shall be made in a single lump sum or in annual installments over 5, 10, 15, or 20 years, as elected by the Participant.  If the Participant elects to have payment made in annual installments, the installments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year during the installment period (except that the first installment may be delayed in the case of a Specified Employee as provided above).  During the installment period, the Participant s account shall continue to be adjusted as provided in Section 4.3(a) until the installments have been completed.  The amount of each annual installment shall equal the amount credited to the Participant s account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of payment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the number of installments (including the current installment) which remain to be paid.  
       
           (C) 
    If a Participant who is receiving installment payments on account of his Separation from Service has also made a specified age election and attains the specified age before the completion of all installments, the remaining installments shall be paid to him at the scheduled time or times without regard to his attainment of such age.  
       
           (3) 
    Death.    If payment is made on account of the Participant s death, then notwithstanding any payment elections made by the Participant, payment of the Participant s entire vested account shall be made to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum during the period beginning on the date of the Participant s death and ending on December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant s death occurs.

           (1) 
    An Employee who became a Participant on or after November 1, 2008 and before December 1, 2016 was permitted to make the payment elections provided for in Section 5.1 (i.e., an election to have payment made at a specified age (60 or above) prior to Separation from Service and/or an election as to form of payment upon Separation from Service) at the commencement of his or her participation in the Plan (within 30 days after date the Employee first met one or more of the requirements for participation previously set forth in Section 3.1)  in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Administrative Committee for the time and manner of making elections. An Employee who becomes a Participant in 2017 shall not be permitted to make a payment election with respect to allocations for the 2017 Plan Year and, accordingly, as provided in paragraph (3) below, such allocations shall be paid in a single lump sum at the time provided in Section 5.1(b)(2). 
              (2) 
    An Employee who became a Participant before November 1, 2008 was permitted to make a transition election as set forth in Section 5.9.  If the Employee did not make a transition election with respect to form of payment upon Separation from Service and had previously made an election to have payment upon Separation from Service made in a lump sum or in annual installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, payment on account of the Participant s Separation from Service shall be made in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(2) in the form previously elected by the Participant.  For this purpose, if the Participant had different payment elections in effect for his or her account under this Plan and his or her account under the Supplemental Retirement Plan prior to November 1, 2008, or had an election in effect under one plan but not the other, the accounts shall continue to be maintained separately and these provisions shall be applied separately to each account.   
              (3) 
    If a Participant who commenced participation before December 1, 2016 did not elect to have payment made at a specified age, payment shall be made on the earlier of the Participant s Separation from Service or death in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(2) or (3), as applicable.  If such a Participant did not elect an installment payment option for payment on account of a Separation from Service, any payment on account of the Participant s Separation from Service shall be made in a single lump sum at the time provided in Section 5.1(b)(2).   
              (b) 
    Changes in Time or Form of Payment.     A Participant may elect to change the time or form of payment of his or her account in accordance with the rules set forth below.  For purposes of these rules, an election to receive distribution in a series of annual installments shall be treated as a single payment.   
              (1) 
    Permitted Changes.    
              (A) 
    A Participant may elect to change the form of payment upon Separation from Service.

    A Participant who has elected payment at a specified age may elect another specified age that is age 65 or above, subject to the limitations of paragraph (2). 
               (2) 
    Requirements.    Any election by a Participant under this paragraph shall meet the following requirements: 
              (A) 
    The election shall not be effective until at least 12 months after the election is filed with the Administrative Committee; 
              (B) 
    The election must defer payment (or payment of the initial installment, if applicable) for a period of at least five years from the date that payment (or payment of the initial installment, if applicable) would otherwise have been made; and 
              (C) 
    The election must be made at least 12 months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which payment (or payment of the initial installment, if applicable) is otherwise scheduled to be made.     
              (3) 
    Additional Rules.    A Participant may make only one change pursuant to this Section 5.2(b).  A change must satisfy all of the requirements of Section 5.2(b)(2).  No change may be made following a Participant s Separation from Service.    
       
           (c) 
    Procedures.    All payment elections under this Plan shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the rules and procedures established by the Administrative Committee for the time and manner of making elections.     
       
  5.3     Death 
  If a Participant dies before the complete distribution of his or her account, the account or remaining account shall be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum during the period beginning on the date of the Participant s death and ending on December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant s death occurs.  
    
  5.4    Small Benefits 
  Notwithstanding any election by a Participant to receive payment of any account maintained for the Participant under the Plan in an installment payment form, if the value of such account is less than $50,000 at the time payment in such form is scheduled to commence, the account shall be paid to the Participant in a single lump sum on the scheduled commencement date.      
    
           5.5 
    Valuation of Benefits 
     The amount of any payment to a Participant under this Article shall be determined based on the value of the Participant s vested account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of payment. 
    
  5.6     Qualified Divorce Orders 
  Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Administrative Committee under Section 9.3(b), payment may be made from the balance of a Participant s vested account to the extent necessary to fulfill a Qualified Divorce Order. 
  5.7     Tax Withholding  
           (a) 
    To the extent required by law in effect at the time payments are made, the Participant s Employer shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law. 
              (b) 
    The Participant s Employer shall have the right at its option (1) to require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Employer may be required to withhold with respect to amounts credited to the Participant s account or (2) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Employer may be required to withhold with respect to amounts credited to the Participant s account.  In addition, as permitted by Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi) (or any successor provision), payments may be made under the Plan to pay any Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) on the Participant s account, and to pay any income tax imposed under Code section 3401 (  i.e.,   wage withholding) or the corresponding withholding provisions of applicable state or local law as a result of payment of the FICA amount, as well as to pay the additional income tax attributable to the pyramiding wages and taxes.  The total payment may not exceed the aggregate FICA tax amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax amount.  

5.8    Reemployment 
    
           (a) 
    Continued distribution of account.    If a Participant who is receiving payment or is scheduled to receive payment of his or her account due to his or her Separation from Service is reemployed by an Employer or Affiliate prior to the complete distribution of the account, the account or subaccount shall be paid to the Participant at the scheduled time or times without regard to the Participant s reemployment.  
       
           (b) 
    New account.    If a terminated Participant is reemployed by an Employer and resumes active participation in the Plan, a new account shall be established for such Participant to which allocations relating to the period following the Participant s reemployment (and any unvested amounts forfeited from the Participant s account at the time of his first termination) shall be credited.  Such new account, to the extent vested, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the Participant s most recent payment election, if any, prior to his first termination.  For this purpose, the following rules shall apply: 
       
           (1) 
    If the Participant had previously elected (including pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(1)) to have payment made at a specified age (60 or above) prior to Separation from Service or death and has reached such specified age at the time of his reemployment, the Participant shall be paid, within the first 70 days of each calendar year following the calendar year containing his reemployment date, the amount credited to his account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of payment.  
       
           (2) 
    Any election made as a terminated Participant pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(2) or (3) shall not be taken into account for purposes of this provision.  Instead, if the Participant had, prior to such transition election, made an election under this Plan to have payment upon termination made in a lump sum or in annual installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, payment on account of the Participant s subsequent Separation from Service shall be made in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(2) in the form previously elected by the Participant. 
       
           (3) 
    If the Participant has no prior election taken into account under the foregoing provisions, payment shall be made in a single lump sum in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(2) upon the Participant s subsequent Separation from Service.

Payment pursuant to any such election shall be made as provided in Section 5.1. 
       
           (B)

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Participant previously covered by Appendix A of the Supplemental Retirement Plan who made the election described in Appendix A to have payment made or commence upon attainment of a specified age between 55 and 70-1/2, if the Participant did not make a transition election under this Section 5.9(b)(1) to have payment made at a new specified age, then payment to the Participant shall be made or commence within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the later of: (A) the Participant s Separation from Service and (B) the Participant s attainment of the specified age previously elected by the Participant, provided that, if the Participant is a Specified Employee and payment is made on account of the Participant s Separation from Service, payment shall be made or commence in the month next following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, if later than the time provided above.  Payment shall be made in the form (i.e., lump sum or installments over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years) elected by the Participant under this Section 5.9(b)(1) or, if the Participant did not make a transition election, the form previously elected by the Participant under Appendix A of the Supplemental Retirement Plan, or, if none, in a lump sum.

           (2) 
    The Board and each member of the Board and any Employer who has responsibility (whether by delegation from another person, an allocation of responsibilities under the terms of this Plan document, or otherwise) for a fiduciary duty, a nonfiduciary settlor function (such as deciding whether to approve a plan amendment), or a nonfiduciary administrative task relating to the Plan. 
       
           (b) 
    The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees and court costs, incurred by that person on account of his or her good faith actions or failures to act with respect to his or her responsibilities relating to the Plan. The Company s indemnification shall include payment of any amounts due under a settlement of any lawsuit or investigation, but only if the Company agrees to the settlement. 
       
           (1) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section only if he or she notifies an Appropriate Person at the Company of any claim asserted against or any investigation of the Indemnified Person that relates to the Indemnified Person s responsibilities with respect to the Plan. 
       
           (A) 
    A person is an    Appropriate Person    to receive notice of the claim or investigation if a reasonable person would believe that the person notified would initiate action to protect the interests of the Company in response to the Indemnified Person s notice. 
       
           (B) 
    The notice may be provided orally or in writing. The notice must be provided to the Appropriate Person promptly after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the claim or investigation.  No indemnification shall be provided under this section to the extent that the Company is materially prejudiced by the unreasonable delay of the Indemnified Person in notifying an Appropriate Person of the claim or investigation. 
       
           (2) 
    An Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to attorney s fees, court costs or other litigation expenses or any settlement of such litigation only if the Indemnified Person agrees to permit the Company to select counsel and to conduct the defense of the lawsuit. 
       
           (3) 
    No Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to any action or failure to act that is judicially determined to constitute or be attributable to the willful misconduct of the Indemnified Person. 
       
           (4) 
    Payments of any indemnity under this section shall be made only from insurance or other assets of the Company. The provisions of this section shall not preclude such further indemnities as may be available under insurance purchased by the Company or as may be provided by the Company under any by-law, agreement or otherwise, provided that no expense shall be indemnified under this section that is otherwise indemnified by the Company or by an insurance contract purchased by the Company. 
       
           (5) 
    Payment of any indemnity under this section that is not exempt from Code section 409A shall comply with Code section 409A s requirements for reimbursement plans, as set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) (or any successor provision).  For this purpose, (i) the indemnity under this section shall continue for the Indemnified Person s lifetime, and, if later, until the complete disposition of all covered claims, (ii) the amount of expenses indemnified during one taxable year of an Indemnified Person shall not affect the amount of expenses indemnified in any other taxable year; (iii) payment of an indemnity shall be made by the last day of the Indemnified Person s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred and (iv) the Indemnified Person s right to indemnification shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.  If, after payment of any amount to the Indemnified Person pursuant to this provision, it is determined, pursuant to paragraph (3) above or otherwise, that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Indemnified Person shall promptly repay such amount to the Company. 
       
  Article 7. Amendment and Termination 
  7.1     Amendment and Termination 
  The Company expects the Plan to be permanent, but since future conditions affecting the Company or any Employer cannot be anticipated or foreseen, the Company must necessarily and does hereby reserve the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board, except that no amendment shall reduce the dollar amount permanently credited to a Participant s account and any such termination or amendment shall apply uniformly to all Participants.  The Administrative Committee, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if it finds that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease benefits or costs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Administrative Committee may amend the Plan to: 
    
           (a) 
    Ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Code section 409A for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution; and 
       
           (b) 
    Add provisions for changes to elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Code section 409A for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution. 
       
           7.2 
    Payments Upon Termination 
     If the Plan is terminated, distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries shall be made on the dates on which such distributions would be made under the Plan without regard to such termination, except that payments may, in the discretion of the Board, be accelerated if: 
    
           (a) 
    Accelerated payment is permitted under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) (or any successor provision); or 
       
           (b) 
    The Plan is terminated because Participants have become subject to tax on their deferrals due to the Plan s failure to satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A.  Payment to a Participant may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of such failure.  
     7.3     Reorganization of Employer 
  In the event of a merger or consolidation of an Employer, or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of an Employer to another corporation, such continuing, resulting or transferee corporation shall have the right to continue and carry on the Plan and to assume all liabilities of the Employer hereunder without obtaining the consent of any Participant or Beneficiary.  If such successor shall assume the liabilities of the Employer hereunder, then the Employer shall be relieved of all such liability, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to assert any claim against the Employer for benefits under or in connection with the Plan.

  Article 9. General Provisions 
  9.1     Unsecured General Creditor 
  The rights of a Participant, Beneficiary, Alternate Payee or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company or Employer promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company or any Employer, nor shall any assets of the Company or any Employer be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises. 
  9.2     Trust Fund 
  The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan.  At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Administrative Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits.  Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company s creditors.  To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.  No assets shall be transferred to a trust if such transfer would result in the taxation of benefits prior to distribution under Code section 409A(b).  
    
  9.3     Nonassignability 
    
           (a) 
    Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amount, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable.  No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
       
           (b) 
    Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized. The Administrative Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Administrative Committee constitutes a qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders.  In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order. 
     9.4     Release from Liability to Participant 
  A Participant s right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of the account maintained for the Participant has been paid or set aside for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order.  The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which: (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts; and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order. 
  9.5     Employment Not Guaranteed 
  Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to be retained in employment with the Company or any Employer.  Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement to the contrary, the Company and Employer shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. 
  9.6     Gender, Singular   Plural

  9.8     Validity 
  In the event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of this Plan. 
  9.9     Notice 
  Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrative Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company.  Such notice shall be deemed given as to the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
  9.10     Applicable Law 
  The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Code section 409A (or any successor provision), and any regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable.  To the extent that the Plan covers individuals who first became Participants prior to January 1, 2017 (including their Beneficiaries and others claiming benefits through such Participants), it shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.

 EXHIBIT 10.4

Exhibit 

OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION         EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN (EICP)         (As Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2016) 

PURPOSE 
    
  The Occidental Petroleum Corporation Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the    Plan   ) is designed to provide selected employees with annual cash incentive opportunities. Awards are based on the achievement of objectives that reflect business success and generate stockholder value. The Plan directly links Participants  incentive compensation with the performance of the Company as a whole or the Division where they have personal accountability, as applicable, and also promotes the Company s results-oriented management style. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth on   Attachment A   hereto. 
    
  ELIGIBILITY/PARTICIPATION 
    
  All Senior Management employees are eligible for participation in the Plan.  A member of Senior Management who is selected by the Administrator to participate in the Plan is referred to herein as a    Participant  ;  provided, that, to the extent required with respect to Awards intended to be Section 162(m) Awards, Participants will be selected by the Committee. 
    
  PERFORMANCE PERIOD 
    
  The performance period shall be the period for which the performance objectives applicable to an Award are measured, which unless otherwise determined for an Award, shall be the one-year period beginning on January 1 of a given year and ending on December 31 of that same year (the    Performance Period   ). 
    
  PERFORMANCE MEASURES/OBJECTIVES 
    
  Unless otherwise determined for any Award, each Award will consist of a  Company performance  portion and an  individual performance  portion. The weighting of the Company performance portion and the individual performance portion of each Award will be established at the time the Award is granted to reflect the significance of business and individual performance with respect to each such Award (e.g., for a particular Award, the Company performance portion may be weighted 60% and the individual performance portion may be weighted 40%). 
    
  The extent to which the Company performance portion of each Award is earned and payable shall be determined by assessing performance for the applicable Performance Period with respect to certain Business Objectives. For each Award, during the first 90 days of each year, the Business Objectives to be used for the Performance Period, as well as the weighting, if applicable, of each Business Objective (  e.g.,   50% Segment Earnings and 50% Cash Flow) shall be established. The Business Objectives selected, and their weightings, if applicable, may vary by Participant and may be changed from one Performance Period to the next Performance Period in response to changes in business priorities.  
    
  The extent to which the individual performance portion of each Award is earned and payable shall be determined by a subjective assessment of each Participant s performance for the applicable Performance Period with respect to certain Personal Objectives. 
    
  A targeted performance level with respect to the Business Objectives shall be established for each Participant, which represents the desired performance level for the Performance Period. In addition, unless otherwise determined with respect to an Award, a minimum and maximum level of performance with respect to the Business Objectives shall also be established for each Participant for the Performance Period. Target, minimum and maximum performance levels may also be established with respect to Personal Objectives.  
    
  Participants shall be advised of the Business Objectives that will be used to determine their Awards for the Performance Period, any weighting allocation of the various Business Objectives, as well as the weighting allocation between Business Objectives and Personal Objectives. 
    
  SECTION 162(M) AWARDS 
    
  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, designate at the time of grant that an Award (or portion thereof) to a Covered Employee is a Section 162(m) Award. Any portion of an Award designated as a Section 162(m) Award will be separate from a non-Section 162(m) Award. A Section 162(m) Award granted under this Plan also constitutes a  Section 162(m) Award  under the LTIP and is subject to all the terms and conditions of the LTIP governing  Section 162(m) Awards  (as defined in the LTIP), including but not limited to the per person award limitations in Section 5 of the LTIP and Section 6(k) of the LTIP. Business Objectives for any Section 162(m) Award shall be based on one or more of the business criteria specified in Section 6(k)(i)(B)(1) of the LTIP, shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent required with respect to Awards intended to be Section 162(m) Awards, all determinations under this Plan related to such Awards will be made by the Committee in accordance with Section 6(k)(i) of the LTIP. 
    
  AWARD LEVELS 
    
  A Target Award shall be established at the beginning of each Performance Period for each Participant. Individual Target Award levels may reflect variations in job function and scope and the potential impact the Participant has on the Company s or a Division s, as applicable, business priorities. If a Participant has a more senior position, a greater portion of total compensation may be placed  at risk.  Award minimums and maximums may also be established for each Performance Period for performance levels below and above target performance. Award opportunity levels corresponding to the minimum, target and maximum levels of performance may vary by Participant. 
    
  PAYMENT OF AWARDS 
    
  The amount of an Award earned and payable under the Plan shall be determined by evaluating performance against Business Objectives and Personal Objectives for the applicable Performance Period, and the actual amount paid with respect to an Award may be higher or lower than a Participant s Target Award, depending on whether the minimum, target or maximum performance target, if applicable, has been met. The Administrator shall evaluate satisfaction of Business Objectives and Personal Objectives and determine Award payment amounts, with final approval made by (i) the Committee, with respect to all Participants who are subject to Section 16 or who are Covered Employees, or (ii) the CEO, or such other member(s) of Senior Management as the CEO may designate from time to time, for all other Participants.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in determining the payment amount of each Award (including any Section 162(m) Award), the Administrator may reduce (including a reduction of the payment to $0) the amount that may otherwise be earned and payable with respect to such Award if, in its sole discretion, it determines that such reduction or elimination is appropriate.  
    
  Awards shall be paid no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the Performance Period. Awards shall be paid: (i) in a lump sum cash payment, (ii) through the issuance of Stock, (iii) through the grant of equity-based award(s) or (iv) through any combination of the foregoing. Any Stock issued or equity-based award(s) granted in payment of Awards shall not be issued under the Plan but shall instead be issued under the LTIP, subject to the terms thereof, and the number of shares of Stock issued (or number of shares of Stock subject to the equity-based award granted) will generally be equal to the dollar value of the Award otherwise payable divided by the Fair Market Value (as defined in the LTIP) of a share of Stock on the date of final approval, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator. All applicable taxes and withholdings shall be deducted from Award payments in accordance with federal, state and local regulations. Cash Awards may be deferred under the MDCP in accordance with the provisions of the MDCP. 
    
  PLAN CHANGES DUE TO COMPANY ACTIVITY 
    
  Acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, significant corporate changes and/or extraordinary events involving the Company may require changes or amendments (including reduction, elimination or termination) to outstanding unvested Awards and/or an applicable Performance Period s targets, minimums, maximums, Business Objectives, Personal Objectives and/or Award opportunities. In such cases, any changes or amendments shall be presented to the CEO and/or the Committee for approval; provided, that, in the case of any Section 162(m) Award, adjustments may only be made in accordance with Section 6(k)(i)(B)(3) of the LTIP. 
    
  AWARD PAYMENT UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
    
  The Administrator may determine in its sole discretion the eligibility for Awards and any payment of Awards to Participants who enter or exit employment, transfer between Divisions, or who are promoted during a Performance Period; provided that, to the extent required with respect to Awards intended to be Section 162(m) Awards, the Committee shall make all such determinations with respect to any Section 162(m) Award. 
    
  PLAN ADMINISTRATION 
    
  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which has sole discretion over the Plan; provided, that, the Committee may delegate to one or more officers or employees of the Company some or all of its powers and responsibilities in connection with the administration of the Plan (including the authority to make Awards to eligible Participants and determinations related thereto) as it deems necessary, advisable or appropriate, except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee (i) shall take all actions and make all determinations hereunder related to Awards to Participants who are then subject to Section 16, and (ii) the Committee may not delegate its authority to the extent (A) it is expressly indicated herein as an action to be taken by the Committee alone, (B) such delegation would permit a person to grant an Award to himself or take any action with respect to any Award previously granted to himself, (C) such delegation would violate any applicable law, or (D) with respect to Awards to Covered Employees that are intended to be Section 162(m) Awards, such delegation would result in the Award failing to so qualify.  Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Committee specifies at the time of such delegation, and the Committee may at any time rescind the authority so delegated.  The Committee and/or any such person to whom administrative powers are so delegated in accordance with the foregoing shall be referred to herein as the    Administrator  .   The decisions of the Administrator with respect to the Plan (including but not limited to questions of construction, interpretation and administration) shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in or under the Plan. Any determination made by the Administrator shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law in the event it is subject to judicial review and shall be overturned by a court of law only if it is arbitrary and capricious.   
    
  PLAN CONTINUATION  
    
  The Company expects and intends to continue the Plan but does not guarantee any specific levels of Award payments or the continuation of any Award payments. The Company, through action of the Committee in its sole discretion, reserves the right to amend, alter, modify, suspend, change, discontinue or terminate this Plan and outstanding unvested Awards at any time, in any manner and for any Performance Period, without the consent of any Participant.  Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, the Company, through action of the CEO, or such other member(s) of Senior Management as the CEO may designate from time to time, shall also have the right, without the consent of any Participant, to amend, alter, modify, suspend or otherwise make changes to this Plan that do not materially increase the cost of the Plan to the Company; provided, that, with respect to Awards to Covered Employees that are intended to be Section 162(m) Awards, no such amendment or other change results in the Award failing to so qualify.   
    
  RECOUPMENT OF AWARDS 
    
  Awards granted under the Plan and any amounts paid or realized with respect thereto  shall be subject to compliance with the Company s Code of Business Conduct, as may be amended, or policies referenced therein (   CBC   ). In the event of a breach or violation of the CBC, the Committee may take actions with respect to Awards under this Plan, including, without limitation, reduction, cancellation, forfeiture and/or recoupment of Awards as determined by the Committee. In addition, Awards granted under the Plan and any amounts paid or realized with respect thereto shall be subject to any written clawback policy that the Company, with the approval of the Company s Board of Directors, may adopt, including any policy adopted to conform to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange and that the Company determines should apply to the Plan. A Participant s acceptance of any Award issued under the Plan will constitute such Participant s agreement to subject the Award and any amounts paid or realized with respect thereto to such potential clawback, reduction, cancellation, forfeiture and/or recoupment in accordance with this Section (   Recoupment of Awards   ). 
    
  MISCELLANEOUS 
    
  The Plan is subject to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations. The Plan and all related documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Texas. If any provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect. 
    
  Nothing contained in the Plan (or in any other documents relating to the Plan or to any Award) shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of any entity within the Company s controlled group or constitute any contract or agreement of employment or other service, nor shall interfere in any way with the right of the applicable entity within the Company s controlled group to change such Participant s compensation or other benefits or to terminate the employment of such Participant, with or without cause.  
    
  Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company, any Division or subsidiary and any Participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights by virtue of an Award under the Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general creditor. 
    
  Awards from the Plan shall not be considered as compensation for the purposes of any benefit plans or programs of the Company or any Division, except as specifically set forth otherwise in a formal plan document. 
    
  It is intended that payments under the Plan qualify as short-term deferrals exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any Award does not qualify for treatment as an exempt short-term deferral, it is intended that such amount will be paid in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Plan shall be interpreted and construed accordingly.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation 
  5 Greenway Plaza, Suite 110  
  Houston, Texas 77046  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 
    
  At your request, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2016, based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).  The results of our third party reserves process review, completed on January 26, 2017 and presented herein, were prepared for public disclosure by Occidental in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth under Section 229.1202(a)(8) of the SEC regulations.  
    
  Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof, and comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2016.  Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. 

Properties Reviewed 
    
  The proved reserves reviewed herein are attributable to the fee, leasehold and royalty interests of Occidental in certain properties located in the United States in the state of Texas and derived through Occidental s economic interest as defined in contractual arrangements for certain properties located in the Middle East.  
    
  The properties reviewed herein were selected by Occidental.  Ryder Scott and Occidental concur that these properties are a valid representation of Occidental s total net proved reserves portfolio as of December 31, 2016.  Based on the estimates prepared by Occidental, the portion of total company net liquid and net gas reserves reviewed by us are expressed as a percentage and presented in summary form on the following page.  At Occidental s request and provided by Occidental, we have also presented the portion of the total company net proved reserves reviewed by us on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis.

Percentage of Total Company Estimated Net Reserves 
  Reviewed by Ryder Scott 
  SEC Parameters 
  Occidental Petroleum Corporation 

The net liquid hydrocarbons reviewed are comprised of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) and are based on standard 42 gallon barrels.  All net gas volumes reviewed are based on an  as sold  basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.      Reserves reviewed and noted herein on a BOE basis are based on converting natural gas on the basis of relative energy content using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one BOE.  It should be noted that barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a BOE basis is, and has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil currently and for a number of years.

  A process review, according to Paragraph 2.2(h) contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), is  the result of an investigation by a person who is qualified by experience and training equivalent to that of a Reserves Auditor to address the adequacy and effectiveness of an entity s internal processes and controls relative to reserves estimation.  
    
  In order to arrive at our conclusions and to substantiate our opinion relative to Occidental s internal reserves estimation process and controls, we conducted our investigation in a manner that closely conforms to the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.  Under Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards, a reserves audit includes  the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, [and] (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used.   
    
  Our process review, however, differs from an SPE reserves audit in that we have not conducted our investigation with sufficient rigor to express an opinion as to  the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or the Reserves Information  as required under item (5) Paragraph 2.2(f) of the SPE auditing standards for a reserves audit.  Our review should not be construed to be a complete and comprehensive appraisal of the subject properties or deemed to convey the same level of information contained in a third party reserves audit or reserves evaluation report.

Applicable Petroleum Reserves Definitions 
    
  The determination of the proved reserves classifications as discussed herein are based on the definitions as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a) released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register, Volume 74, pages 2158 through 2197.   
    
  Reserves and Uncertainty 
    
  The SEC defines reserves as the  estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.   All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating to the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.  The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.  The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.  Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty as to their recoverability.   
    
  In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.  When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.  If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator.  Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.  For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty that the estimates of the quantities actually recovered are  much more likely to be achieved than not.   The SEC defines probable reserves as  those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.   The SEC defines possible reserves as  those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.   All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above. 
    
  The reserves for the properties reviewed by us were estimated by Occidental using deterministic methods and presented as incremental quantities.  Under the deterministic incremental approach, discrete quantities of reserves are estimated and assigned separately as proved, probable or possible based on their individual level of uncertainty.  At Occidental s request, this reserves process review addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein. 
    
  Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.  For proved reserves, the SEC states that  as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.   Moreover, estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised due to other factors such as the results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.

Reserves Process Review Procedure 
    
  Certain technical personnel responsible for the preparation of Occidental s proved reserves estimates presented the data, methods and procedures used in 1) estimating the reserves volumes as of December 31, 2016; 2) documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates; 3) preparing the economic evaluations associated with the estimated December 31, 2016 reserves; and 4) determining the reserves classifications for each of the subject properties reviewed.  We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our review.  Furthermore, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention which brought into question the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy of the data relied upon or the documentation of the reserves estimation process, additional clarification was requested from Occidental until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto.   
    
  Methodology and Procedure Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves 
    
  The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.  The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).  The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain analytical procedures.  These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.  These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.  Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
    
  The proved reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, reservoir modeling or a combination of methods.  Approximately 13 percent of the proved reserves attributable to producing wells or reservoirs for the properties reviewed were estimated by performance methods using decline curve analysis and/or material balance which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.  The remaining 87 percent of the proved reserves attributable to the producing wells for the properties reviewed were estimated by a combination of methods including type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling to 1) estimate those reserves where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive producing trend and 2) estimate the incremental reserves attributable to enhanced/improved oil recovery.  The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the producing properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.  
    
  Approximately 80 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves were estimated by performance methods using analogy to prior established decline trends.  The remaining 20 percent of the proved developed non-producing reserves and all of the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by a combination of methods including volumetrics and type curves supported by analogs and reservoir modeling as noted above.  The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.

Of the properties reviewed, approximately 34 percent of the proved producing reserves and 73 percent of the proved non-producing and undeveloped reserve volumes are related to the application of enhanced/improved recovery techniques.  These enhanced/improved recovery techniques include water and CO   2    injection and infill drilling. 
    
  Occidental uses the latest available production, new well and seismic data in its reserves estimation process.  Typically, this data is from the third quarter of the year for which reserves are estimated, though material data is considered whenever it becomes available prior to finalization of reserves estimates.  The data used by Occidental in their analysis of the proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us was considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.  
    
  Primary Economic Assumptions Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves 
    
  To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Occidental considered many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.  Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.  To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Occidental relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein. 
    
  The hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2016 for the properties reviewed were determined by Occidental using the unweighted 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold and adjustments for differentials as described herein.  In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.  For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. 
    
  The table below summarizes Occidental s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Occidental s  average realized prices.   The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Occidental s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Occidental s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.  A summary of average realized prices are not included for properties located in the Middle East because of host government s limitations on the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.

    Occidental Petroleum Corporation

As indicated above, the product prices that were used by Occidental to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and distance from market, referred to herein as  differentials.   The differentials used by Occidental were accepted as factual data.  We have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.   
    
  While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may also increase or decrease from existing levels, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration by Occidental in this process and omitted by us in conducting this review. 
    
  Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved reserve estimates of gas reviewed.  The proved gas volumes included herein attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves for those fields where the inclusion of such volumes was appropriate. 
    
  Operating costs used by Occidental are based on the operating expense reports of Occidental and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.  For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.  The operating costs for non-operated properties include the Council of Petroleum Accounting Societies overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.  The operating costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.   
    
  Development costs used by Occidental are based on authorizations for expenditure (AFE) for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.  The development costs used by Occidental were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Occidental.   
    
  The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us were incorporated by Occidental in accordance with Occidental s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2016.  The implementation of Occidental s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Occidental s management.  As a result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Occidental has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Occidental s management at the appropriate local, regional and corporate level.  In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement requirements or other administrative approvals external to Occidental.  Additionally, Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.  While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2016, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation. 
    
  Future Production Rate Assumptions Employed by Occidental for Estimating Reserves 
    
  Occidental s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.  If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.  An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.  
  
   RYDER SCOTT COMPANY   PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

    Occidental Petroleum Corporation 
  January 26,   2017 
  Page 7 

If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.   
    
  Test data and other related information were used by Occidental to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.  For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date determined by Occidental.  Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Occidental s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.  Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing or recompleting wells and constraints set by regulatory bodies.   
    
  The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated by Occidental because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity or other operating conditions, market demand and allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
    
  Reserves Derived by Occidental Through Certain Production Sharing Contracts 
    
  The reserves for certain properties located in the Middle East reviewed herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or an economic interest in such production.  Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Occidental for the production of these volumes.  The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.  Occidental s net hydrocarbon volumes for the fields reviewed in the Middle East include certain amounts corresponding to in-country income taxes where the terms of the production sharing contract include provisions for an in-kind settlement process, where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax for and on behalf of the contractor (in this case Occidental).  Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.  Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Occidental s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter. 
    
  Possible Effects of Regulation on Occidental s Estimate of Reserves 
    
  Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Occidental operates or has interests.  Occidental s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.  These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time.  Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the quantities estimated by Occidental as reviewed herein. 
    
  We have not made any field examination of the properties.  No consideration was given in this review to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor to any costs for the potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.

Occidental has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political, environmental or economic obstacles that currently are expected to materially impact their ability to recover the estimated proved reserves for the properties reviewed by us. 
    
  Data Reviewed in Conducting the Third Party Reserves Process Review 
    
  Occidental has informed us that they have furnished or otherwise made available to us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this review.  In conducting our process review of Occidental s estimates of proved reserves and forecasts of future production and income, we have reviewed data used by Occidental with respect to property interests owned or otherwise held, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, development plans, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements.  Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data utilized by Occidental.  We consider the factual data utilized by Occidental to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by the engineering and geological staff of Occidental for estimating the proved reserves volumes and preparing the economic evaluations.   
    
  Reserves Process Review Opinion 
    
  We found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in proved reserves estimates for these properties.  Furthermore, we found the estimation process incorporated all pertinent data, utilized a thorough and detailed analytical approach and was supported by a well documented audit trail. 
    
  We consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Occidental and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose thereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein. 
    
  Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Occidental in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties comply with the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2016.  Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
    
  As Adapted From: 
  RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
    
  On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the  Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule  in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  The  Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule  includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.  The  Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the  SEC regulations .  The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.  Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
    
  Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.    All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.  The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.  The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.  Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.  Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.  The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in  229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
    
  Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
    
  Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.  Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.  Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.  Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
    
  Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.  Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.  
  
   RYDER SCOTT COMPANY   PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

    PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
  Page 2 

Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.  These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.   
    
  Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.  
    
  Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
    
  Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X  210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows: 
    
  Reserves.    Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.  In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.  
    
  Note to paragraph (a)(26):   Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.  Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (  i.e.  , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).  Such areas may contain prospective resources (  i.e.  , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).  

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
    
  Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X  210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows: 
    
  Proved oil and gas reserves.    Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.  
    
  (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:  
    
  (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and  
    
  (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.

  (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.  
    
  (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.  
    
  (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:  
  (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and  
    
  (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.  
    
  (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
    
  As Adapted From: 
  RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
  UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 
    
  and 
    
  PETROLEUM RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SPE-PRMS) 
  Sponsored and Approved by: 
  SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE) 
  WORLD PETROLEUM COUNCIL (WPC) 
  AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS (AAPG) 
  SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM EVALUATION ENGINEERS (SPEE) 

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.  Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
    
  Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X  210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows: 
    
  Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:  
    
  (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and  
    
  (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.  
    
  Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
    
  While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
    
  Developed Producing Reserves    
  Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.  
    
  Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.

Developed Non-Producing 
  Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.  
    
  Shut-In 
  Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: 
           (1) 
    completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not  started producing;  
              (2) 
    wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or  
              (3) 
    wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.  
       
  Behind-Pipe 
  Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.   
    
  In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.  

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
    
  Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X  210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows: 
    
  Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.  
    
           (i) 
    Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.  
       
  (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.  
    
  (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in   [Regulation S-X  210.4-10(a)(2)]  , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
