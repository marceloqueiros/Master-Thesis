2008, there were 822,567,021 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

   ITEMS
1 AND 2    BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES   

  In
this report,  Occidental  refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), and/or one or more
entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental conducts its operations through various oil and gas,
chemical and other subsidiaries and affiliates. Occidental s executive offices are located at 10889 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California 90024; telephone (310) 208-8800.  

   GENERAL   

  Occidental s
principal businesses consist of two industry segments operated by OPC's subsidiaries and affiliates. The subsidiaries and other
affiliates in the oil and gas segment explore for, develop, produce and market crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas.
The subsidiaries and other affiliates in the chemical segment (OxyChem) manufacture and market basic chemicals, vinyls and
performance chemicals. For financial information by segment and by geographic area, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Occidental (Consolidated Financial Statements).  

  For
information regarding Occidental's current developments, see the information in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (MD A) section of this report.  

   OIL
AND GAS OPERATIONS   

   General   

  Occidental s
domestic oil and gas operations are located at the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico, Elk Hills and other locations in
California, the Hugoton field in Kansas and Oklahoma, Utah and western Colorado. International operations are located in Argentina,
Bolivia, Colombia, Libya, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. For additional information regarding Occidental's
oil and gas segment, see the information under the caption  Oil and Gas Segment  in the MD A section of this
report.  

   Proved
Reserves, Production and Properties   

  The
table below shows Occidental s total oil and natural gas proved reserves and production in 2007, 2006 and 2005. See the
MD A section of this report, Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the information under the caption
 Supplemental Oil and Gas Information  in Item 8 of this report for certain details regarding Occidental s oil and
gas proved reserves, the estimation process and production by country. On May 1, 2007, Occidental reported to the United States
Department of Energy on Form EIA-28 proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2006. The amounts reported were the same as those
reported in Occidental s 2006 Annual Report.  

   Comparative
Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Production   

  Oil and NGLs in
millions of barrels; natural gas in billions of cubic feet; BOE in millions of barrels of oil equivalent  

(a)   
     
        Includes natural gas
      liquids and condensate.    

(b)   
     
        Natural gas volumes have
      been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of
      oil.    

(c)   
     
        Occidental has
      classified its Pakistan, Horn Mountain and Ecuador operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective application basis
      and excluded them from this table.    

(d)   
     
        Stated on a net basis
      and after applicable royalties. Includes reserves related to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other economic
      arrangements. Proved reserves from PSCs in the Middle East/North Africa and from other economic arrangements in the United
      States were 449 million BOE (MMBOE) and 104 MMBOE in 2007, 486 MMBOE and 119 MMBOE in 2006 and 472 MMBOE and 104 MMBOE in
      2005, respectively.    

(e)   
     
        The 2007 amounts reflect
      the minority interest in a Colombia subsidiary, partially offset by Occidental's share of reserves and production from an
      equity investee in Yemen. The 2006 and 2005 amounts include Occidental's share of reserves and production from an equity
      investee in Yemen and a Russian joint venture, partially offset by the minority interest in a Colombian subsidiary.
      Occidental's joint venture interest in Russia was sold in 2007.

Competition
and Sales and Marketing   

  As
a producer of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government
producers. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases, local conditions
of supply and demand and are sold at  spot  or contract prices or on futures markets to refiners and other market
participants. Occidental competes by developing and producing its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and acquiring
rights to explore in areas with known oil and gas deposits. Occidental also competes by increasing production through enhanced oil
recovery projects in mature and underdeveloped fields and making strategic acquisitions. Occidental focuses its operations in its
core areas of the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America.

ITEM
1A    RISK FACTORS   

    Volatile
global commodity pricing strongly affects Occidental s results of operations.    

  Occidental s
financial results typically correlate closely to the volatile prices it obtains for its commodities. Drilling and exploration
activity levels, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC, competing fuel prices, prevailing currency exchange
rates, price speculation, changes in consumption patterns, weather and geophysical and technical limitations and other matters
discussed in this item affect the supply of oil and gas and contribute to price volatility.  

  Demand
and, consequently, the price obtained for Occidental s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the United States
and global economy, as well as chemical industry expansion cycles. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce
chemicals, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.  

    Occidental s
oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, which affect, among other things, its profitability and its
ability to grow production and replace reserves.    

  Occidental s
future oil and gas production and its results of operations depend, in part, on its ability to profitably acquire, develop or find
additional reserves. Occidental replaces significant amounts of its reserves through acquisitions and large development projects.
Occidental has many competitors, some of which are larger and better funded, may be willing to accept greater risks or have special
competencies. Industry competition for reserves may influence Occidental to:  

shift
      toward higher risk exploration activity;    

pay
      more for investment opportunities;    

purchase
      properties or take on projects of lesser quality; or    

delay
      expected reserve replacement efforts.     

  In
addition, rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the competition for and costs of, and
delays access to, services and supplies needed for production.  

    Governmental
actions and political instability may affect Occidental s results of operations.    

  Occidental s
businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces risks
of:  

changes
      in laws and regulations, including those related to taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, import, export and use
      of products, environmental protection, climate change and energy security, all of which may increase costs or reduce the
      demand for Occidental's products;    

expropriation
      or reduction of entitlements to produce hydrocarbons; and    

refusal
      to extend or grant, or delay in the extension or grant of, exploration, production or development
      contracts.     

  Occidental
may experience adverse consequences, such as risk of loss or production limitations, because certain of its foreign operations are
located in countries occasionally affected by political instability, armed conflict, terrorism, insurgency, civil unrest, security
problems, restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations. Exposure to such risks may
increase as a greater percentage of Occidental s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources.  

    Occidental s
businesses may experience uninsured catastrophic events.    

  The
occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, and events such as well blowouts, oilfield fires,
industrial accidents and other events that cause operations to cease may affect Occidental s businesses. Third-party insurance
may not provide adequate coverage or Occidental may be self-insured with respect to the related losses.  

    Occidental s
reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision.    

  Calculations
of reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability, as well as oil and gas prices, capital
costs and operating costs. If Occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions, its prospects
and stock price could be adversely affected.  

    Occidental
may incur significant losses in exploration or cost overruns in development efforts.    

  Occidental
may misinterpret geologic or engineering data, encounter unexpected geologic conditions or find reserves of disappointing quality or
quantity, which may result in significant losses on exploration or development efforts. Occidental bears the risks of project delays
and cost overruns due to escalating costs for materials and labor, equipment failures, approval delays, construction delays, border
disputes and other associated risks.  

    Occidental
faces risks associated with its mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.    

  Occidental s
merger, acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may: not fully realize anticipated benefits due to delays;
miscalculate reserves or production or experience changed circumstances; bear unexpected integration costs or experience other
integration difficulties; experience share price declines based on the market s evaluation of the activity; assume or retain
liabilities that are greater than anticipated; or be unable to resell acquired assets as planned or at planned prices.

3    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

  Two
OPC subsidiaries have entered into a settlement with the Office of the District Attorney (ODA) for Ventura County, California,
acting on behalf of the California Department of Fish and Game (Department), to resolve alleged statutory violations arising from
past releases of petroleum and production waters from operations in Ventura County acquired in early 2006. The settlement requires
the subsidiaries to pay $150,000 in civil penalties, $98,640 for alleged damages to natural resources and $109,248 to reimburse
costs incurred by the Department, and to install a leak detection system on certain oil and produced water transfer pipelines for an

PRICE RANGE AND DIVIDENDS   

  This
section incorporates by reference the quarterly financial data appearing under the caption  Quarterly Financial Data
(Unaudited)  after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the information appearing under the caption
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  in the MD A section of this report.  Occidental s common stock was held by
40,214 stockholders of record at December 31, 2007, and by at least 345,000 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them
in street name or nominee accounts.  The common stock is listed and traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange. The quarterly
financial data, which are included in this report after the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, set forth the range of
trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend
information.  

  In
May 2006, Occidental amended its Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
to 1.1 billion. The par value per share remained unchanged.  

  On
August 1, 2006, Occidental effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of that
date with distribution of the shares on August 15, 2006. The total number of authorized shares of common stock authorized for
issuance and associated par value per share were unchanged by this action.  All share and per-share amounts have been adjusted to
reflect this stock split.  

  In
2007, the quarterly dividends declared for the common stock were $0.22 per share for the first two quarters of 2007 and $0.25 for
the last two quarters of 2007 ($0.94 for the year).  On February 14, 2008, a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share ($1.00 on an
annualized basis) was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2008. The
declaration of future cash dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on
Occidental s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

   PERFORMANCE
GRAPH   

  The
following graph compares the yearly percentage change in Occidental s cumulative total return on its common stock with the
cumulative total return of the Standard   Poor's 500 Stock Index and with that of Occidental s peer group over the
five-year period ended on December 31, 2007.  The graph assumes that $100 was invested in Occidental common stock, in the stock of
the companies in the Standard   Poor's 500 Index and in a portfolio of the peer group companies weighted by their relative
market values each year and that all dividends were reinvested.  

  In
2007, Occidental revised its peer group by including two international-based oil and gas companies to reflect the peer companies
that Occidental competes against for major global projects and removing Hess Corporation, which is primarily a domestic company with
significant refining operations. The revised peer group consists of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, BP p.l.c.
(BP), Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Occidental.
Analysis for the revised peer group includes five years of historical performance data as noted above for the common stock of each

   Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) (Incorporating Item 7A)   

   STRATEGY   

   General   

  In
this report, "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), and/or one or more entities in
which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental s business is divided into two segments conducted through
oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates. Occidental aims to generate superior
total returns to stockholders using the following strategy:  

Focus
      on large, long-lived oil and gas assets with long-term growth potential;    

Maintain
      financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and    

Manage
      the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures.     

  Occidental
prefers to own large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have
moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective
production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital.  

  At
Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate
above-cost-of-capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental expects to use most
of its cash flow after capital expenditures to enhance stockholders' returns by continuing its program for evaluating dividend
increases and potential stock repurchases.  

  9  

The
chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and
environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these
assets. Asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) businesses. Historically, the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure
requirements.  

   Oil
and Gas   

    Segment
Income    

   ($
millions)   

The
oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for
finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the
overall corporate strategy primarily by:  

Continuing
      to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around
      Occidental s core areas, which are the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin
      America;    

Pursuing
      commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by
      applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir-management practices; and    

Maintaining
      a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices.     

  Over
the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and
disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets.  See "Oil and Gas Segment  
Business Review" for a discussion of these changes.  

  In
addition, Occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the Dolphin Project in Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), the Mukhaizna project in Oman, and Libya for continued growth opportunities.  

  Occidental s
overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development
of mature fields, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California in 1998, followed by a series of
purchases in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico and the integration of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) and Plains
Exploration and Production Company (Plains) operations acquired in 2006.  

  At
the end of 2007, the Elk Hills and Permian assets made up 66 percent of Occidental s consolidated proven oil reserves and 44
percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, these assets accounted for 61 percent
of Occidental s consolidated reserves. In 2007, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 286,000
barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day.  

   Chemical   

    Segment
Income    

   ($
millions)   

OxyChem s
strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain
beginning with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, after which chlorine and ethylene are converted through a series of
intermediate products into PVC. OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale.  

   Key
Performance Indicators   

    General    

  Occidental
seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and
top quartile performance compared to its peers in:  

Total
      return to stockholders;    

Return
      on equity;    

Return
      on capital employed; and    

Other
      segment-specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find
      and develop new reserves, reserves replacement percentage and other similar measures.     

  10  

Debt
Structure    

  Occidental s
year-end 2007 total debt-to-capitalization ratio declined to 7 percent from 36 percent at the end of 2003. During that time,
Occidental has reduced its debt over 60 percent while increasing its stockholders' equity by 186 percent.  

  Since
the second quarter of 2005, Occidental s long-term senior unsecured debt has been rated A- by Standard and Poor s
Corporation, A3 by Moody s Investors Service (Moody's), and A(Low) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. In July 2007, Fitch Ratings
upgraded Occidental's long-term senior unsecured debt rating from A- to A. In December 2007, Moody's and Standard and Poor's raised
their outlook on Occidental's credit ratings from stable to positive. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated
independently of any other rating.  

    Return
on Equity    

(a)   
     
        The Return on Equity for
      2007 was calculated by dividing Occidental's 2007 net income by the average equity balance in 2007.    

(b)   
     
        The three-year average
      Return on Equity was calculated by dividing the average net income over the three-year period 2005-2007 by the average equity
      balance over the same period.     

  Occidental
has focused on achieving top quartile return on equity. In 2007, Occidental's return on equity was 26 percent and the three-year
average return on equity was 29 percent. During the same three-year period, Occidental increased its stockholders  equity by
115 percent and its annual dividend by 82 percent while its stock price increased by 164 percent.  

   OIL
AND GAS SEGMENT   

   Business
Environment   

  Oil
and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short and intermediate term financial performance. Average
yearly oil prices strengthened in 2007 over 2006 levels and ended the year higher than 2006 year-end levels. During 2007, Occidental
experienced an improvement in its price differential between the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidental's
realized prices. Occidental s realized price as a percentage of WTI was approximately 90 percent and 87 percent for 2007 and
2006, respectively. Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it difficult to forecast
realized prices. The average WTI market price for 2007 was $72.32 per barrel compared with $66.23 per barrel in 2006. Occidental's
average realized price for oil in 2007 was $64.77 per barrel, compared with $57.81 per barrel in 2006.  

  The
average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) domestic natural gas prices decreased approximately 9 percent from 2006. For 2007,
NYMEX gas prices averaged $7.12/Mcf compared with $7.82/Mcf for 2006.

Acquisitions
and Dispositions    

  In
June 2007, Occidental completed a fair value exchange in which BP p.l.c. (BP) acquired Occidental's oil and gas interests in Horn
Mountain and received cash. Occidental acquired oil and gas interests in the Permian Basin and a gas processing plant in Texas from
BP. Occidental also sold its oil and gas interests in Pakistan to BP. As a result of these transactions, both the Horn Mountain and
Pakistan operations were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The twelve months of 2007 include
after-tax gains of $230 million related to these transactions.  

  In
January 2007, Occidental sold its 50-percent joint venture interest in Russia for an after-tax gain of approximately $412
million.  

    Permian
Basin    

  The
Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in
the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 19 percent of the total United States oil production.
Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximate 16-percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil
production. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin.  

  A
significant portion of Occidental's Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura Energy Ltd. in 2000.
Additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests were subsequently made. Occidental's total share of Permian
Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged approximately 198,000 BOE per day in 2007. At the end of 2007, Occidental's Permian Basin
properties had 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves.  

  Occidental's
Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. In 2007, Wasson San Andres was Occidental's
largest Permian producing field with an average of approximately 38,000 BOE per day of production and with 311 million BOE of proved
reserves at year-end. This field represents 19 percent of Occidental's 2007 daily Permian Basin production and 26 percent of its
year-end Permian Basin proved reserves.  

  11  

Occidental s
interests in the Permian Basin offer additional development and exploitation potential. During 2007, Occidental drilled
approximately 225 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on outside-operated interests.
Occidental conducted significant development activity on nine carbon dioxide
(CO 2 ) projects during 2007, including implementation of new floods and
expansion of existing CO 2  floods. Occidental also focused on improving
the performance of existing wells. Occidental had an average of 127 well service units working in the Permian area during 2007
performing well maintenance and workovers.  

  Approximately
60 percent of Occidental s Permian Basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of
CO 2  flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. This
involves injecting CO 2  into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent,
causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. These CO 2 
flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.  

   California   

    Elk
Hills    

  Occidental's
interest at Elk Hills includes the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of California s San Joaquin Valley,
which it operates with an approximately 78-percent interest, and other non-unit properties. The Elk Hills field is the largest
producer of gas in California. Oil and gas production in 2007 from the Elk Hills properties was approximately 88,000 BOE per day.
During 2007, Occidental continued to perform infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir
characterization techniques, resulting in 246 new wells being drilled and 507 wells being worked over. At the end of 2007, the Elk
Hills properties had an estimated 519 million BOE of proved reserves.  

    Vintage
Production California    

  In
2006, Occidental combined its California properties acquired from Vintage and Plains with existing California properties (excluding
the Elk Hills, THUMS and Tidelands Oil Production Company (Tidelands) properties). The combined properties produce oil and gas from
more than 50 fields, located mainly in the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento basins.  

  Oil
and gas production from Vintage Production California in 2007 averaged approximately 22,000 BOE per day. At the end of 2007, the
combined properties had an estimated 138 million BOE of proved reserves.  

    THUMS
and Tidelands    

  Occidental
owns THUMS, which conducts the field operations for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California. Occidental acquired
Tidelands in 2006. Tidelands is the contract operator for an onshore oil production unit in Long Beach, California. Occidental's
share of production and reserves from both properties is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing
contract (PSC), whereby Occidental s share of production and reserves vary inversely with oil prices. These contracts do not
transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic
interest as defined in the contracts.  

  For
2007, Occidental's production from THUMS averaged 20,000 BOE per day and proved reserves totaled 97 million BOE at
year-end.  

    Hugoton
and Other    

  Occidental
owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and
Oklahoma.  

  Occidental
also has over 29,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. During 2007, Occidental drilled 56 wells in the
basin.  

  In
2007, Occidental s Hugoton and other operations produced approximately 30,000 BOE per day. At December 31, 2007, proved
reserves totaled 154 million BOE from Hugoton and other operations.

    Dolphin
Project    

  Occidental's
investment in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate
legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E P, LLC, owns a 24.5-percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities
associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural
gas and NGLs in Qatar s North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5-year extension.
This undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in Occidental's financial statements.  

  A
second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy), and is recorded
as an equity investment.  

  Dolphin
Energy is the operator under the DPSA on behalf of the three DPSA participants, including Occidental. Dolphin Energy owns and
operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch natural gas pipeline, which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE. The transportation
of gas through the pipeline started in the first quarter of 2007 using third-party natural gas and production under the DPSA began
in July 2007 from Qatar s North Field replacing the third-party natural gas. These contracts do not transfer any right of
ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in
the contracts. Occidental s share of production was approximately 36,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2007 with
production expected to increase to approximately 55,000 BOE per day in 2008. At December 31, 2007, Occidental s share of proved
oil and gas reserves from the Dolphin Project was 234 million BOE.  

  The
Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $5.7 billion in total, including investments in the local UAE eastern gas
distribution system, the Al Ain-Fujairah and Taweelah-Fujairah pipelines, which were added to improve the natural gas
distribution  

  12  

system
but were not contained in the original scope of the Dolphin Project. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1.4 billion of this
total, with $1.1 billion invested as of December 31, 2007.  

  At
the end of 2007, all offshore facilities within the original scope of the project have been completed along with construction of
three of the four trains in the onshore gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan. The fourth train is expected to be
completed in the first quarter of 2008.  

  The
pipeline has a capacity to transport up to 3.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day. Demand for natural gas in the UAE
and Oman continues to grow and Dolphin Energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies. To help fulfill this growing
demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar.  

    Qatar    

  In
addition to the Dolphin Project, Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and
Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD). In 2007, Occidental continued development of the ISND and ISSD fields to recover additional
reserves through advanced drilling techniques and waterflood expansion. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISND and ISSD projects
were $237 million in 2007.  

  In
October 2007, Occidental acquired Anadarko Petroleum Corporation s 92.5-percent interest in an exploration and production
sharing agreement covering Blocks 12 and 13 located offshore Qatar. Block 13 is an exploration block.  

  These
projects do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on
Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental s production from Block 12, ISND and ISSD averaged
48,000 BOE in 2007. Proved reserves reported for these properties totaled 128 million BOE at December 31, 2007.  

    Yemen    

  Occidental
owns contractual interests in three producing blocks in Yemen, including a 38-percent direct-working interest in the Masila field, a
40.4-percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6-percent direct-working interest and an 11.8-percent equity
interest in an unconsolidated entity, and a 75-percent interest in Block S-1, which was part of the Vintage acquisition. In
addition, Occidental owns an 80-percent working interest in Block 20 and is currently awaiting final approval from the Yemen
government for a 75-percent working interest in Block 75.  

  These
contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on
Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.  

  At
December 31, 2007, production from the Yemen properties was 27,000 BOE per day and proved reserves totaled 24 million
BOE.  

    Oman    

  In
Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each, Block 53, with a 45-percent
working interest, and Block 54, with a 70-percent working interest. Occidental s share of production from Blocks 9, 27 and 53
averaged 25,000 BOE per day in 2007.  

  The
Block 9 agreement provides for two 10-year extensions and Occidental and its partner agreed with the Government of Oman to the first
10-year extension through December 7, 2015.  

  Occidental
and its partners signed a 30-year PSC for the Mukhaizna field (Block 53) with the Government of Oman in 2005. In September 2005,
Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna field. The Mukhaizna field, located in Oman s south central interior, was
discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000. By the end of 2007, Occidental had drilled over 175 new wells and
continued implementation of a major pattern steam flood project. As of year-end 2007, the exit rate of gross daily production had
nearly tripled from the production rate of September 2005. Occidental plans to steadily increase production through continued
expansion of the steam flood project.  

  The
exploitation term for Block 27 is 30 years beginning in September 2005. Occidental and its partners began production in June
2006.  

  Occidental
and its partners signed a new PSC for Block 54 with the Government of Oman in June 2006 with an initial exploration phase of four
years.  

  These
contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on
Occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts.  

  Occidental s
proved reserves for all the Oman properties totaled 65 million BOE at December 31, 2007.  

    Libya    

  In
2005, Occidental signed an agreement with the Libya National Oil Corporation (NOC) which allowed it to re-enter the country and
participate in exploration and production operations in the Sirte Basin, which it left in 1986 pursuant to United States law. This
re-entry agreement allowed Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were
suspended. Occidental s rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010. These contracts do not transfer any
right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as
defined in the contracts. Production during 2007 averaged 22,000 BOE per day. At year-end 2007, proved reserves reported for
Occidental s Libya assets totaled 16 million BOE.  

  In
November 2007, Occidental announced that it had reached an agreement with NOC on new 30-year contracts for major field redevelopment
and exploration in the Sirte Basin.  The new contracts are subject to approval of the Libyan government.  Total expected capital
investment is estimated to be $5 billion over the next five years, of which Occidental's portion will be approximately $1.9 billion.
Under the new  

  13  

contracts,
Occidental (which has a 75-percent working interest) and its partner would pay a signature bonus of $1 billion, of which
Occidental's share is $750 million and which is payable over a three-year period. Occidental and its partner would also contribute
50 percent of the development capital to the project and receive approximately 10 to 12 percent of the gross production, depending
on the specific field.  

   Latin
America   

    Argentina    

  Substantially
all of Occidental s Argentina assets were obtained as part of the acquisition of Vintage in 2006. The assets consist of 23
concessions located in the San Jorge Basin in southern Argentina and the Cuyo Basin and Neuqu n Basin in western Argentina.
Occidental operates 20 of the concessions with a 100-percent working interest.  

  During
2007, Occidental drilled 153 new wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs. Occidental expects to increase
production significantly over the next four years through aggressive drilling, waterflooding and EOR projects. In 2008, Occidental
plans to drill 220 wells, complete the eight waterflood projects initiated in 2007 and implement a number of new waterflood
projects.  

  Occidental s
share of production from Argentina averaged 36,000 BOE per day in 2007. Proved reserves from these assets totaled 177 million BOE at
December 31, 2007.  

    Bolivia    

  In
2006, Occidental s operating subsidiary acquired working interests in four blocks located in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa
Cruz regions of Bolivia as part of the Vintage acquisition. At the end of 2006, Occidental signed two new operation contracts with
commercial terms that provide Bolivia with greater operational control and control over the commercialization of hydrocarbons. These
contracts went into effect in May 2007.  

    Colombia    

  Occidental
is the operator under four contracts within the Llanos Norte Basin: the Cravo Norte, Rond n, Cosecha, and Chipir n
Association Contracts. Occidental s working interests under the four contracts are 42 percent, 44 percent, 53 percent and 61
percent, respectively. Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Ca o Lim n-Cove as oil pipeline and
marine-export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Llanos Norte Basin for export to international
markets.  

  In
the Middle-Magdalena Basin, Occidental signed an agreement with Ecopetrol in 2005 for an EOR project in the La Cira-Infantas (LCI)
field, in which Occidental holds a 48-percent working interest. In December 2006, Occidental entered into the commercial phase of
the project. Production from the field is transported by Ecopetrol through its pipeline and sold to Ecopetrol refineries.  

  Additionally,
Occidental holds various working interests in five exploration blocks.  

  Occidental's
share of 2007 production from its Colombia operations was 37,000 BOE per day and proved reserves reported for these interests
totaled 57 million BOE at the end of 2007.  

   Production-Sharing
Contracts   

  Occidental
conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production and reserves
to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidental's share of production and reserves from THUMS and
Tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to
Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental s economic interest as defined in the
contracts. Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when
oil prices decline. Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices.  

   Proved
Reserves   

    Proved
Reserves - Evaluation and Review Process    

  A
senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In
addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers,
to monitor and review Occidental's oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board
of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent
petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2003.  

  Again
in 2007, Ryder Scott has compared Occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted
industry standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes, the economic
evaluations and reserves classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a
selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s total reserves portfolio. In 2007,
Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 10 percent of Occidental s oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott
has reviewed Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 57 percent of Occidental s reported
oil and gas reserves.  

  Based
on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that
the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by
Occidental.  

    Proved
Reserve Additions    

  Occidental's
consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year-end 2007 of 2,866 million BOE, as compared with the year-end 2006 amount
of 2,833 million BOE. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries  reserves from all sources was 242 million BOE, which was
comprised of an increase of 297 million BOE from proved developed reserves, partially offset by a decrease of 55 million BOE from
proved undeveloped reserves.  

  14  

Proved
developed reserves represented approximately 80 percent of Occidental s total proved reserves at year-end 2007 compared to 78
percent at year-end 2006.  

   Proved
Reserve Additions - Consolidated Subsidiaries - 2007   

Proved
reserves consisted of 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas.  

   Revisions
of Previous Estimates   

  In
2007, Occidental experienced a reduction of 95 million BOE of proved reserves through negative revisions of previous estimates,
primarily in the Dolphin Project, Qatar, Elk Hills, THUMS and Argentina, partially offset by positive revisions in Permian and
Hugoton. Oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, if oil prices increased by $5 per barrel,
less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidental's share of proved reserves by approximately 8 million
BOE. Conversely, if oil prices dropped by $5 per barrel, Occidental's share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount.
Oil price changes also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts, in a manner partially offsetting
the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical
data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative.  

   Improved
Recovery   

  In
2007, Occidental added reserves of 253 million BOE through improved recovery. In the United States, improved recovery additions were
64 million BOE in the Elk Hills field, 52 million BOE in the Permian Basin and 29 million BOE in western Colorado. Foreign additions
included 32 million BOE in Oman, 17 million BOE in Colombia and 15 million BOE in Qatar. The Elk Hills operations employ infill
drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques. In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to
enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional CO 2  flood and
water flood wells.  

   Extensions
and Discoveries   

  Occidental
obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2007, as a
result of such programs, Occidental added reserves of 24 million BOE, including 15 million BOE in Argentina, 3 million BOE in Oman
and 2 million BOE in the Permian Basin.  

  The
success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as
well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of management's control, and will
affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels.  

   Purchases
of Proved Reserves   

  In
2007, Occidental purchased reserves of 60 million BOE, of which 50 million BOE were in the United States and 10 million BOE were in
the Middle East/North Africa. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it
deems reasonable. Acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As
market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.  

    Proved
Undeveloped Reserves    

  Occidental
had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 202 million BOE resulting from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and
purchases, primarily in the Elk Hills field, the Permian Basin, Oman and Argentina. Elk Hills provided 19 percent of this increase.
These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2007
development programs. The Dolphin Project transferred 101 million BOE to the proved developed category during 2007, with no
remaining undeveloped reserves at year end. In the United States, the Elk Hills field and the Permian Basin each transferred 21
million BOE into proved developed reserves from proved undeveloped reserves.  

   Industry
Outlook   

  The
petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural
gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the
availability of supply.  

  Worldwide
oil prices rose throughout 2007 and reached historical highs during the last half of the year. Continued economic growth, resulting
in increased demand, and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could
result in lower crude oil prices.  

  Oil
prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. Oil prices cannot be
predicted with any certainty. The WTI price has averaged approximately $38 per barrel over the past ten years. However, the industry
has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment   Business Environment" section above
for further information.  

  While
local supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day-to-day prices
may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it difficult to forecast prices with
any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged approximately $5.03 per Mcf.

CHEMICAL
SEGMENT   

   Business
Environment   

  The
chemical segment results decreased in 2007 due to the softening United States housing market and continued high feedstock costs,
which led to lower margins in the PVC business. This was partially offset by an increase in demand for United States products in
export markets in 2007 aided by expanding international economies along with favorable foreign currency exchange rates.  

   Business
Review   

    Basic
Chemicals    

  During
2007, demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong, although demand for domestic chlorine slightly
weakened compared to 2006 due to a slowdown in the United States housing sector.  Domestic industry demand for liquid caustic soda
in 2007 was virtually flat compared to the prior year; however, industry export demand increased over 2006. Export demand was
supported by increasing alumina capacity in South America as well as favorable currency exchange rates. Margins in 2007 continued at
2006 levels as pricing and feedstock costs remained relatively unchanged. Pricing for liquid caustic soda started the year strong
and increased every quarter of 2007 aided by unplanned global supply disruptions and a strong export market. OxyChem s
chlor-alkali operating rate for 2007 was 92 percent, which was the same as the industry average operating rate for 2007.  

    Vinyls    

  Domestic
demand for PVC in 2007 was 5 percent below 2006 as a result of the significant slump in housing. This was partially offset by
exports from the United States, which were up 40 percent in 2007 over 2006, resulting in overall demand for PVC being down 2 percent
in 2007. Compared to 2006, margins in 2007 decreased as price increases were not able to compensate for raw material cost increases.
From early 2007 to the end of the year, industry PVC prices increased by 31 percent while the cost of ethylene increased by 56
percent. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 78 percent for 2007, compared to the North American
industry average of 85 percent.  

   Industry
Outlook   

  In
2007, Occidental's chemical business earnings were lower than 2006, primarily due to the weakening of the United States housing
market.  

  Future
performance will depend on the recovery of United States construction activity, global economic activity, the competitiveness of the
United States in the world economy, feedstock and energy pricing, and the impact of additional production capacity entering the
market place.  

    Basic
Chemicals    

  Forecasts
of a slowing United States economy offset by a continued strong export market in 2008 are expected to result in demand levels
similar to 2007 levels. Despite continued pressure on the vinyls market, margins in 2008 are expected to remain similar to 2007, but
could weaken in the second half due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in mid 2008.  

    Vinyls    

  Industry-wide
PVC operating rates are expected to be lower in 2008 as a result of weak demand, especially in housing, coupled with the start-up of
new capacity in the first half of the year. Exports of United States produced products are expected to maintain their competitive
advantage due to the weak United States dollar. Cost pressures are also expected to continue due to high feedstock costs.  

   CORPORATE
AND OTHER   

  Corporate
and Other includes investments in two cogeneration facilities in Taft, Louisiana and Ingleside, Texas and two common carrier
pipelines in the Permian Basin, one of which was purchased in 2007, which are used in corporate-directed activities.  

  In
2007, Occidental resolved certain legal disputes that resulted in a gain of approximately $112 million.  

  On
August 1, 2006, Occidental effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of that
date with distribution of the shares on August 15, 2006. All share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K reflect the effect of the stock split.  

  In
October 2006, Occidental sold 10 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Company's (Lyondell) common stock in a registered public
offering for a pre-tax gain of $90 million and gross proceeds of $250 million. In 2007, Occidental sold all of its remaining shares
of Lyondell common stock (approximately 21 million shares) for a pre-tax gain of $326 million and gross proceeds of $672
million.  

   SEGMENT
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

  The
following discussion of Occidental s two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Segment
earnings generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated
corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and
losses from dispositions of segment assets and results and other earnings from the segments' equity investments.  

  16  

The
following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:  

  In millions, except
per share amounts  

(a)   
     
        These amounts represent
      revenue from cogeneration plants and common carrier pipelines.    

(b)   
     
        The 2007 amount includes
      an after-tax gain of $412 million from the sale of Occidental's interest in a Russian joint venture, an after-tax gain of $112
      million from certain litigation settlements, a pre-tax gain of $103 million from the sale of exploration properties, a pre-tax
      gain of $35 million from the sale of miscellaneous domestic oil and gas interests and a $74 million pre-tax loss from the
      impairment of properties. The 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounts include interest income of $10 million, $10 million and $11 million,
      respectively, from loans made to an equity investee.    

(c)   
     
        The 2005 amount includes
      a $139 million charge for the write-off of two previously idled chemical plants and one operating plant and an additional
      charge of $20 million for the write-down of another chemical plant.    

(d)   
     
        The 2007, 2006 and 2005
      amounts include $167 million, $31 million and $42 million, respectively, of interest charges to redeem or purchase and retire
      various debt issues.    

(e)   
     
        As a result of changes
      in compensation programs in 2006, Occidental wrote off approximately $40 million of the related deferred tax asset that had
      been recognized in the financial statements prior to the changes. The 2005 amount includes a $335 million tax benefit due to
      the reversal of tax reserves no longer required, a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the U.S.
      Internal Revenue Service resolving certain foreign tax credit issues and a $10 million charge related to a state income tax
      issue.    

(f)   
     
        The 2007 amount includes
      a $326 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Occidental s remaining investment in Lyondell, a $47 million pre-tax charge
      for a plant closure and related environmental remediation reserve and a $25 million pre-tax severance charge. The 2006 amount
      includes a $90 million pre-tax gain from the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell and a $108 million pre-tax gain related to
      litigation settlements. The 2005 amount includes a $726 million pre-tax gain from Valero Energy Corporation's (Valero)
      acquisition of Premcor, Inc, (Premcor) and the subsequent sale of the Valero shares received and a $140 million pre-tax gain
      from the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell common stock.    

(g)   
     
        In June 2007, Occidental
      completed an exchange of oil and gas interests in Horn Mountain with BP for oil and gas interests in the Permian Basin and a
      gas processing plant in Texas. Occidental sold its oil and gas interests in Pakistan to BP. The 2007 amount includes after-tax
      income of $326 million related to these transactions and their operating results and a $4 million after-tax charge from assets
      classified to discontinued operations in 2006. In January 2006, Occidental completed the merger of Vintage into a subsidiary
      and classified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale. In May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidental s contract for
      the operation of Block 15. The 2006 amount includes a $253 million after-tax loss for Ecuador and the Vintage properties held
      for sale and $242 million after-tax income for the operations of Horn Mountain and Pakistan.

  17  

Oil
and Gas    (continued)  

Oil
and gas segment earnings in 2007 were $8.3 billion, compared to $6.9 billion in 2006. Oil and gas segment earnings in 2007 include
an after-tax gain of $412 million from the sale of Occidental s interest in a Russian joint venture, an after-tax gain of $112
million from certain litigation settlements, a pre-tax gain of $103 million from the sale of exploration properties, a pre-tax gain
of $35 million from the sale of miscellaneous domestic oil and gas interests and a $74 million pre-tax loss from the impairment of
properties. In addition to the matters discussed above, oil and gas segment earnings for 2007, compared to 2006, reflected higher
crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production, partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization
(DD A) rates and higher operating and exploration expenses.  

  Oil
and gas segment earnings in 2006 were $6.9 billion, compared to $5.7 billion in 2005. The increase in oil and gas segment earnings
was primarily due to higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including
increased DD A, which was driven by higher volumes and rates.  

  Average
consolidated production costs for 2007 were $12.87 per BOE, compared to the average 2006 production cost of $11.70 per BOE. The
increases resulted from higher field operating and maintenance costs.  

   Chemical   

Chemical
segment earnings in 2007 were $601 million, compared to $906 million in 2006. The decrease in segment earnings is primarily due to
lower margins in PVC.  

  Chemical
segment earnings in 2006 were $906 million, compared to $614 million in 2005. The increase in chemical segment earnings is primarily
due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and PVC.  

   SIGNIFICANT
ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS   

  The
following table sets forth the effects of significant transactions and events affecting Occidental s earnings that vary widely
and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

TAXES   

  Deferred
tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion, were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The current portion of the
deferred tax assets of $230 million is included in prepaid expenses and other.  The net deferred tax assets are expected to be
realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.  

   Worldwide
Effective Tax Rate   

  The
following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:  

(a)   
     
        Revenues, oil and gas
      pre-tax income and income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf of $1.3
      billion, $1.1 billion and $887 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively.    

(b)   
     
        The 2005 amount includes
      a $726 million pre-tax gain from Valero's acquisition of Premcor Inc. (Premcor) and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero
      shares received.     

  Occidental s
2007 worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent. The decrease in the income tax rate in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from lower
taxes on the 2007 sale of certain properties.  

  Occidental's
2006 worldwide effective tax rate was 44 percent. The lower income tax rate for reported income in 2005, compared to 2006, resulted
from a $335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit
resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues.  

   CONSOLIDATED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

   Selected
Revenue Items   

The
increase in net sales in 2007, compared to 2006, reflects higher crude oil prices and increased oil and gas production, including
production from the start-up of the Dolphin Project in the third quarter of 2007.  

  The
increase in net sales in 2006, compared to 2005, reflects higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production and higher chemical
prices, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.  

  Interest,
dividends and other income of 2007 includes $112 million of gains from litigation settlements.  

  The
increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2006, compared to 2005, is primarily due to a $108 million gain related to
litigation settlements and interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents.  

  Gains
on disposition of assets, net in 2007, includes a $326 million gain from the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell, a $412 million
gain from the sale of Occidental s interest in a Russian joint venture and a gain of $103 million from the sale of exploration
properties in West Africa.  

  Gains
on disposition of assets, net in 2006, includes a gain of $90 million from the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell
stock.  

  Gains
on disposition of assets, net in 2005 include a gain of $726 million resulting from Valero s acquisition of Premcor and the
subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received and a gain of $140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell
stock.  

   Selected
Expense Items   

Cost
of sales increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher crude oil and natural gas production and maintenance costs and higher
chemicals feedstock costs.  

  Cost
of sales increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher crude oil and natural gas production, maintenance, workover and utility
costs and higher ad valorem and export taxes.  

  Selling,
general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to 2007 severance charges, higher
production taxes and higher stock-based and incentive compensation expense. The increase in stock-based and incentive compensation
expense in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from a 58-percent increase in Occidental's stock price and higher net income, which
increased the performance measures used to value certain of the existing stock-based awards, partially offset by a decrease in the
value of awards granted in 2007.  

  Selling,
general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher crude oil and natural gas
production taxes and increases in stock-based and incentive compensation expense.  

  DD A
increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased production, mainly from the Dolphin Project, and higher costs of new reserve
additions resulting in a higher DD A rate.  

  19  

DD A
increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to increased production, mainly from the Vintage acquisition and higher costs of new
reserve additions resulting in a higher DD A rate.  

  The
increase in exploration expense in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to increases in the Colombia and Middle East/North Africa
exploration programs and impairments in California.  

  Interest
and debt expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005 included pre-tax debt repayment expenses of $167 million, $35 million and $42 million,
respectively. Excluding the effect of these debt repayment charges, interest expense decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to
lower debt levels and lower effective interest rates.  

   Selected
Other Items   

The
increase in the provision for income taxes in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to an increase in income before taxes in
2007.  

  The
increase in the provision for income taxes in 2006, compared to 2005, was due to an increase in income before taxes in 2006, a $335
million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required, and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit related to the
resolution of certain IRS tax issues.  

  The
decrease in income from equity investments in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to the sale of Occidental s interest in Lyondell
and a Russian joint venture.  

  The
decrease in income from equity investments in 2006, compared to 2005, is mainly due to the change in Occidental s accounting
for its Lyondell shares from equity method to available-for-sale investment in May 2006.  

  Discontinued
operations in 2007 include after-tax income of $326 million for the operations of Horn Mountain and Pakistan that were sold as part
of a series of transactions with BP as well as the results of operations of these assets before disposal.  

  Discontinued
operations in 2006 include a $296 million after-tax loss for Ecuador after Occidental's contract for its Block 15 operations was
terminated in May 2006. The 2006 amount also includes $285 million after-tax income for the operations of Horn Mountain and Pakistan
as well as the Vintage assets that were held for sale.  

  Discontinued
operations in 2005 include after-tax income from Ecuador, Horn Mountain and Pakistan operations.  

   CONSOLIDATED
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION   

  The
changes in the following components of Occidental s balance sheet are discussed below:  

   Selected
Balance Sheet Components   

Assets   

  See
"Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents.  

  The
decrease in short-term investments was due to the sale of Occidental's investments in auction rate securities. The increase in trade
receivables, net was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006.
The decrease in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other was due to mark-to-market adjustments on derivative
instruments. The increase in inventories was due to an increase in materials and supplies, mainly in Colombia and Libya, and higher
purchases from third parties in the marketing and trading operations. The increase in prepaid expense and other was due to increases
in current deferred tax assets and higher prepaid insurance premiums. The decrease in assets of discontinued operations was due to
the sale of Pakistan operations and an exchange involving the Horn Mountain operations with BP during 2007.  

  The
decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell and the sale of
Occidental s interest in a Russian joint venture. The increase in property, plant and equipment (PP E), net was due to
capital expenditures in 2007 and various oil and gas acquisitions, offset by 2007 DD A and sales of various oil and gas
assets.  

  20  

Liabilities
and Stockholders' Equity   

  The
increase in accounts payable was due to higher prices and volumes for purchased crude oil and natural gas in the marketing and
trading operations. In 2007, the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to contract bonus payments in Oman, contingent payments
related to acquisitions and 2006 accruals for interest that were paid for in the debt tender offers. The decrease in domestic and
foreign income taxes was due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 48.  

  The
decrease in long-term debt, net was due to the January 2007 debt repurchases under cash tender offers, the May 2007 redemption of
the Vintage senior notes due 2012 and required debt payments. The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities   other
was due to an increase in asset retirement obligations and higher mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments. The decrease
in minority interest was due to Occidental's purchase of the minority interest in a chemical operation from a third
party.  

  The
increase in stockholders' equity reflects net income for 2007 partially offset by treasury stock repurchases of approximately 20.6
million shares in 2007 and dividend payments.  

   LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

  At
December 31, 2007, Occidental had approximately $2.0 billion in cash on hand. Although income and cash flows are largely dependent
on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to
fund its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, anticipated acquisitions, debt payments and purchases
under its announced common stock repurchase program. If needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities.  

  In
September 2006, Occidental amended and restated its $1.5 billion bank credit (Credit Facility) to, among other things, lower the
interest rate and extend the term to September 2011. In September 2007, participating lenders extended the maturity date on $1.4
billion of aggregate loan commitments under the Credit Facility to September 2012. The Credit Facility provides for the termination
of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if
Occidental files for bankruptcy. Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the Credit Facility during 2007. Available but
unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007.  

  None
of Occidental's committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict
Occidental's ability to borrow under these lines. Occidental's credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers
that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade.  

  At
December 31, 2007, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidental's capacity for additional
unsecured borrowing was approximately $54.8 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on,
and for acquisitions of, Occidental's capital stock was approximately $20.8 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and
acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing.  

  In
May 2007, Occidental redeemed all $276 million of the outstanding principal amount of its 8.25-percent Vintage Petroleum, LLC
(Vintage) senior notes due 2012. In January 2007, Occidental completed cash tender offers for its 10.125-percent senior debentures
due 2009, 9.25-percent senior debentures due 2019, 8.75-percent medium-term notes due 2023, 7.2-percent senior debentures due 2028
and 8.45-percent senior notes due 2029, resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling $659 million in
principal amount. The redemption and repurchases resulted in a pre-tax interest expense of $167 million.  

  In
the first quarter of 2005, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of various securities. As of
December 31, 2007, no securities had been issued under this shelf.  

   Cash
Flow Analysis   

The
increase in operating cash flow in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production
partially offset by the effects of lower chemical margins, particularly PVC, and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations. In
2007, Occidental s realized crude oil prices increased 12 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 4 percent
compared to 2006. The increase in production was mainly due to the start-up of the Dolphin Project production in the third quarter
of 2007.  

  Increases
in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility, maintenance and gas plant costs,
partially offset the effect of increases in realized crude oil prices. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are
not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. These
cost increases had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil and natural gas
production.  

  Most
major chemical prices, especially PVC, decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, which reduced chemical margins. The overall impact of
the chemical price decreases on cash flow was much less significant than the increase in crude oil prices because the chemical
segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller that those for the oil and gas segment.  

  The
significant increase in operating cash flow in 2006, compared to 2005, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers
were higher crude oil prices, higher oil and gas production and, to a much lesser extent, higher chemical margins, partially offset
by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from  

  21  

discontinued
operations. In 2006, Occidental s realized crude oil prices increased by 15 percent and its oil and gas production increased by
over 17 percent compared to 2005. The increase in production was mainly due to the 11 months of production from the Vintage
acquisition.  

  Increases
in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility costs, gas plant costs and ad
valorem and export taxes, partially offset the effect of oil price increases. The cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow
than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production.  

  Most
major chemical prices increased in 2006, compared to 2005, at a higher rate than ethylene costs, thereby improving chemical margins.
The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical
segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment.  

  Other
non-cash charges to income in 2007 included deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental
remediation accruals. Other non-cash charges to income in 2006 included stock incentive plan amortization, deferred compensation and
environmental remediation accruals. Other non-cash charges to income in 2005 included chemical asset write-downs, deferred
compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals.  

The
2007 amount includes cash proceeds of $672 million from the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell, $485 million received from the
sale of Occidental s interest in a Russian joint venture, $509 million from the sale of other businesses and properties, and
$250 million from the sale of auction rate securities. The 2007 amount also includes the cash paid for the acquisitions of various
oil and gas and chemical interests, a Permian Basin common carrier pipeline system and a gas processing plant in Texas totaling $1.4
billion.  

  The
2006 amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of Vintage and the property acquisition from Plains,
partially offset by cash proceeds from the Vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of Lyondell shares.  

  The
2005 amount includes the cash payments for several Permian Basin acquisitions, the acquisition of the Vulcan chlor-alkali
manufacturing facilities and the payments to re-enter Libya and to assume operations of the Mukhaizna field in Oman. These were
partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the Premcor-Valero shares and the Lyondell shares.  

  Also,
see the "Capital Expenditures" section below.  

The
2007 amount includes net debt payments of $1.2 billion, including the repurchase of various debt issues under cash tender offers and
the redemption of the Vintage senior notes due 2012. The 2007 amount also included $1.1 billion of cash paid for repurchases of 20.6
million shares of Occidental s common stock at an average price of $54.75 per share.  

  The
2006 amount consists of $1.5 billion of cash paid for Occidental s stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately
$900 million.  

  The
2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately $900 million.  

  Occidental
paid common stock dividends of $765 million in 2007, $646 million in 2006 and $483 million in 2005.  

   Capital
Expenditures   

(a)   
     
        Excludes acquisitions.
      Amounts are included in net cash used by investing activities discussed above.     

  Occidental s
capital spending estimate for 2008 is approximately $3.8 to $3.9 billion. Most of the capital spending increase will be allocated to
oil and gas exploration, production and development activities for the Colombia LCI project and the Vintage properties in Argentina
and California.  

  Commitments
at December 31, 2007, for major capital expenditures during 2008 and thereafter were approximately $330 million. Occidental will
fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.  

   OFF-BALANCE-SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS   

  In
the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business
objectives.  The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding
employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are
recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on
Occidental s balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these
transactions.  

   Dolphin
Project   

  See
"Oil and Gas Segment   Business Review   Middle East/North Africa   Dolphin Project" for further information about
the structure of the Dolphin Project.  

  In
July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to
pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project.  

  22  

The
new bridge loan has a term of four years, is a revolving credit facility through April 2008 and may be converted to a term loan
thereafter. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion facility to fund the
construction of a certain portion of the Dolphin Project. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin
Energy. At December 31, 2007, Occidental s portion of the bridge loan and financing facility was $816 million. Occidental had
recorded $588 million on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, for the combined bridge loan and financing facility. The remaining
amounts of the bridge loan and financing facility drawdowns are discussed in the "Guarantees" section below.  

   Ecuador   

  In
Ecuador, Occidental has a 14-percent interest in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline. As of December 31,
2007, Occidental s net investment in and advances to the project totaled $69 million. Occidental reports this investment in its
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt,
which is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship-or-pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador. In May 2006, Ecuador
terminated Occidental s contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil-producing operations in the
country, and seized Occidental s Block 15 assets. Occidental s guarantee of its share of the ship-or-pay obligations
provides the lenders the right to require Occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation, which has
not been exercised to date. At December 31, 2007, the total pre-tax advance tariff of approximately $89 million was accrued in
Occidental s consolidated financial statements. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay
project debt. At December 31, 2007, Occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling $14 million.  

   Leases   

  Occidental
has entered into various operating-lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space.
Occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. For more
information, see the Contractual Obligations table below.  

   Guarantees   

  Occidental
has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of
guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will
meet their various obligations (guarantees).  

  At
December 31, 2007, the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of FIN 45 was approximately
$250 million, which consists of Occidental s guarantee of equity investees  debt, primarily from the Dolphin Project
equity investment, and other commitments.  

   Contractual
Obligations   

  The
table below summarizes and cross-references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of December 31, 2007 and/or disclosed in the accompanying Notes.  

(a)   
     
        Excludes unamortized
      debt discount and interest expense on the debt. As of December 31, 2007, interest on long-term debt totaling $767 million is
      payable in the following years (in millions): 2008 - $105, 2009 to 2010 - $149, 2011 to 2012 - $112 and 2013 and thereafter -
      $401.    

(b)   
     
        Includes accounts
      payable, certain accrued liabilities and obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation
      plans.    

(c)   
     
        Amounts have not been
      reduced for sublease rental income.    

(d)   
     
        Includes long-term
      purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in
      the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take-or-pay commitments but they do not represent debt
      obligations. Long-term material purchase contracts are discounted using a 6.4-percent discount rate.    

(e)   
     
        Amounts exclude purchase
      obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position
      exists.     

   LAWSUITS,
CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS   

  OPC
or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other
things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for
alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these
proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all
such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

  23  

Since
2004, Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) has been served with ten lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,600 individual
plaintiffs. These individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of
their alleged exposure to a pesticide. OCC is aware of, but has not been served in, 23 additional cases in Nicaragua, which
Occidental understands make similar allegations. In the opinion of management, the claims against OCC are without merit because,
among other things, OCC believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the applicable
Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre-trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from
participating fully in their defense. OCC filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre-trial
deposit. In 2004, the judge in one of the cases (Osorio case) ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OCC,
 and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre-trial deposit. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OCC
elected not to make a substantive appearance in the Osorio case. In 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against
several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In December 2006, the court in a second case in
Nicaragua (Rios case) entered a judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $800 million.
While preserving its jurisdictional defenses, OCC has appealed the judgments in the Osorio and Rios cases. In September 2007, the
plaintiffs in the Osorio case filed an action in state court in Florida seeking to enforce the Nicaraguan judgment. That action was
removed to and is presently pending in federal court. OCC has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, any judgment
rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio and Rios cases, would be unenforceable in the United States.  

  During
the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for U.S. federal and state corporate income tax
purposes. Corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through the current year are in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law.  

  Occidental
has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical
power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2007, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion
of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $52
million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2008   $12, 2009   $10, 2010   $10, 2011   $9, 2012  
$8 and thereafter   $3. Fixed payments under these agreements were $18 million in 2007, $18 million in 2006 and $17 million in
2005. See "Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements   Contractual Obligations" for further information.  

  Occidental
has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services
at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. See "Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements" for further information.
Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.8 to $3.9 billion
in capital expenditures estimated for 2008.  

  Occidental
has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with
purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental.  These indemnities usually are contingent upon the
other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2007, Occidental is not aware of circumstances
that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions
that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.  

  It
is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any
lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities. If
these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidental s reserves, an outcome
not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidental s consolidated
financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidental s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.  

   ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES   

  Occidental s
operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining
environmental quality. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the
future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are
considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand.  

   Environmental
Remediation   

  The
laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of
substances to the environment. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current
ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in environmental assessments and cleanups under these
laws at currently-owned facilities, previously-owned sites and third-party sites. Also, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been
involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including,
in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive
damages and civil penalties.  

  24  

As
of December 31, 2007, Occidental, through a wholly owed subsidiary, participated in or monitored ongoing or recent assessments,
remediation, proceedings or information requests at 163 sites.  Thirty-nine of those sites are currently listed or proposed for
listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the National Priorities List.  

  The
following table presents Occidental s environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, grouped by three
categories of environmental remediation sites:  

The
following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:  

Occidental
expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next four years and the balance over
the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities
beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental
remediation matters could be up to $400 million beyond the amount accrued.  

  For
management s opinion with respect to environmental matters, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and
Related Matters" section above.  

    CERCLA
and Equivalent Sites    

  As
of December 31, 2007, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 CERCLA or equivalent proceedings, as shown
below.  

(a)   
     
        Includes 30 sites for
      which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 6 sites where Occidental has denied
      liability without challenge, 31 sites where Occidental s reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 18 sites where reserves
      are between $50,000 and $1 million each.     

  The
six sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2007 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two
closed landfills in western New York and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan,
western New York and Tacoma, Washington).  

    Active
Facilities    

  Certain
subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 17 active facilities. Four assets  
a chemical plant in Louisiana, a chemical plant in Kansas and certain oil and gas properties and pipeline systems in the
southwestern United States   account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities.  

    Closed
or Sold Facilities    

  There
are 41 other sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation
requirements in which OPC or its subsidiaries are involved.  Four sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this
group. The four sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain
remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a
former phosphorous processing and recovery facility in Tennessee.  

   Environmental
Costs   

  Occidental s
costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each
segment:  

Operating
expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating
facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future
revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures
for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase.  

  Occidental
presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $91 million for 2008 and $93
million for 2009.  

  25  

FOREIGN
INVESTMENTS   

  Portions
of Occidental s assets are located outside of North America. At December 31, 2007, the carrying value of Occidental s
assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $10.0 billion, or approximately 28 percent of Occidental s
total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $5.9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately
$4.1 billion are located in Latin America. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net sales outside North America totaled $6.3
billion, or approximately 33 percent of total net sales.  

   CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

  The
process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and
judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these
estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the
following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidental s management. There
has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting
policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

   Oil
and Gas Properties   

  Occidental
uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties,
costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially
capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs
of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have
been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved
reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental's
practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a
twelve-month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of
commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.  

  Annual
lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.  

  Proved
oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data
demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions considering future production and development costs.  

  Several
factors could change Occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover
its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when
oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is
greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where
production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change
partially due to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs.
These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. An additional factor that could result in
a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded.
Occidental's revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2007 and amounted to approximately 3 percent of the total reserves for
the year. Occidental s revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2006 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total
reserves for the year. In 2005, revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves
for the year. Occidental's revisions to proved reserves have been positive for seven of the last ten years. Additionally, Occidental
is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, generally when
prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact the
ability to realize the recorded asset amounts.  

  If
Occidental s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact
would be on the DD A rate. For example, a 5-percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the
rate from $9.61 per barrel to $9.13 per barrel, which would increase pre-tax income by $100 million annually. A 5-percent decrease
in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $9.61 per barrel to $10.09 per barrel and would result in a decrease in
pre-tax income of $100 million annually.  

  DD A
of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated
proved reserves. The change in the DD A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has
been immaterial.  

  A
portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31,
2007, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $1.4 billion. The
unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves. As
exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the
properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the
capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was
made. The timing of any  

  26  

writedowns
of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development
activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved
property balance.  

   Chemical
Assets   

  The
most critical accounting policy affecting Occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of
its PP E. Occidental's chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon
the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from 3
years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used
for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to
ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly
decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher
or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices,
environmental regulations and technological changes.  

  Occidental
performs impairment tests on its assets, per SFAS No. 144, whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the
estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when
management s plans change with respect to those assets.  

  Occidental's
net PP E for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately $320
million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above,
the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year
would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $16 million per year.  

   Environmental
Liabilities and Expenditures   

  Environmental
expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate
to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded
when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the
reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience,
available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost-sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are
based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional
or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially
established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably
determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental has not accrued any
reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets.  

  Many
factors could result in changes to Occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most
significant are:  

The
      original cost estimate may have been inaccurate.    

Modified
      remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the
      remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective.
      Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto-remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or
      in-situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more
      intensive or costly measures may be required.    

The
      remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction.
      Site-specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology,
      interactions between or among water-bearing zones and non-water-bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control
      contaminant sources.    

The
      regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different
      course of action.     

  Additionally,
other events might occur that could affect Occidental s future remediation costs, such as:  

The
      discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater,
      accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants
      may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area
      requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
      measures.    

Improved
      remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected
      long-term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and
      more cost-effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation
      costs.    

Laws
      and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements.     

  27  

At
sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other
parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the
consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially
responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on
Occidental s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  

  Most
cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories:  

   Category
1:   CERCLA or equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of
remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations;  

   Category
2:   Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost;
or  

   Category
3:   Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the
transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation.  

  In
all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by
recognition for any nonperforming parties.  

  In
addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites,
Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the
extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations,
technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site-specific basis.  

  If
the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the
increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10
percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $46 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental
would record an additional remediation expense of $46 million.  

   Other
Loss Contingencies   

  Occidental
is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss
contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount
recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet.  

  These
reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as
appropriate. Management s judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in
management s plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors.  

   SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING CHANGES   

  Listed
below are significant changes in accounting principles.  

   Future
Accounting Changes   

    SFAS
No. 157    

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007.  Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 157 on its financial
statements.  

    SFAS
No. 159    

  In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." This statement
provides entities the option to measure certain financial instruments at fair value.  SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 159
on its financial statements.  

    EITF
Issue No. 07-1    

  In
December 2007, the FASB finalized the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-1, "Accounting for
Collaborative Arrangements." This EITF Issue provides guidance and requires financial statement disclosures for collaborative
arrangements. EITF Issue No. 07-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 07-1 on its financial statements but it is not expected to be
material.  

    SFAS
No. 141(R)    

  In
December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure
requirements for business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations which occur in the first fiscal year
beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  

    SFAS
No. 160    

  In
December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements   an amendment of ARB
No. 51." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests
in a subsidiary.  SFAS No. 160 is effective for the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Occidental is
currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 160 on its financial statements.  

  28  

Recently
Adopted Accounting Changes   

    FIN
No. 48    

  In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."
This interpretation specifies that benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority having full knowledge
of all relevant information. A tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured at the largest
amount of benefit for which the likelihood of realization upon ultimate settlement exceeds 50 percent. Occidental adopted FIN No. 48
on January 1, 2007.  

  The
following table shows the effect of adopting FIN No. 48 on the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2007 (in
millions):

    FSP
AUG AIR-1    

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities," which is
effective for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of
accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which was used by certain operations of Occidental. When Occidental adopted FSP
AUG AIR-1 on January 1, 2007, those operations changed to the deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance
activities. The adoption of FSP AUG AIR-1 was retrospectively applied to all periods presented and the impact to the income
statements for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was immaterial.  

  The

    SFAS
No. 158    

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." This statement requires an employer to recognize the
overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability and recognize
changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (OCI), if they
are not recognized in the income statement. The statement also requires a company to use the date of its fiscal year-end to measure
the plans. The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006.
The requirement to use the fiscal year-end as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
Occidental adopted this statement on December 31, 2006, and recorded an additional liability of $233 million and a reduction of
accumulated OCI, deferred tax liabilities, other assets and minority interest of $168 million, $104 million, $42 million and $3
million, respectively.  

   DERIVATIVE
ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK   

   General   

  Occidental's
market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices. Occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce
these price fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another
instrument or variable.  

  In
general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or
similar valuation models.  

   Commodity
Price Risk   

    General    

  Occidental s
results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary
overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre-tax income of approximately $151 million. If domestic
natural gas prices vary by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre-tax income of approximately $96 million.
If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would
change.  

  Occidental s
results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices; however, changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price
changes on margins. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of
approximately $15 million and $30 million, respectively. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have a pre-tax annual effect on
income of approximately $30 million. If ethylene dichloride (EDC) prices vary by $10/ton, it would have a pre-tax annual effect on
income of approximately $5 million. Historically, product price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock product
price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc.,
December 2007 average contract prices were: chlorine $323/ton, caustic soda $498/ton, PVC $0.67/lb and
EDC $310/ton.  

    Marketing
and Trading Operations    

  Occidental
periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives have been used
by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity-related cash flows. Occidental
enters into low-risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established
policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a  

  29  

combination
of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidental's use of derivatives in marketing and
trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third-party purchases, which includes Occidental s periodic
gas storage activities.  

    Risk
Management    

  Occidental
conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging
activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Control Policy. The President and Chief Financial Officer and the Risk
Management Committee, comprising members of Occidental's management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by
the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and
trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on trading,
segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls.

      into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value.     

    Production
Hedges    

  In
2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and collar agreements that qualify as cash-flow hedges for the sale of a
portion of its crude oil production. Additionally, Occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the Vintage
acquisition. The fixed price swaps and the basis swaps expired in 2007. The collar agreements continue to the end of 2011. The 2007
volume that was hedged was less than 3 percent of Occidental s 2007 crude oil and natural gas production. Information about
these cash-flow hedges, which are included in the total fair value of ($576) million in the table above, is presented in a tabular
presentation below as of December 31, 2007 (volumes in thousands of barrels):

Quantitative
Information    

  Occidental
uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based derivatives and commodity
contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair
value with a 95-percent level of confidence. The marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2007.  

   Interest
Rate Risk   

    General    

  Occidental's
exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its
interest-rate swaps that were accounted for as fair-value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion
of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20
million, which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006. The amount of interest expense recorded in the
income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain, by approximately $13 million and $21 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

   Credit
Risk   

  Occidental s
energy contracts are spread among several counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty
and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits. Credit exposure for each
customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure. Losses associated with
credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented.  

   Foreign
Currency Risk   

  A
few of Occidental s foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary
assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most
international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and
gas subsidiaries have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental had not entered into any
foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic
income and is immaterial.

   MANAGEMENT'S
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   

  The
management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Occidental s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental s assets; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that Occidental s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of Occidental s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.  

  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

  Management
has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental s internal control system as of December 31, 2007 based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as
of December 31, 2007, Occidental s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.  

  Occidental s
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an attestation report on Occidental s internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders  

  Occidental
Petroleum Corporation:  

  We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders  equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.  

  In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.  

  As
explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company changed its method of
accounting for uncertain tax positions; effective December 31, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans; and effective July 1, 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for
share-based payments.  

  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Occidental
Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   

  To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders  

  Occidental
Petroleum Corporation:  

  We
have audited Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management s Annual Assessment of and Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  

  We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

  A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

  In
our opinion, Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  

  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders  equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

   NOTE
1    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

   NATURE
OF OPERATIONS   

  In
this report, the term "Occidental" or "the Company" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and/or one or more entities
where it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is a multinational organization whose principal business
segments are operated by its oil and gas subsidiaries and affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and affiliates. The subsidiaries and
other affiliates in the oil and gas segment explore for, develop, produce and market crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and
natural gas. The subsidiaries and other affiliates in the chemical segment (OxyChem) manufacture and market basic chemicals, vinyls
and performance chemicals.  

  On
August 1, 2006, Occidental effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of that
date with distribution of the shares on August 15, 2006. The total number of authorized shares of common stock and associated par
value per share were unchanged by this action. All share and per-share amounts discussed and disclosed in this Annual Report on Form
10-K reflect the effect of the stock split.  

   PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION   

  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OPC, its subsidiaries, variable-interest entities (VIE) in which it is the
primary beneficiary and its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures. Occidental's proportionate share
of oil and gas exploration and production ventures, in which it has a direct working interest, is accounted for by reporting its
proportionate share of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets, income
statements and cash flow statements.  

  In
addition, certain financial statements, notes and supplementary data for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
presentation.  

   INVESTMENTS
IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES   

  Investments
in unconsolidated entities include both equity method and available-for-sale investments. Amounts representing Occidental s
percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates (excluding undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and
production ventures) in which it does not have a majority voting interest but as to which it exercises significant influence, are
accounted for under the equity method. Occidental reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount of impairment, if any, is based on
quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.  

  Investments
in which Occidental does not exercise significant influence are accounted for as available-for-sale investments and are carried at
fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of
taxes, until such investment is realized. Upon disposal, the accumulated unrealized gain or loss included in OCI is transferred to
income.  

   REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

  Revenue
is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue
from marketing and trading activities is recognized on settled transactions upon completion of contract terms, and for physical
deliveries upon title transfer. For unsettled transactions, contracts that meet specified accounting criteria are marked-to-market.
Revenue from all marketing and trading activities, including revenue from buy/sell arrangements with the same counterparty, is
reported on a net basis.  

  Revenue
from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer. Prices are fixed at the
time of shipment. Certain incentive programs may provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of
product purchased over a defined period. Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a
reduction to revenue ratably over the contract period. Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.  

  Occidental
records revenue net of taxes that are assessed by governmental authorities on Occidental's customers.  

   RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES   

  The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such
estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts, but generally not by material amounts. Management
believes that these estimates and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental s financial
position and results of operations.  

  40  

Included
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2007, the noncurrent
portion of which is netted against deferred income tax liabilities. Realization of these assets is dependent upon Occidental
generating sufficient future taxable income. Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets through future operating
income and reversal of temporary differences.  

  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2007, and net sales
of approximately $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, relating to Occidental s operations in countries outside
North America. Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political
instability, armed conflict, civil unrest, security problems, restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that
prevent continued operations, all of which increase Occidental's risk of loss or delayed or restricted production or may result in
other adverse consequences. Occidental attempts to conduct its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against such risks
and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization.  

  Since
Occidental s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a
significant impact on Occidental s results of operations for any particular year.  

  Also,
see "Property, Plant and Equipment" below.  

   CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   

  Cash
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash. Cash equivalents totaled approximately
$2.0 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

   SHORT-TERM
INVESTMENTS   

  Occidental s
short-term investments consist of highly liquid debt securities (auction-rate securities) classified as available-for-sale.
Short-term investments are marked-to-market with any unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income/loss (AOCI). Occidental sold all of its short-term investments in 2007.  

   INVENTORIES   

  For
the oil and gas segment, materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Inventories are reviewed
periodically for obsolescence. Crude oil and NGLs inventories and natural gas trading and storage inventory are valued at the lower
of cost or market.  

  For
the chemical segment, Occidental generally values its inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches
current costs and current revenue. Accordingly, Occidental accounts for most of its domestic inventories in its chemical business,
other than materials and supplies, on the LIFO method. For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
(if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically
identifiable). Occidental accounts for materials and supplies using a weighted average cost method.  

   PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   

   Oil
and Gas   

  Property
additions and major renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital
expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets (see Note 16).  

  Occidental
uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties,
costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially
capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs
of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have
been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved
reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental's
practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a
twelve-month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of
commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and geological,
geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.  

  The
following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for the past three years:  

41  

Proved
oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data
demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions considering future production and development costs. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is
determined by the unit-of-production method.  

  The
carrying value of Occidental s property, plant and equipment (PP E) is based on the cost incurred to acquire the PP E,
net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) and net of any impairment charges. For acquisitions of a
business, PP E cost is determined by an allocation of total purchase price to the components of PP E based on their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets. Occidental
assesses assets for impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. Impaired assets are
written down to their estimated fair values, generally their estimated discounted future net pre-tax cash flows.  

  A
portion of the carrying value of Occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31,
2007, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $1.4 billion. During 2007, approximately $190 million of
the unproved property amount was moved to proved properties. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD A or impairment until a
determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves. As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these
properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the
exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work
would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if
warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental
believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance.  

   Chemical   

  Occidental s
chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful life of
the facilities.  

  The
estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation
expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the
assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change
the estimated useful lives of Occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are
particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and
technological changes.  

  Occidental
performs impairment tests on its assets, per Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, whenever events or changes
in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management s plans change with respect to those assets.  

  In
2005, subsequent to the purchase of the Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan) chemical assets, Occidental reviewed all of its chemical
assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations. As a result of this review,
Occidental recorded a $139 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of two previously idled chemical plants and one operating plant
and an additional pre-tax charge of $20 million for the write-down of another chemical plant in 2005.  

   ACCRUED
LIABILITIES   CURRENT   

  Accrued
liabilities include accrued payroll, commissions and related expenses of $288 million and $277 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  

   ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES   

  Environmental
expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate
to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded
when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the
reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience,
available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost-sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are
based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional
or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially
established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably
determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental has not accrued any
reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets.  

  42  

Many
factors could result in changes to Occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most
significant are:  

The
      original cost estimate may have been inaccurate.    

Modified
      remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the
      remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective.
      Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto-remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or
      in-situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more
      intensive or costly measures may be required.    

The
      remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction.
      Site-specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology,
      interactions between or among water-bearing zones and non-water-bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control
      contaminant sources.    

The
      regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different
      course of action.     

  Additionally,
other events might occur that could affect Occidental s future remediation costs, such as:  

The
      discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater,
      accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants
      may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area
      requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
      measures.    

Improved
      remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected
      long-term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and
      more cost-effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation
      costs.    

Laws
      and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements.     

  At
sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other
parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the
consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially
responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on
Occidental s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  

  Most
cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories:  

   Category
1 : Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or equivalent sites wherein Occidental and
other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed
allocations;  

   Category
2 : Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; or  

   Category
3 : Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree
to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation.  

  In
all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by
recognition for any nonperforming parties.  

  In
addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites,
Occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the
extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations,
technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site-specific basis.  

   ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS   

  In
the period in which an asset retirement obligation is incurred or becomes reasonably estimable, Occidental recognizes the fair value
of the liability if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its
useful life. The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as expected
economic recoveries of oil and gas, time to abandonment, future inflation rates and the adjusted risk-free rate of interest. When
the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP E balances. Over time, the
liability is increased and expense is recognized for the change in its present value, and the initial capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the asset. No market risk premium has been included in Occidental s liability since no
reliable estimate can be made at this time.  

  43  

Occidental
has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are related mainly to plant
decommissioning. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, which Occidental adopted on December
31, 2005, Occidental was required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they could be reasonably estimated.
However, Occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range
of time over which Occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, Occidental cannot
reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities. Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in
the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.  

  The
following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $445 million and $346 million is included in
deferred credits and other liabilities - other, with the remaining current portion in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  

DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS   

  All
derivative instruments required to be marked-to-market under SFAS No. 133, as amended, are carried at fair value. Cash flow hedge
realized gains and losses, and any ineffectiveness, are classified within the net sales line item. Gains and losses are netted in
the income statement and are netted on the balance sheets when a right of offset exists.  

  Occidental
applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for hedge accounting treatment. If
the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings.
If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting and is designated and documented as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
either recognized in income with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged for fair value hedges, or deferred
in OCI to the extent the hedge is effective for cash flow hedges.  

  A
hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected
that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes
in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 to 125 percent. In the case of hedging a
forecasted transaction, the transaction must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could
ultimately affect reported net income or loss. Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has
ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; when the hedged item
matures or is sold or repaid; when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed highly probable; or when the derivative is no longer
designated as a hedge.  

   FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE   

  Occidental
values financial instruments as required by SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments." The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying value
of other on-balance-sheet financial instruments, other than fixed-rate debt, approximates fair value, and the cost, if any, to
terminate off-balance-sheet financial instruments is not significant.  

   STOCK-BASED
INCENTIVE PLANS   

  Occidental
has established several shareholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees (Plans) that are more fully described
in Note 12. Beginning July 1, 2005, Occidental accounted for those Plans under SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payments." Prior to
July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
intrinsic value accounting method for its stock-based incentive plans. A summary of Occidental s accounting policy under each
method follows below.  

   SFAS
No. 123(R)   

  For
restricted stock units (RSUs), performance restricted share units (PRSUs) and cash-settled share units (CSSUs), compensation expense
is measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental s common stock. For stock options (Options),
stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), performance stock awards (PSAs) and total shareholder return incentives (TSRIs),
compensation expense is measured on the grant date using valuation models. Compensation expense for RSUs, PRSUs, Options,
stock-settled SARs, CSSUs, PSAs and TSRIs, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is
generally over the awards  respective vesting or performance periods. For the PSAs and TSRIs, every quarter until vesting, the
cash-settled portion is revalued using valuation models and the stock-settled portion is adjusted for any change in the number of
shares  

  44  

expected
to be issued based on the performance criteria. For the PRSUs, compensation expense is adjusted for any change in the number of
shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria. For CSSUs, changes in fair value of the market price of Occidental
common stock between the grant date and the date of vesting are recognized as compensation expense. For cash-settled SARs issued
prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), compensation expense is initially measured on the grant date using a valuation model and then
is recorded on the accelerated amortization method over the vesting period. Changes in the fair value between the date of grant and
the date when the cash-settled SARs are exercised are recognized as compensation expense. Occidental recognizes compensation expense
for all graded vesting awards issued subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on the straight-line method.  

   APB
Opinion No. 25   

  Through
June 30, 2005, compensation expense for Options and RSUs, if any, was measured as the difference between the quoted market price of
Occidental's stock at the grant date, less the amount that the employee must pay to acquire the stock. Any compensation expense for
these awards was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the respective awards. For PSAs, compensation
expense was measured for each period based on the number of shares expected to vest and the changes in the quoted market value of
Occidental's stock during the vesting period. Compensation expense or benefit for PSAs, as applicable, was recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the awards. Compensation expense for SARs, which was recorded on the accelerated
amortization method over the vesting period, was measured as the amount by which the quoted market value of Occidental's stock
exceeded the SAR exercise price. The effect of changes in Occidental's share price between the date of grant and the date when the
SARs were exercised or expired was recognized as compensation expense in each period.  

   SUPPLEMENTAL
CASH FLOW INFORMATION   

  Cash
payments for continuing operations, net of refunds, during the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 included federal, foreign and state income
taxes of approximately $2.177 billion, $2.130 billion and $1.736 billion, respectively. Net cash payments for federal, foreign and
state income taxes paid by discontinued operations during the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $17 million, $102 million and $108
million, respectively. Interest paid (net of interest capitalized) totaled approximately $248 million, $211 million and $253 million
for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (See Note 2 for detail of noncash investing and financing activities regarding
certain acquisitions.)  

   FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS   

  The
functional currency applicable to all of Occidental s foreign oil and gas operations is the U.S. dollar since cash flows are
denominated principally in U.S. dollars. Occidental s chemical operations in Brazil use the Real as the functional currency.
Exchange-rate changes on transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies generated losses of $18 million in 2007,
zero in 2006 and $9 million in 2005.  

   NOTE
2    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS   

   2007   

  In
January 2007, Occidental sold its 50-percent joint venture interest in Russia for an after-tax gain of approximately $412
million.  

  In
June 2007, Occidental completed a fair value exchange under which BP p.l.c. (BP) acquired Occidental's oil and gas interests in Horn
Mountain and received cash. Occidental acquired oil and gas interests in the Permian Basin and a gas processing plant in Texas from
BP. Occidental also purchased for cash BP's west Texas pipeline system and, in a separate transaction, Occidental sold its oil and
gas interests in Pakistan to BP. As a result of these transactions, both the Horn Mountain and Pakistan operations were classified
as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Net revenues and pre-tax income for discontinued operations related to
Pakistan and Horn Mountain were $193 million and $469 million (including after-tax disposal gains of $230 million) in 2007, $486
million and $359 million in 2006 and $444 million and $306 million in 2005. The assets and liabilities of Horn Mountain and Pakistan
are classified as assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet. At
December 31, 2006, asset and liabilities of discontinued operations related to Horn Mountain and Pakistan were $162 million and $14
million, respectively, which were mainly comprised of PP E and asset retirement obligations.  

  In
September 2007, Occidental sold exploration properties in West Africa and recorded a pre-tax gain of $103 million.  

   2006   

  In
January 2006, Occidental completed the merger of Vintage into a wholly owned Occidental subsidiary. As a result, Occidental acquired
assets in Argentina, California, Yemen, Bolivia and the Permian Basin in Texas. Occidental paid approximately $1.3 billion in cash
to former Vintage shareholders, issued approximately 56 million shares of Occidental common stock, which were valued at $2.1
billion, and assumed Vintage s debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing.  

  45  

The
acquisition was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." The results of Vintage s
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since January 30, 2006. The assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of PP E consisted of $3.4
billion of proved properties and $1.3 billion of unproved properties. No goodwill was recorded on this transaction. The following
table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to Vintage s assets and liabilities:  

Certain
Vintage assets and their related liabilities were classified as held for sale as part of the allocation of the purchase price as
Occidental intended at the time of acquisition to divest these assets, which were subsequently sold in 2006 for $1.0 billion with no
gain or loss recorded. The results of operations for the assets that were held for sale and sold are not included in the revenue,
cost or production amounts and were treated as discontinued operations. Net revenues and pre-tax income for discontinued operations
related to these Vintage assets for the year ended December 31, 2006, were $869 million and $237 million, respectively.  

  The
following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition of Vintage had occurred
at the beginning of each year:  

The
unaudited pro forma data presented above use estimates and assumptions based on information currently available, and are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations of Occidental that would have occurred had such acquisition actually been
consummated as of the beginning of the years presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of
operations.  

  In
May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidental's contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil producing
operations in the country, and seized Occidental's Block 15 assets. As a result of the seizure, Occidental classified its Block 15
operations as discontinued operations. In 2006, Occidental recorded a net after-tax charge of $296 million in discontinued
operations. This amount consists of after-tax charges for the write-off of the investment in Block 15 in Ecuador, as well as
ship-or-pay obligations entered into with respect to the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) pipeline in Ecuador to ship oil
produced in Block 15, partially offset by $109 million after-tax income from operations for the first five months of
2006.  

  Occidental s
Block 15 assets and liabilities are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance
sheet on a retrospective application basis. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, liabilities of discontinued operations related to Ecuador
were $292 million and $321 million, respectively, which mainly consisted of the ship or pay obligations to the OCP pipeline. Net
revenues and pre-tax income (loss) for discontinued operations related to Ecuador for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
were $275 million and $(529) million, including a pre-tax write-off of $(673) million, and $611 million and $325 million,
respectively.  

  In
September 2006, Occidental acquired oil and gas assets located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and California from Plains
Exploration and Production Co. (Plains) for approximately $859 million in cash.  

  46  

2005   

  In
2005, Occidental made several oil and gas producing property acquisitions in the Permian Basin for approximately $1.7 billion in
cash. This was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling $171 million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired properties. No
gain or loss was recorded for these dispositions.  

  In
2005, Occidental signed an agreement with the Libya National Oil Corporation which allowed it to re-enter the country and
participate in exploration and production operations in the Sirte Basin, which it left in 1986 pursuant to United States law. This
re-entry agreement allowed Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were
suspended. Occidental s rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010.  

  In
July 2005, Occidental signed a new production-sharing contract (PSC) for the Mukhaizna oil field with the Government of the
Sultanate of Oman. Under the terms of the new PSC, Occidental took over field operations on September 1, 2005, for a cost of $137
million. Occidental holds a 45-percent working interest.  

  In
June 2005, Occidental completed the purchase of three basic chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan for $214 million in cash,
plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities. In order
to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition, Occidental divested one of the facilities.  

   NOTE
3    ACCOUNTING CHANGES   

   FUTURE
ACCOUNTING CHANGES   

   SFAS
No. 157   

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements."  This statement establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 157 on its financial
statements.  

   SFAS
No. 159   

  In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." This statement
provides entities the option to measure certain financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 159
on its financial statements.  

   EITF
Issue No. 07-1   

  In
December 2007, the FASB finalized the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07-1, "Accounting for
Collaborative Arrangements."  This EITF Issue provides guidance and requires financial statement disclosures for collaborative
arrangements. EITF Issue No. 07-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 07-1 on its financial statements but it is not expected to be
material.  

   SFAS
No. 141(R)   

  In
December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure
requirements for business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations which occur in the first fiscal year
beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  

   SFAS
No. 160   

  In
December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements   an amendment of ARB
No. 51." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests
in a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Occidental is
currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 160 on its financial statements.  

   RECENTLY
ADOPTED ACCOUNTING CHANGES   

   FIN
No. 48   

  In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."
This interpretation specifies that benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority having full knowledge
of all relevant information. A tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured at the largest
amount of benefit for which the likelihood of realization upon ultimate settlement exceeds 50 percent. Occidental adopted FIN No. 48
on January 1, 2007. See Note 10 for further information.  

  47  

FSP
AUG AIR-1   

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities," which is
effective for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of
accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which was used by certain operations of Occidental. When Occidental adopted FSP
AUG AIR-1 on January 1, 2007, those operations changed to the deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance
activities. The adoption of FSP AUG AIR-1 was retrospectively applied to all periods presented and the impact to the income
statements for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was immaterial.  

  The

   SFAS
No. 158   

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)."  This statement requires an employer to recognize the
overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability and recognize
changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (OCI), if they
are not recognized in the income statement. The statement also requires a company to use the date of its fiscal year-end to measure
the plans. The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006.
The requirement to use the fiscal year-end as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
Occidental adopted this statement on December 31, 2006, and recorded an additional liability of $233 million and a reduction of
accumulated OCI, deferred tax liabilities, other assets and minority interest of $168 million, $104 million, $42 million and $3
million, respectively.  

   NOTE
4    INVENTORIES   

  Inventories
of approximately $190 million and $204 million were valued under the LIFO method at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Inventories consisted of the following:  

48  

NOTE
5    LONG-TERM DEBT   

  Long-term
debt consisted of the following:  

(a)   
     
        The Dolphin Energy Ltd.
      loans include Occidental s portion of the bridge loan and financing facility.     

  In
September 2006, Occidental amended and restated its $1.5 billion bank credit (Credit Facility) to, among other things, lower the
interest rate and extend the term to September 2011. In September 2007, participating lenders extended the maturity date on $1.4
billion of aggregate loan commitments under the Credit Facility to September 2012. The Credit Facility provides for the termination
of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if
Occidental files for bankruptcy. Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the Credit Facility during 2007. Available but
unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007.  

  None
of Occidental's committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict
Occidental's ability to borrow under these lines. Occidental's credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers
that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade. Up to $350 million of the Credit
Facility is available in the form of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various benchmark
rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings. Additionally, Occidental paid an annual facility
fee of 0.06 percent in 2007 on the total commitment amount, which was based on Occidental's senior debt ratings.  

  In
May 2007, Occidental redeemed all $276 million outstanding principal amount of its 8.25-percent Vintage Petroleum, LLC (Vintage)
senior notes due 2012. In January 2007, Occidental completed cash tender offers for its 10.125-percent senior debentures due 2009,
9.25-percent senior debentures due 2019, 8.75-percent medium-term notes due 2023, 7.2-percent senior debentures due 2028 and
8.45-percent senior notes due 2029, resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling $659 million in
principal amount. The redemption and repurchases resulted in a pre-tax interest expense of $167 million.  

  In
2006, Occidental recorded $35 million of pre-tax charges to redeem all of its outstanding 7.375-percent senior notes due 2008 and
all of its 7.875-percent Vintage senior subordinated notes due 2011 and to purchase in the open market and retire various amounts of
Occidental and Vintage senior notes and unsecured subsidiary notes.  

  In
2005, Occidental recorded $42 million of pre-tax interest charges to redeem all of its outstanding 5.875-percent senior notes,
4.101-percent medium-term senior notes and 7.65-percent senior notes and to purchase in the open market and retire various amounts
of Occidental senior notes and unsecured subsidiary notes.  

  At
December 31, 2007, minimum principal payments on long-term debt subsequent to December 31, 2007, aggregated $1,777 million, of which
$35 million is due in 2008, $684 million in 2009, $239 million in 2010, $68 million in 2011, $368 million in 2012, zero in 2013 and
$383 million thereafter.  

  At
December 31, 2007, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidental's capacity for additional
unsecured borrowing was approximately $54.8 billion and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on,
and for acquisitions of, Occidental s capital stock was approximately $20.8 billion, assuming that such dividends,
distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowings.  

  49  

Occidental
estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the yields
offered to Occidental for debt of similar rating and similar remaining maturities. The estimated fair values of Occidental s
debt, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were approximately $1.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, compared with carrying values
of approximately $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.  

   NOTE
6    LEASE COMMITMENTS   

  The
present value of minimum capital lease payments, net of the current portion, totaled $25 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.
These amounts are included in other liabilities.  

  Operating
and capital lease agreements, which include leases for manufacturing facilities, office space, railcars and tanks, frequently
include renewal and/or purchase options and require Occidental to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance
expense.  

  At
December 31, 2007, future net minimum lease payments for capital and noncancelable operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other
mineral leases, utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense) were the following:  

Rental
expense for operating leases, net of sublease rental income, was $196 million in 2007, $199 million in 2006 and $141 million in
2005. Rental expense was net of sublease income of $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

   NOTE
7    DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES   

  Occidental's
market risk exposures relate mainly to commodity prices. Occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce
these price fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another
instrument or variable.  

  In
general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or
similar valuation models.  

   COMMODITY
PRICE RISK   

   General   

  Occidental s
results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices.  

   Marketing
and Trading Operations   

  Occidental
periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives have been used
by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity-related cash flows. Occidental
enters into low-risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established
policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a
combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidental's use of derivatives in
marketing and trading activities primarily relates to managing cash flows from third-party purchases, which includes
Occidental s periodic gas storage activities.  

  50  

Production
Hedges   

  In
2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and collar agreements that qualify as cash-flow hedges for the sale of a
portion of its crude oil production. Additionally, Occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the Vintage
acquisition. The fixed price swaps and the basis swaps expired in 2007. The collar agreements continue to the end of 2011. The 2007
volume that was hedged was less than 3 percent of Occidental s 2007 crude oil and natural gas production.

  The
following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of Occidental s marketing and trading contracts, a portion of
which are hedges, during 2007 and 2006, and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2007 by maturity periods.

      into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value.     

   INTEREST
RATE RISK   

   General   

  Occidental s
exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its
interest-rate swaps that were accounted for as fair-value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion
of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20
million, which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006. The amount of interest expense recorded in the
income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain, by approximately $13 million and $21 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

   CREDIT
RISK   

  Occidental s
energy contracts are spread among several counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty
and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits. Credit exposure for each
customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark-to-market exposure. Losses associated with
credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented.  

   FOREIGN
CURRENCY RISK   

  A
few of Occidental s foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary
assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most
international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental s consolidated foreign oil and
gas subsidiaries have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental had not entered into any
foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic
income and is immaterial.

DERIVATIVE
AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES   

  The
following table shows derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets:  

The
following table summarizes net after-tax derivative activity recorded in AOCI:  

During
the next twelve months, Occidental expects that approximately $114 million of net derivative after-tax losses included in AOCI,
based on their valuation at December 31, 2007, will be reclassified into earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a material
impact on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  

   NOTE
8    ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES   

  Occidental s
operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining
environmental quality. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the
future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are
considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand.  

   ENVIRONMENTAL
REMEDIATION   

  The
laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of
substances to the environment. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current
ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in environmental assessments and cleanups under these
laws at currently-owned facilities, previously-owned sites and third-party sites. Also, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been
involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including,
in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive
damages and civil penalties.  

  At
December 31, 2007, Occidental, through a wholly owned subsidiary, participated in or monitored ongoing or recent assessments,
remediation, proceedings or information requests at 163 sites. Thirty-nine of these sites are currently listed or proposed for
listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the National Priorities List. The following table presents Occidental's
environmental remediation reserves, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($69 million in 2007, $79
million in 2006 and $83 million in 2005) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities   other ($388 million in
2007, $333 million in 2006 and $335 million in 2005). The reserves are grouped by three categories of environmental remediation
sites:  

52  

The
following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:  

Occidental
expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next four years and the balance over
the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities
beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental
remediation matters could be up to $400 million beyond the amount accrued. For management s opinion with respect to
environmental matters, refer to Note 9.  

   CERCLA
and Equivalent Sites   

  As
of December 31, 2007, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 CERCLA or equivalent proceedings, as shown
below.  

(a)   
     
        Includes 30 sites for
      which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 6 sites where Occidental has denied
      liability without challenge, 31 sites where Occidental s reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 18 sites where reserves
      are between $50,000 and $1 million each.     

  The
six sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2007 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two
closed landfills in western New York and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan,
western New York and Tacoma, Washington).  

   Active
Facilities   

  Certain
subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 17 active facilities. Four assets  
a chemical plant in Louisiana, a chemical plant in Kansas and certain oil and gas properties and pipeline systems in the
southwestern United States   account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities.  

   Closed
or Sold Facilities   

  There
are 41 other sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation
requirements in which OPC or its subsidiaries are involved. Four sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this
group. The four sites are:  an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain
remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a
former phosphorous processing and recovery facility in Tennessee.  

   ENVIRONMENTAL
COSTS   

  Occidental s
costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each
segment:  

53  

Operating
expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating
facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future
revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures
for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase.  

   NOTE
9    LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS   

  OPC
or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other
things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under CERCLA and
similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of
remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental
is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other
financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings,
Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated.  

  Since
2004, Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) has been served with ten lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,600 individual
plaintiffs. These individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of
their alleged exposure to a pesticide. OCC is aware of, but has not been served in, 23 additional cases in Nicaragua, which
Occidental understands make similar allegations. In the opinion of management, the claims against OCC are without merit because,
among other things, OCC believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the applicable
Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre-trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from
participating fully in their defense. OCC filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre-trial
deposit. In 2004, the judge in one of the cases (Osorio case) ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OCC,
and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre-trial deposit. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OCC
elected not to make a substantive appearance in the Osorio case. In 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against
several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In December 2006, the court in a second case in
Nicaragua (Rios case) entered a judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $800 million.
While preserving its jurisdictional defenses, OCC has appealed the judgments in the Osorio and Rios cases. In September 2007, the
plaintiffs in the Osorio case filed an action in state court in Florida seeking to enforce the Nicaraguan judgment. That action was
removed to and is presently pending in federal court. OCC has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, any judgment
rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio and Rios cases, would be unenforceable in the United States.  

  During
the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes.
Corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through the current year are in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law.  

  At
December 31, 2007, commitments for major capital expenditures during 2008 and thereafter were approximately $330 million.  

  Occidental
has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical
power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2007, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion
of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $52
million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2008   $12, 2009   $10, 2010   $10, 2011   $9, 2012  
$8 and thereafter   $3. Fixed payments under these agreements were $18 million in 2007, $18 million in 2006 and $17 million in
2005.  

  Occidental
has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services
at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable,
involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.8 to $3.9 billion in capital expenditures estimated for 2008.  

  Occidental
has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of
guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and other affiliates
will meet their various obligations (guarantees).  

  At
December 31, 2007, the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of FIN 45 was approximately
$250 million, which consists of Occidental s guarantee of equity investees  debt, primarily from the Dolphin Project
equity investment, and other commitments.  

  54  

Occidental
has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with
purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the
other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2007, Occidental is not aware of circumstances
it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that
would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.  

  It
is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any
lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities. If
these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidental s reserves, an outcome
not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidental s consolidated
financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidental s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.  

   NOTE
10    DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAXES   

  The
domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income and other taxes were as
follows:  

The
provisions(credits) for domestic and foreign income and other taxes from continuing operations consisted of the
following:  

As
a result of changes in compensation programs in 2006, Occidental wrote off approximately $40 million of the related deferred tax
asset that had been recognized in the financial statements prior to the changes. The 2005 federal income tax provision includes a
$619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax credit issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a $335
million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required. The 2005 income tax provision also includes a net $10
million charge related to a state tax issue.  

  The
following is a reconciliation, stated as a percentage of pre-tax income, of the United States statutory federal income tax rate to
Occidental s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations:  

55  

The
tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:  

Included
in total deferred tax assets was a current portion aggregating $230 million and $190 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, that was reported in prepaid expenses and other.  

  Occidental
has, as of December 31, 2007, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $242 million which expire in varying amounts through 2017 and
various state net operating loss carryforwards which have varying carryforward periods through 2025. Occidental established a
valuation allowance against these foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating losses as the Company believes these
assets will not be utilized in the statutory carryforward periods. In addition, Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against
deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences when it believes future benefit is unlikely to be
realized.  

  A
deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to Occidental s investment in certain foreign
subsidiaries primarily as a result of unremitted earnings of consolidated subsidiaries aggregating approximately $4.8 billion at
December 31, 2007, as it is Occidental s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently. If the earnings of these
foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $60 million would be
required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.  

  The
discontinued operations include an income tax charge of $141 million in 2007, a benefit of $92 million in 2006, and a charge of $188
million in 2005.  

  The
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was reduced by an income tax charge of $2 million in 2005.  

  Additional
paid-in capital was credited $43 million in 2007, $140 million in 2006 and $74 million in 2005 for a tax benefit from the exercise
of certain stock-based compensation awards.  

  As
discussed in Note 3, Occidental adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. The following table shows the effect of adopting FIN No. 48
on the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2007 (in millions):

  As
of the January 1, 2007 adoption, Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $77 million included in
deferred credits and other liabilities   other, which included approximately $61 million that, if subsequently recognized,
would have affected Occidental s effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2007, Occidental had liabilities for unrecognized tax
benefits of approximately $83 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities   other, which included approximately
$66 million that, if subsequently recognized, would have affected Occidental s effective tax rate.  

  56  

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  

Occidental
continues to recognize an estimate of potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the
provisions for domestic and foreign income and other taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Occidental
recognized approximately $2 million, $5 million and $2 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. Occidental s accrued
interest and penalties were $11 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

  During
the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for U.S. federal and state corporate income tax
purposes. Taxable years 2001 through the current year are in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Foreign
government tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental, and income taxes for taxable years from 2002 through 2007
remain subject to examination. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law.  

  It
is reasonably possible that Occidental s existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the
next twelve months primarily due to the progression of audits in process or the expiration of statutes of limitation. Occidental
cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential changes in such benefits due to the unresolved nature of the various
audits.  

   NOTE
11    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY   

  The
following is an analysis of common stock:  

In
May 2006, Occidental amended its Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
to 1.1 billion. The par value per share remained unchanged.  

   TREASURY
STOCK   

  In
2007, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to Occidental's treasury stock purchase program under which Occidental is
authorized to purchase up to 55 million shares of its common stock. Additionally, Occidental purchased shares from the trustee of
its defined contribution savings plan. In 2007, Occidental purchased 20.6 million shares under the programs at an average cost of
$54.75 per share. In 2006, Occidental purchased 30.6 million shares under the programs at an average cost of $48.20 per
share.  

  In
February 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to Occidental's treasury stock purchase program, which increased the
number of shares that Occidental is authorized to purchase from 55 to 75 million shares.  

   NONREDEEMABLE
PREFERRED STOCK   

  Occidental
has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
Occidental had no outstanding shares of preferred stock.  

   EARNINGS
PER SHARE   

  Basic
earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year,
including vested but unissued share and share units. The computation of diluted earnings per share further reflects the dilutive
effect of stock options and stock-settled SARs.  

  57  

The
following are the share amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:  

ACCUMULATED
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS   

  Accumulated
other comprehensive loss consisted of the following after-tax (losses) gains:

        See Note 13 for further
      information.     

   NOTE
12    STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS   

  Occidental
has established several Plans that provide for stock-based awards in the form of Options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock bonuses,
SARs, PSAs, PRSUs, TSRIs, CSSUs and dividend equivalents. These awards were granted under the 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (1995 ISP),
2001 Incentive Compensation Plan (2001 ICP), Phantom Share Unit Awards Plan and the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2005 LTIP). No
further awards will be granted under the 1995 ISP and 2001 ICP; however, certain 1995 ISP and 2001 ICP award grants were outstanding
at December 31, 2007. An aggregate of 66 million shares of Occidental common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2005 LTIP and
at December 31, 2007, approximately 43.3 million shares of Occidental common stock were available for future awards. All
non-employee director awards are now granted under the 2005 LTIP. During 2007, non-employee directors were granted awards for 59,800
shares of restricted stock that fully vested on the grant date. Awards that have been granted to directors under the 2005 LTIP are
restricted and may not be sold or transferred for three years, except in the case of death or disability, during the director s
period of service as a member of the Board. Compensation expense for these awards was measured using the quoted market price of
Occidental's common stock on the grant date and was recognized at grant date.  

   ADOPTION
OF SFAS NO. 123(R)   

  On
July 1, 2005, Occidental changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation from the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value
accounting method to the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental had already been
expensing its SARs, RSUs and PSAs. On July 1, 2005, Occidental began expensing its Options and recording compensation expense for
all its other stock-based incentive awards using fair value amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).  

  The
table below summarizes certain stock-based incentive amounts for the past three years (all amounts in millions):  

(a)   
     
        Includes liabilities
      paid under the cash-settled SARs.    

(b)   
     
        As measured on the
      vesting date for RSUs and the stock-settled portion of the PSAs.     

  58  

As
of December 31, 2007, there was $209 million of pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense related to all unvested stock-based
incentive award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.  

   STOCK
OPTIONS AND SARs   

  Certain
employees are granted Options that are settled in physical stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
Exercise prices of the Options and SARs are equal to the quoted market value of Occidental s stock on the grant date.
Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years with a maximum term of ten years. These Options and SARs may be
forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.  

  The
fair value of each Option or stock-settled SAR is measured on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model and
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted average life
of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at the grant date. The volatility factors are based on the historical
volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives as estimated on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is the
implied yield available on zero coupon (US Treasury Strip) T-notes at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected
life. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price
on the grant date. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by
employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the
original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.  

  The
grant date assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation for Options and stock-settled SARs were as follows:  

The
grant date fair values of each stock-settled SAR granted in 2006 and 2005 were $14.77 and $10.76, respectively. The grant date fair
value of each Option granted in 2004 was $4.02. The fair value of the cash-settled SARs is also estimated using the Black Scholes
model and is recalculated using updated assumptions each quarter until they are exercised. Changes in the fair value between the
date of grant and the date when the cash-settled SARs are exercised are recognized as compensation expense.  

  The
following is a summary of Option and SAR transactions during 2007:  

RSUs   

  Certain
employees are awarded the right to receive RSUs that vest ratably three and five years after the grant date and can be forfeited or
accelerated under certain conditions. Dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense for RSUs is
measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental's common stock on the grant date. The weighted average grant
date fair values of the RSUs granted in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $52.68, $50.45, $40.91, $25.35 and $16.55,
respectively.  

  59  

A
summary of changes in Occidental s unvested RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2007 is presented below:  

PERFORMANCE-BASED
AWARDS   

   PRSUs   

  Certain
executives are awarded PRSUs with a performance measure based on Occidental s three-year cumulative return on equity with
payout amounts varying from 0 to 200 percent of the target award. The PRSUs vest at the end of the three-year period following the
grant date if performance targets are certified as being met. Compensation expense is measured on the grant date using the quoted
market price of Occidental s common stock and the number of shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria.
Compensation expense is adjusted during the vesting period only for changes in expected share payout. Cumulative dividend
equivalents are paid in cash at the end of the performance period for the number of shares certified for payout.  

  A
summary of Occidental s PRSUs issued during the year ended December 31, 2007, is presented below:  

PSAs
and TSRIs   

  Certain
executives are awarded PSAs and TSRIs that vest at the end of the four-year period following the grant date if performance targets
are certified as being met. For PSAs granted prior to July 2007 payouts range from 0 to 200 percent of the target award and include
provisions to provide that the first 100 percent payout will be settled only in stock and any payout in excess of 100 percent will
be settled substantially in cash. For TSRIs granted in July 2007, payouts range from 0 to 150 percent of the target award and
include provisions to provide for settlement, once certified, to occur equally in stock and cash. Dividend equivalents for PSA and
TSRI target shares are paid during the performance period regardless of the payout range or settlement provision.  

  The
fair values of the stock-settled portion of PSAs and TSRIs are measured on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model using
Occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer companies. The expected life is
based on the vesting period (Term). The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental stock over the
Term. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon (US Treasury Strip) T-notes at the time of grant
with a remaining term equal to the Term. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a
percentage of the stock price on the grant date. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the
value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness
of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.  

  The
grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-settled PSAs and TSRIs were as follows:  

60  

The
fair value of the cash-settled portion of PSAs and TSRIs is also estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model each quarter,
through vesting, using updated assumptions. Changes in fair value of the cash-settled portion of the PSAs and TSRIs are recorded as
compensation expense.  

  A
summary of Occidental s unvested PSAs and TSRIs as of December 31, 2007 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2007, is
presented below:  

(a)   
     
        Unvested awards and
      award grants are presented at the target payouts.    

(b)   
     
        Actual payout may be up
      to 200 percent of this amount for PSAs granted prior to July 2007. The TSRIs granted in July 2007 have a maximum payout of 150
      percent.    

(c)   
     
        The weighted-average
      payout at vesting was 198 percent of the target.     

   CSSUs   

  Certain
employees are awarded the right to receive CSSUs (which include and have been issued as Long-Term Incentive awards). CSSUs are
equivalent in value to actual shares of Occidental common stock but are paid in cash at the time of vesting. The fair value of the
CSSUs is measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental common stock and expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period. CSSUs vest either in total over two years or ratably over three years after the grant date and can be
forfeited or accelerated under certain conditions. For CSSUs which vest in total over two years, dividend equivalents are
accumulated during the vesting period and are paid when they vest. For CSSUs which vest ratably, dividend equivalents are paid
during the vesting period. Changes in the fair value between the grant date and the date when the CSSUs vest are recognized as
compensation expense. The weighted average grant date fair values of the CSSUs granted in 2007 and 2006 were $61.90 and $48.59,
respectively.  

  A
summary of changes in Occidental s unvested CSSUs during the year ended December 31, 2007 is presented below:  

PRO-FORMA
INFORMATION   

  Occidental
adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005. The following table shows the pro forma net income and earnings per share that Occidental
would have recorded if compensation expense were determined using SFAS No. 123(R) for these periods (amounts in millions, except per
share amounts).

NOTE
13    RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS   

  Occidental
has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees. As discussed
in Note 3, on December 31, 2006, Occidental adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158.  

   DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLANS   

  All
domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution
retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay,
age level and employee contributions. Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that provides
restoration of benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits. The accrued liabilities for the
supplemental retirement plan were $84 million, $70 million and $61 million as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
Occidental expensed $86 million in 2007, $74 million in 2006 and $66 million in 2005 under the provisions of these defined
contribution and supplemental retirement plans.  

   DEFINED
BENEFIT PLANS   

  Participation
in the defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 1,000 domestic and 1,100 foreign national employees, mainly union,
nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently
accruing benefits under these plans.  

  Pension
costs for Occidental s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by
payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.  

   OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS   

  Occidental
provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their
eligible dependents. The benefits generally are funded by Occidental as the benefits are paid during the year. The total benefit
costs, including the postretirement costs, were approximately $131 million in 2007, $120 million in 2006 and $104 million in
2005.  

   OBLIGATIONS
AND FUNDED STATUS   

  Occidental
uses a measurement date of December 31 for all defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans.  

(a)   
     
        Relates to the
      acquisition of Tidelands in 2006.     

  62  

The
projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with an
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were $111 million, $104 million and zero, respectively, as of December 31,
2007, and $96 million, $90 million and zero, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with plan assets in excess of the accumulated
benefit obligation were $415 million, $396 million and $566 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007, and $427 million, $404
million, and $556 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006.  

  Occidental
has 401(h) accounts established within certain defined benefit pension plans. These plans allow Occidental to fund postretirement
medical benefits for employees at two of its operations. Contributions to these 401(h) accounts are made at Occidental's discretion.
All of Occidental's other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded.  

  Amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:  

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, AOCI included the following after-tax balances:  

Occidental
does not expect any plan assets to be returned during 2008.  

   COMPONENTS
OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AND OTHER AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OCI   

(a)   
     
        Settlement cost relates
      to benefit distributions made in 2007 and special termination benefits cost relates to the Pottstown plant closure in
      2005.     

  The
estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic
benefit cost over the next fiscal year are zero and $1 million, respectively. The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the
other defined benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year
are $16 million and $1 million, respectively.  

   ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION   

  Occidental s
defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are determined based on various assumptions and discount rates.
Occidental uses the fair value of assets to determine expected return on plan assets in calculating pension expense. Occidental
funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the terms of the applicable collective bargaining
agreements.  

  63  

The
following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic
benefit cost for domestic plans:  

For
domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, Occidental bases the discount rate on the Hewitt Bond Universe yield curve
in 2007 and the average yield provided by the Moody s Aaa Corporate Bond Index in 2006. The weighted average rate of increase
in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental s past and anticipated future compensation increases for employees
participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation. The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is
estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns. Historical returns and correlation of
equities and fixed income securities are studied. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also
evaluated.  

  For
pension plans outside of the United States, Occidental bases its discount rate on rates indicative of government and/or investment
grade corporate debt in the applicable country, taking into account hyperinflationary environments where necessary. The discount
rates used for the foreign pension plans ranged from 3 to 11 percent at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. The average rate of
increase in future compensation levels ranged from a low of 2 percent to a high of 10 percent in 2007, dependent on local economic
conditions and salary budgets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 5.5 percent in excess of local inflation in
both 2007 and 2006.  

  The
postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance
coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health
care cost trend rates projected at an assumed Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 2.5 percent as of December 31, 2007 and 2006
(beginning in 1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases
in the CPI). For certain union employees, the health care cost trend rates were projected at annual rates ranging ratably from 10
percent in 2007 to 6 percent through the year 2011 and level thereafter. A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these
assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of $21 million or a reduction of $20 million, respectively, in the
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007, and a corresponding increase or reduction of $1 million in interest cost
in 2007. The annual service costs would not be materially affected by these changes.  

  The
actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that,
depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan liabilities accrued.  

  Asset
allocations of Occidental s defined benefit pension and funded postretirement benefit plans are as follows:  

Occidental
employs a total return investment approach that uses a mix of equity and fixed income investments to maximize the long-term return
of plan assets at a prudent level of risk. The investments are monitored by Occidental s Investment Committee in its role as
fiduciary. The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional
investment management firms to manage specific assignments across the spectrum of asset classes. The resulting aggregate investment
portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified
across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations. Other asset classes such
as private equity and real estate may be used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Investment
performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment and manager guideline compliance reviews,
annual liability measurements, and periodic studies.  

  64  

Occidental
expects to contribute $3 million to its defined benefit pension plans during 2008. All of the contributions are expected to be in
the form of cash.  

  Estimated
future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:  

NOTE
14    INVESTMENTS AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

  At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, investments in unconsolidated entities comprised $521 million and $498 million of equity method
investments and $234 million and $294 million of advances to equity method investees, respectively. The remainder of the 2007
investments in unconsolidated entities reflects available-for-sale securities.  

   EQUITY
INVESTMENTS   

  At
December 31, 2007, Occidental s equity investments consist mainly of a 24.5-percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy
Limited (Dolphin Energy), and various other partnerships and joint ventures, discussed below. Equity investments paid dividends of
$33 million, $113 million and $161 million to Occidental in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, cumulative
undistributed earnings of equity-method investees since acquisition were $120 million. At December 31, 2007, Occidental s
investments in equity investees exceeded the underlying equity in net assets by $252 million, of which $140 million represents
goodwill that will not be amortized and $112 million represents intangible assets, which is being amortized over the life of the
underlying assets.  

  The
following table presents Occidental s ownership interest in the summarized financial information of its equity method
investments:  

Occidental s
investment in the Dolphin Project consists of two separate economic interests: a 24.5-percent undivided interest in a Development
and Production Sharing Agreement, which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements, and a 24.5-percent ownership
interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which is accounted for as an equity investment. In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into a
bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a
previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. The new bridge loan has a term of four
years, is a revolving credit facility through April 2008 and may be converted to a term loan thereafter. In September 2005, Dolphin
Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the
Dolphin Project. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2007,
Occidental s portion of the bridge loan and financing facility was $816 million. Occidental had recorded $588 million on the
balance sheet at December 31, 2007, for the combined bridge loan and financing facility. The remaining amounts of the bridge loan
and financing facility drawdowns are included in the guarantee amounts discussed in Note 9.  

  In
Ecuador, Occidental has a 14-percent interest in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline. As of December 31,
2007, Occidental s net investment in and advances to the project totaled $69 million. Occidental reports this investment in its
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt,
which is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship-or-pay tariffs of certain upstream  

  65  

producers
in Ecuador. In May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidental s contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its
oil-producing operations in the country, and seized Occidental s Block 15 assets. Occidental s guarantee of its share of
the ship-or-pay obligations provides the lenders the right to require Occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of
the expropriation, which has not been exercised to date. At December 31, 2007, the total pre-tax advance tariff payment of
approximately $89 million was accrued in Occidental s consolidated financial statements. This advance tariff would be used by
the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2007, Occidental also had obligations relating to
performance bonds totaling $14 million.  

  Occidental
has a 50-percent interest in Elk Hills Power, LLC (EHP), a limited liability company that operates a gas-fired, power-generation
plant in California. OCP and EHP are VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46. Occidental has concluded it is not the primary
beneficiary of OCP or EHP and, therefore, accounts for these investments using the equity method.  

   ADVANCES
TO EQUITY INVESTEES   

  In
2004, Occidental entered into a note receivable (Note) with an equity method investee. The Note bears interest at 2.5 percent and is
due December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding balance on the Note was $182 million and $196 million,
respectively. In 2004, Occidental converted a contribution to an equity method investee into a subordinated revolving credit
agreement (Revolver). The Revolver bears interest at 18 percent and expires on December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
outstanding balance on the Revolver and related accrued interest were $51 million and $1 million and $55 million and $1 million,
respectively.  

   AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE
SECURITIES   

   Lyondell   

  Starting
in 2002, when Occidental acquired an equity investment in Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell), two senior executives of Occidental
held seats on Lyondell s board of directors. One of Occidental s senior executives did not stand for re-election to
Lyondell s board of directors at its annual meeting on May 4, 2006. As a result, Occidental management believed that it no
longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over Lyondell s financial and operating policies and discontinued
accruing its share of Lyondell earnings or losses under equity-method accounting. Subsequent to May 4, 2006, Occidental classified
its Lyondell shares as an available-for-sale investment.  

  In
2005, Occidental sold 11 million shares of Lyondell stock for gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. This sale resulted in a
2005 pre-tax gain of $140 million.  

  In
October 2006, Occidental sold 10 million shares of Lyondell's common stock in a registered public offering for a pre-tax gain of $90
million and gross proceeds of $250 million.  

  In
2007, Occidental sold all of its remaining shares of Lyondell common stock (approximately 21 million shares) for a pre-tax gain of
$326 million and gross proceeds of $672 million.  

   Premcor   

  Valero's
acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale by Occidental of all of the Valero shares received resulted in a pre-tax gain of $726
million in 2005.  

   RELATED-PARTY
TRANSACTIONS   

  Occidental
purchases power, steam and chemicals from its equity investees and sells chemicals and power to its equity investees at
market-related prices. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Occidental entered into the following related-party transactions and had the
following amounts due from or to its related parties:  

66  

NOTE
15    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS   

  Occidental
conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments: oil and gas and chemical. The factors for determining the
reportable segments were based on the distinct nature of their operations. They are managed as separate business units because each
requires and is responsible for executing a unique business strategy.  

  Earnings
of industry segments and geographic areas generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental
remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area assets and results and other earnings from
the segments  equity investments (except as noted below).  

  Identifiable
assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments. Corporate and other assets consist of cash, short-term investments,
certain corporate receivables, an available-for-sale investment in Lyondell (sold in 2007), 12-percent ownership interest in Premcor
(sold in 2005), a leased cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana, a cogeneration facility at Ingleside, Texas (consolidated in
October 2006) and two common carrier oil pipeline systems in the Permian Basin.

NOTE
16    COSTS AND RESULTS OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES   

  In
2007, Occidental completed an exchange of oil and gas interests in Horn Mountain with BP for oil and gas interests in the Permian
Basin and a gas processing plant in Texas. Occidental also sold its oil and gas interests in Pakistan to BP in 2007. In 2006,
Ecuador terminated Occidental s contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil-producing operations in
the country, and seized Occidental s Block 15 assets. Occidental has classified its Horn Mountain, Pakistan and Ecuador
operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis and excluded them from all tables in Note 16.  

  Capitalized

following tables set forth Occidental s net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil,
NGLs, condensate and natural gas and changes in such quantities. Crude oil reserves include condensate. The reserves are stated
after applicable royalties. These estimates include reserves in which Occidental holds an economic interest under PSCs and other
economic arrangements.  

  The
reserve estimation process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of this
process, all reserves volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price
differentials between benchmark prices and prices realized and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the
net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analyses,
material balance calculations that take into account the volume of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated
reservoir pressure changes, or computer simulation of the reservoir performance. Operating costs and capital costs are forecast
based on past experience combined with expectations of future cost for the specific reservoirs. In many cases, activity-based cost
models for a reservoir are utilized to project operating costs as production rates and the number of wells for production and
injection vary.  

  A
senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In
addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (the Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate
officers, to monitor and review Occidental's oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of
Occidental's Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott),
independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2003.  

  Again
in 2007, Ryder Scott has compared Occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted
industry standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes, the economic
evaluations and reserves classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a
selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidental s total reserves portfolio. In 2007,
Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 10 percent of Occidental s oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott
has reviewed Occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 57 percent of Occidental s reported
oil and gas reserves.  

  Based
on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that
the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by
Occidental.  

  Estimates
of proven reserves are collected in a database and changes in this database are reviewed by engineering personnel to ensure
accuracy. Finally, reserves volumes and changes are reviewed and approved by Occidental's senior management.  

  In
2007, Occidental completed an exchange of oil and gas interests in Horn Mountain with BP for oil and gas interests in the Permian
Basin and a gas processing plant in Texas. Occidental also sold its oil and gas interests in Pakistan to BP in 2007. In 2006,
Ecuador terminated Occidental s contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil-producing operations in
the country, and seized Occidental s Block 15 assets. Occidental has classified its Horn Mountain, Pakistan and Ecuador
operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis and excluded them from all tables in the Supplemental Oil and Gas
Information section.

(a)   
     
        All Middle East/North
      Africa amounts, except Libya, are related to PSCs, and do not include amounts related to taxes owed by Occidental but paid by
      governmental entities on its behalf.    

(b)   
     
        The 2007 amounts reflect
      the minority interest in a Colombian subsidiary, partially offset by Occidental's share of reserves from an equity investee in
      Yemen. The 2006 and 2005 amounts include Occidental s share of reserves from an equity investee in Yemen and a Russian
      joint venture, partially offset by the minority interest in a Colombian subsidiary. Occidental's joint venture interest in
      Russia was sold in 2007.    

(c)   
     
        Approximately three
      percent of the proved developed reserves at December 31, 2007 are nonproducing. Over half of these reserves are located in
      Latin America and the remainder is in the United States and Middle East/North Africa. Plans are to begin producing these
      reserves in 2008.

STANDARDIZED
MEASURE, INCLUDING YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES THEREIN, OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS   

  For
purposes of the following disclosures, estimates were made of quantities of proved reserves and the periods during which they are
expected to be produced. Future cash flows were computed by applying year-end prices, except in those instances where future oil or
natural gas sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower prices, to Occidental s share of
estimated annual future production from proved oil and gas reserves, net of royalties. Derivative instruments that qualify as cash
flow hedges have not been included in the estimates of future net cash flows. Future development and production costs were computed
by applying year-end costs to be incurred in producing and further developing the proved reserves. Future income tax expenses were
computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and
foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows. The discount was computed by application
of a 10-percent discount factor. The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual
conditions at each of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. However, such arbitrary assumptions have not necessarily proven to be the
case in the past. Other assumptions of equal validity would give rise to substantially different results.  

  The
year-end prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions. For the 2007, 2006 and 2005
disclosures, the West Texas Intermediate oil prices used were $95.98 per barrel, $61.05 per barrel and $61.04 per barrel,
respectively. The Henry Hub gas prices used for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 disclosures were $6.795/MMBtu, $5.64/MMBtu and $10.08/MMBtu,
respectively.

   AMENDMENT
NUMBER 2   

   OCCIDENTAL
PETROLEUM CORPORATION   

   MODIFIED
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN   

   WHEREAS ,
Occidental Petroleum Corporation (the  Corporation ) maintains the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Modified Deferred
Compensation Plan (the  MDCP ) for the purpose of providing a tax-deferred opportunity for key management and highly
compensated employees of the Corporation and its affiliates to accumulate additional retirement income through deferrals of cash
compensation;  

   WHEREAS ,
it is desirable to amend the MDCP to make certain administrative changes.  

   NOW,
THEREFORE , effective January 1, 2008, the MDCP is amended as follows:  

1.   
     
        Sections
      4.1(a) and (b) are amended in their entirety to provide as follows:     

   (a)      Deferral
Elections . An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan and elect to defer annual Base Salary and/or Bonus under
the Plan by filing with the Committee a completed and fully executed Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of the Plan Year
during which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which such Base Salary and Bonus are to be earned, or at such other
time as the Committee may permit in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code. Deferral
Election Forms must be filed in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Forms.  

  An
employee who first becomes an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year may make an initial deferral election under this Plan within
30 days after the date the employee becomes an Eligible Employee provided that such Eligible Employee has not previously become
eligible to participate in any other account balance plan of the Company as described in Proposed Treasury Regulations
Section 1.409A-1(c)(2) or any successor regulation. Any such election shall apply to Base Salary earned for services performed
after the 30-day election window described in the previous sentence and to that portion of the Bonus earned during such Plan Year
equal to the total amount of the Bonus multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the Plan Year after the 30-day
election window described in the previous sentence ends over the total number of days during the Plan Year that such Eligible
Employee is employed by the Company.  

  Various
deferral options will be made available to Eligible Employees under the Plan, subject to such limitations and  

conditions
as the Committee may impose from time to time, in its complete and sole discretion. A Deferral Election Form filed for a Plan Year
shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year only. For each subsequent Plan Year, an Eligible
Employee who wishes to defer Base Salary and/or Bonus must file a new complete and fully executed Deferral Election Form in
accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Form but in any event prior to January 1 of such Plan
Year.  

  Each
Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of
Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a
specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant. Deferrals of Base Salary will normally be deducted ratably during the Plan
Year. In its sole discretion, the Committee may also permit amounts that an Eligible Employee has previously elected to defer under
other plans or agreements with the Company to be transferred to this Plan and credited to his Deferral Accounts that are maintained
hereunder.  

  (A)      Minimum
Deferral . For each Plan Year, the minimum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is $5,000, if expressed as
a dollar amount, or 5% of Base Salary, if expressed as a percentage, and the minimum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to
defer is any of the following: (I) $5,000, (II) 5% of Bonus, or (III) 100% of that portion of any Bonus that exceeds
a dollar amount specified by the Participant on his Deferral Election Form.  

  (B)      Maximum
Deferral . For each Plan Year, the maximum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is 75% of Base Salary, and
the maximum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is 90% of Bonus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective with
respect to amounts earned on or after January 1, 2007, for each Plan Year, the maximum total amount of Compensation that a
Participant may elect to defer is $75,000. For the 2007 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply only to deferrals of Base Salary
that would otherwise have been paid in 2007. For the 2008 Plan Year, the $75,000 limit shall apply to the deferrals of Base Salary
that would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2007, and otherwise paid in 2008. For the 2008 Plan
Year, the $75,000 limit shall also apply to  

  2  

deferrals
of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid in 2008 plus deferrals of Bonus, earned in 2008, and otherwise paid in 2009. For
the 2009 and all future Plan Years, the $75,000 limit shall apply to amounts of Base Salary and Bonus earned in any one Plan Year.
For example, in Plan Year 2009 , the $75,000 limit shall first apply to deferrals of Base Salary that would have otherwise been paid
in 2009 and then to deferrals of Bonus that are earned in 2009 and would otherwise be payable in 2010.  

  (C)      Deferral
Account Balance . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s
total Deferral Account balance is $1,000,000 or more, then the Participant may not defer any compensation earned in the following
Plan Year and any election to do so shall be considered void. If as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant s total
Deferral Account balance is less than $1,000,000, then the Participant may defer compensation earned in the following Plan Year in
accordance with this Article IV.  

  (b)        Early
Payment Benefit Election . With respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus earned after December 31, 2007, on the Deferral Election
Form filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a), an Eligible Employee may irrevocably elect to receive the Base Salary and/or Bonus
deferred pursuant to that election in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over two (2) to five (5) years commencing prior
to termination of employment in an Early Payment Year. If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early
Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum. The Early Payment Year elected must be a year that begins at
least two (2) years after the end of each Plan Year to which the election applies. An Early Payment Benefit election filed for the
Plan Year beginning January 1, 2008, or for any subsequent Plan Year, shall be effective for the deferred Base Salary and/or
Bonus earned during that Plan Year. A Participant may make an election for an Early Payment Benefit with respect to deferred Base
Salary and/or Bonus earned in any future Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1
of such Plan Year. A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of an Early Payment Benefit
with respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed
pursuant to Section 4.1(a).  

  A
Participant may not at any time have Early Payment Benefits scheduled for more than two Early Payment Years.  

  3  

However,
after an Early Payment Year has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Year election have been
completed, a Participant may elect a new Early Payment Year for future deferrals of Base Salary and/or Bonuses.   

2.   
     
        Section 4.4
      is amended in its entirety to provide as follows:     

   4.4      Interest .
Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the
Declared Rate for each Plan Year, compounded monthly. Except as provided in Section 5.2(a), with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts
for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly
basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account. Amounts of deferred
Compensation that are credited to a DCP Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to
a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed
from date of crediting to the end of the month.   

   IN
WITNESS WHEREOF , the Corporation has caused its duly authorized officer to execute this amendment this ______ day of

   Supplemental
Retirement Plan II   

  Effective
as of January 1, 2005  

Contents

Article
1. Introduction   

   1.1
Establishment and Purpose   

  Occidental
Petroleum Corporation (the  Company ) hereby establishes the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan
II (the  Plan ) effective as of January 1, 2005. It is the purpose of this Plan to provide eligible Employees
with benefits that will compensate them for maximums imposed by law upon contributions to qualified plans. The portion of the Plan
reflecting credits to compensate for the maximum limits imposed by Code section 415 is intended to constitute an  excess
plan  as defined in ERISA section 3(36). The remaining portion of the Plan is intended to constitute a plan which is
unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly
compensated employees and is intended to meet the exemptions provided in ERISA sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1), as
well as the requirements of Department of Labor Regulation section 2520.104-23. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted
so as to meet the requirements of these exemptions and the regulation.  

   1.2
Status of the Plan   

(a)   
     
         Nonqualified
      Plan.  The Plan is not qualified within the meaning of Code section 401(a). The Plan is intended to provide an
      unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future and thus not to involve, pursuant to Treasury Regulation section
      1.83-3(e), the transfer of  property  for purposes of Code section 83. Likewise, allocations under this Plan to the
      account maintained for a Participant, and earnings credited thereon, are not intended to confer an economic benefit upon the
      Participant nor is the right to the receipt of future benefits under the Plan intended to result in any Participant,
      Beneficiary or Alternate Payee being in constructive receipt of any amount so as to result in any benefit due under the Plan
      being includible in the gross income of any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee in advance of the date on which
      payment of any benefit due under the Plan is actually made.    

(b)   
     
         Compliance
      with Code Section 409A.  This Plan is intended to comply with Code section 409A and related regulatory guidance.
      Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, for allocations under this Plan and earnings credited on such
      amounts, no Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee shall have a right to receive a payment if that payment would result
      in making any portion of the Plan benefit subject to federal income tax under Code section 409A before payment of that
      benefit has actually been made to the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee. Consistent with the terms of the Plan, the
      Administrative Committee shall establish rules regarding distribution options that are designed to avoid making any portion of
      the Plan benefit subject to federal income tax under Code section 409A before payment of that benefit has actually been
      made.    

(c)   
     
         No
      Guarantees of Intended Tax Treatment.  The Plan shall be administered and interpreted so as to satisfy the requirements for
      the intended tax treatment under the Code described in this section. However, the treatment of benefits earned under
      and     

  1  

benefits
      received from this Plan, for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws (such as state income and employment tax
      laws), shall be determined under the Code and other applicable tax laws and no guarantee or commitment is made to any
      Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee with respect to the treatment of accruals under or benefits payable from the Plan
      for purposes of the Code and other applicable tax laws.     

   1.3
Application of the Plan   

  The terms
of the Plan are applicable to eligible Employees employed by an Employer on or after January 1, 2005. All distributions and
distribution elections made on or after January 1, 2005 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, as amended
from time to time.

      specified by the Board or Administrative Committee.    

By
      accepting such designation or continuing as a party to the Plan, each Employer acknowledges that:     

(A)   
     
        It is bound
      by such terms and conditions relating to the Plan as the Company or the Administrative Committee may reasonably

      the Employee will be eligible for the allocation specified in subsection (b) as of the first payroll period for which the
      Employee s annualized Based Pay of Record exceeds the Threshold Amount. If the Employee s annualized Base Pay of
      Record decreases during the Plan Year such that it no longer exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Employee shall cease to be
      eligible for the allocation specified in subsection (b) as of the first payroll period for which the Employee s
      annualized Based Pay of Record falls below the Threshold Amount.    

(2)   
     
        An individual
      who is an LTD Participant for the Plan Year.

      Amount.      

(1)   
     
         Contingent
      Credit.  A credit shall be made as of the last day of each month to a contingent account maintained for each Participant
      described in subsection (a). The amount of the credit for the month shall be:

(i)   
     
        4 percent
      of Base Pay of Record for the calendar month below the Wage Base; plus    

(ii)   
     
        8 percent
      of Base Pay of Record for the calendar month above the Wage Base.     

(B)   
     
        For a
      Participant who will have attained age 35 as of the last day of the Plan Year, the sum of:

  10  

(ii)   
     
        12 percent
      of Base Pay of Record for the calendar month above the Wage Base.     

For purposes
      of calculating contingent allocations under this section, an Employee will have Base Pay of Record above the Wage Base for a
      calendar month only to the extent that the Employee s Base Pay of Record for the Plan Year, determined as of the last day
      of such pay period, is in excess of the Wage Base.    

(2)

      paragraph (1) shall be reduced as of the last day of the Plan Year, but not below zero, by the amount determined under
      this paragraph. The reduction amount is intended to be equal to the Employee s allocation under the Retirement Plan for
      the Plan Year. After the reduction described in this paragraph, the remaining amount shall be permanently credited to the
      account maintained for the Participant.     

(A)   
     
        No reduction
      shall apply to the account maintained for any Participant, including an LTD Participant, who is not an Employee on the last
      day of the Plan Year.    

(B)   
     
        The reduction
      amount for other Participants shall be equal to the dollar limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 415(c)(1)(A)
      minus sum of the following:     

(i)   
     
        The Plan
      Limit, determined under Appendix II of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision) times the Participant s Base Pay
      Paid for the Plan Year, and    

(ii)   
     
        6 percent
      times the Participant s Base Pay Paid for the Plan Year.     

For purposes
      of determining the reduction under this subparagraph, no portion of the Participant s Base Pay Paid for the Plan Year in
      excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) in effect for the Plan Year shall be taken into account. The
      reduction amount shall not be less than zero.     

(3)   
     
         Earnings
      Allocation.  The Employer shall also permanently credit earnings on the monthly allocations under paragraph (1) for
      the Plan Year as if such allocations shared in earnings at the rate and in the manner described in section 4.4. The
      earning allocation under this paragraph shall not be subject to reduction under
      paragraph (2).

      specified in subsection (b):    

(b)   
     
         Allocation
      Amount.  The amount to be allocated as of the last day of the Plan Year under this Plan with respect to a Participant

        6 percent
      of the Employee s Base Pay Paid in excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) as adjusted and in
      effect for the Plan Year; and    

(2)   
     
        5 percent
      of the amount allocated under paragraph (1) which shall be allocated to the account maintained for the Participant in
      lieu of interest on such amount for the Plan Year.     

   4.3
Allocations Relating to the Deferred Compensation Plan   

(a)   
     
         Eligibility. 
      An Employee who is a participant in the Retirement Plan and eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for the
      Plan Year shall be provided the allocation for the Plan Year specified in subsection (b).

         Allocation
      Amount.  The amount to be allocated in a Plan Year under this Plan with respect to a Participant described in
      subsection (a) above for the Plan Year shall equal that Participant s applicable percentage multiplied by the amount
      of the bonus the Participant is entitled to elect to defer for that plan year of the Deferred Compensation Plan. This
      allocation shall be made irrespective of whether such Participant elects to defer under the Deferred Compensation Plan all or
      any part of any bonus to which he might be entitled. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no allocation shall be made to
      the account of a Participant who is not an Employee on the date that any such bonus is awarded.    

For purposes
      of this subsection, the term  applicable percentage  shall mean 12 percent in the case of a Participant who
      shall have attained age 35 prior to the end of the Plan Year in which the allocation is made and 8 percent in the case of
      a Participant who shall not have attained age 35 prior to the end of the Plan Year in which the allocation is made. The
      allocation described in this section shall be made to the account of each Participant effective as of the date on which the
      Participant is awarded the bonus he is entitled to defer under the Deferred Compensation Plan.     

   4.4
Maintenance of Accounts   

(a)   
     
        Each
      Employer shall establish and maintain, in the name of each Participant employed by that Employer, an individual account which
      shall consist of all amounts credited to the Participant. As of the end of each month, the Administrative Committee shall
      increase the balance, if any, of the Participant s individual account as of the last day of the preceding month, by
      multiplying such amount by a number equal to one plus .167% plus the monthly yield on 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturities for
      the monthly processing period.     

  12  

(b)   
     
        The
      individual account of each Participant shall represent a liability, payable when due under this Plan, out of the general
      assets of the Company, or from the assets of any trust, custodial account or escrow arrangement which the Company may
      establish for the purpose of assuring availability of funds sufficient to pay benefits under this Plan. The money and any
      other assets in any such trust or account shall at all times remain the property of the Company, and neither this Plan nor any
      Participant shall have any beneficial ownership interest in the assets thereof. No property or assets of the Company shall be
      pledged, encumbered, or otherwise subjected to a lien or security interest for payment of benefits hereunder. Accounting for
      this Plan shall be based on generally accepted accounting principles.     

   4.5
Vesting and Forfeiture   

  Notwithstanding
any other Plan provision, all benefits under this Plan shall be contingent and forfeitable and no Participant shall have a vested
interest in any benefit unless, while he is still employed by an Employer, he becomes fully vested in his benefit under the
Retirement Plan (or would have become vested if he were a participant in the Retirement Plan). A person who terminates employment
with an Employer for any reason prior to becoming vested hereunder shall not receive a benefit, provided that, upon rehire by an
Employer, any amounts forfeited by a Participant at the time of his termination of employment shall be restored, without interest,
to his account.

        In the case
      of a Participant who is a Key Employee, a distribution made on account of Separation from Service may not be made before a
      date that is at least six months after the Participant s Separation from Service.

        No LTD
      Participant shall be entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Plan prior to the time long-term disability payments

      provisions of this Plan and the rules and procedures established by the Administrative Committee for the time and manner of
      making elections. If a Participant fails to make a valid and timely election, the vested account, if any, maintained for the
      Participant shall be paid as a single sum as soon as administratively practicable. In addition, notwithstanding any election
      made by the Participant under this section, if the balance of the vested account, if any, maintained for the Participant is
      less than $50,000 when the amount first becomes payable under section 5.1, the balance shall be paid in a single sum as
      soon as administratively practicable.    

(b)   
     
         Available
      Times and Forms of Payment.  Subject to the provisions of this Article, the Participant may elect to have his account paid
      out as follows:     

(1)   
     
        As single sum
      during the first calendar quarter following the calendar year in which occurs the distribution event specified in
      section 5.1, except death, or    

(2)   
     
        Annual
      installment payments over 5, 10, 15, or 20 years, as elected by the Participant, commencing during the first calendar quarter
      following the calendar year in which occurs the distribution event specified in section 5.1, except death, and continuing
      each year thereafter until the final installment is paid or, if earlier, the Participant dies. While benefits are to be paid
      in installments, the Participant s account will continue to be adjusted as provided in section 4.4(a) until the
      series of installments has been completed. The amount of each annual installment while the Participant is alive shall equal

      fraction, the numerator of which is 1,     

  14  

and the
      denominator of which is the number of installments (including the current one) which remain to be paid. Each installment shall
      be paid as soon as administratively possible after January 31 of the calendar year. If the Participant dies while

      event later than December 31, 2005.

      30 th  day after the Employee first becomes a Participant.    

(e)   
     
         Change of
      Elections.  A Participant shall not be permitted to change his election as to the time and form of payment, regardless of
      whether the Participant made an affirmative initial election or the election was defaulted to a single sum because of the
      Participant s failure to make a valid and timely election, except as provided in this
      section.     

(1)   
     
        Except as
      provided in section 5.3, no election shall be permitted which accelerates the time of any payment.    

(2)   
     
        Any change in
      election resulting in a delay or change in the form of payment shall not take effect until the one-year anniversary of the
      date the changed election is properly made.    

(3)   
     
        In the case
      of a payment on account of the Participant s Separation from Service, the first payment under the changed election must
      result in a deferral for a period of at least 5 years from the date the first payment would have been made under the initial
      election.

Administrative Committee shall not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of payments except as provided in this
section.  

  As of
January 1, 2005, acceleration of the time or schedule of payments shall be permitted only in the following

        A payment to
      an Alternate Payee to the extent necessary to fulfill a Qualified Divorce Order;

payment under this Plan, the Company may require such documents from any taxing authority, or may require such indemnities or a
surety bond from any Participant or Beneficiary, as the Company shall reasonably consider necessary for its protection.

      Plan; to decide all questions of eligibility and determine the amount, manner, and time of payment of any benefits

   6.10
Decisions Conclusive   

  The
Administrative Committee shall exercise their powers hereunder in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. Any and all disputes with
respect to the Plan which may arise involving Participants or their Beneficiaries shall be referred to the Administrative

Fiduciaries   

  The
fiduciaries named in this Article shall have only those specific powers, duties, responsibilities, and obligations as are
specifically given them under this Plan. The Company shall have the sole authority to amend or terminate, in whole or in part, this
Plan. The Administrative Committee shall be a fiduciary under the Plan and shall have the sole responsibility for the administration
of this Plan. The officers and Employees of the Company shall have the responsibility of implementing the Plan and carrying out its
provisions as the Administrative Committee shall direct. A fiduciary may rely upon any direction, information, or action of another
fiduciary as being proper under this Plan, and is not required under this Plan to inquire into the propriety of any such direction,
information, or action. It is intended under this Plan that each fiduciary shall be responsible for the proper exercise of his own
powers, duties, responsibilities, and obligations under this Plan and shall not be responsible for any act or failure to act of
another fiduciary. No fiduciary guarantees in any manner the payment of benefits from this Plan. Any party may serve in more than
one fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan.  

   6.12
Notice of Address   

  Each
person entitled to benefits from the Plan must file with the Administrative Committee or its agent, in writing, his mailing address
and each change of his mailing address. Any communication, statement, or notice addressed to such a person at his latest reported
mailing address will be binding upon him for all purposes of the Plan, and neither the Administrative Committee nor the Company
shall be obliged to search for or ascertain his whereabouts.  

   6.13
Data   

  All
persons entitled to benefits from the Plan must furnish to the Administrative Committee such documents, evidence, or information,
including information concerning marital status, as the Administrative Committee considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of
administering the Plan. It shall be an express condition of the Plan that each such person must furnish such information and sign
such documents as the Administrative Committee may require before any benefits become payable from the Plan. The Administrative
Committee shall be entitled to distribute to a non-spouse Beneficiary in reliance upon the signed statement of the Participant that
he is unmarried without any further liability to a spouse if such statement is false.  

   6.14
Adjustments   

  The
Administrative Committee may adjust benefits under the Plan or make such other adjustments with respect to a Participant or
Beneficiary as are required to correct administrative errors or provide uniform treatment in a manner consistent with the intent and
purposes of the Plan.  

  19  

6.15
Member s Own Participation   

  No member
of the Administrative Committee may act, vote or otherwise influence a decision specifically relating to his own participation under
the Plan.  

   6.16
Indemnification   

(a)   
     
        To the extent
      permitted by the Company s bylaws and applicable law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the following
      persons (  Indemnified Persons  ) under the terms and conditions of this section:     

(1)   
     
        The
      Administrative Committee and each of its members which, for purposes of this section, includes any Employee to whom the
      Administrative Committee has delegated fiduciary or other duties.    

(2)   
     
        The Board and
      each member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and any Employer who has responsibility (whether by delegation from
      another person, an allocation of responsibilities under the terms of this Plan document, or otherwise) for a fiduciary duty, a
      nonfiduciary settlor function (such as deciding whether to approve a plan amendment), or a nonfiduciary administrative task
      relating to the Plan.     

(b)   
     
        The Company
      shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including
      reasonable attorney s fees and court costs, incurred by that person on account of his or her good faith actions or
      failures to act with respect to his or her responsibilities relating to the Plan. The Company s indemnification shall
      include payment of any amounts due under a settlement of any lawsuit or investigation, but only if the Company agrees to the
      settlement.     

(1)   
     
        An
      Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section only if he or she notifies an Appropriate Person at the Company of
      any claim asserted against or any investigation of the Indemnified Person that relates to the Indemnified Person s
      responsibilities with respect to the Plan.     

(A)   
     
        A person is
      an   Appropriate Person   to receive notice of the claim or investigation if a reasonable person would believe
      that the person notified would initiate action to protect the interests of the Company in response to the Indemnified
      Person s notice.    

(B)   
     
        The notice
      may be provided orally or in writing. The notice must be provided to the Appropriate Person promptly after the Indemnified
      Person becomes aware of the claim or investigation. No indemnification shall be provided under this section to the extent that
      the Company is materially prejudiced by the unreasonable delay of the Indemnified Person in notifying an Appropriate Person of
      the claim or investigation.     

(2)   
     
        An
      Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to attorney s fees, court costs or other
      litigation expenses or any settlement of     

  20  

such
      litigation only if the Indemnified Person agrees to permit the Company to select counsel and to conduct the defense of the
      lawsuit.    

(3)   
     
        No
      Indemnified Person shall be indemnified under this section with respect to any action or failure to act that is judicially
      determined to constitute or be attributable to the willful misconduct of the Indemnified Person.    

(4)   
     
        Payments of
      any indemnity under this section shall be made only from insurance or other assets of the Company. The provisions of this
      section shall not preclude such further indemnities as may be available under insurance purchased by the Company or as may be
      provided by the Company under any by-law, agreement or otherwise, provided that no expense shall be indemnified under this
      section that is otherwise indemnified by the Company or by an insurance contract purchased by the
      Company.

7. Amendment and Termination   

   7.1
Amendment and Termination   

  The
Company expects the Plan to be permanent, but since future conditions affecting the Company or any Employer cannot be anticipated or
foreseen, the Company must necessarily and does hereby reserve the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time by
action of the Board, except that no amendment shall reduce the dollar amount permanently credited to a Participant s account
and any such termination or amendment shall apply uniformly to all Participants. The Administrative Committee, in its discretion,
may amend the Plan if it finds that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease benefits or costs. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Board or the Administrative Committee may amend the Plan to:  

(a)   
     
        Ensure that
      this Plan complies with the requirements of Code section 409A for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder
      until the time of distribution; and    

(b)   
     
        Add
      provisions for changes to elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements
      of Code section 409A for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of
      distribution.     

   7.2
Reorganization of Employer   

  In the
event of a merger or consolidation of the Employer, or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Employer to another
corporation, such continuing, resulting or transferee corporation shall have the right to continue and carry on the Plan and to
assume all liabilities of the Employer hereunder without obtaining the consent of any Participant or Beneficiary. If such successor
shall assume the liabilities of the Employer hereunder, then the Employer shall be relieved of all such liability, and no
Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to assert any claim against the Employer for benefits under or in connection with
the Plan.  

   7.3
Protected Benefits   

  If the
Plan is terminated or amended so as to prevent further earnings adjustments, or if liabilities accrued hereunder up to the date of
an event specified in section 7.2 are not assumed by the successor to the Employer, then the dollar amount in the account of
each Participant or Beneficiary (whether or not vested) shall be paid in cash to such Participant or Beneficiary in a single sum on
the last day of the second month following the month in which the amendment or termination occurs.  

  22

      of an adverse benefit determination, the Administrative Committee or its delegate shall provide to the Claimant written or

Article
9. General Provisions   

   9.1
Unsecured General Creditor   

  The rights
of a Participant, Beneficiary, Alternate Payee or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company or Employer
promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company or any Employer, nor shall any assets of the Company
or any Employer be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises.  

   9.2
Trust Fund   

  The
Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan. At its discretion, the Company may establish
one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Administrative Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the
payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the
Company s creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company
shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of,
and shall be paid by, the Company.  

   9.3
Nonassignability   

(a)   
     
        Neither a
      Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or
      otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amount, if any, payable hereunder, or any part
      thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and
      non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for
      the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be
      transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or
      insolvency.    

(b)   
     
        Notwithstanding
      subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be
      created, assigned, or recognized. The Administrative Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to
      determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Administrative Committee constitutes a qualified Divorce Order under this
      Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders. In the event that a Qualified Divorce
      Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in
      the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce
      Order.     

   9.4
Release from Liability to Participant   

  A
Participant s right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of account maintained
for the Participant has been paid or set aside for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order or to the
extent that the Company or the Plan is otherwise subject to a binding judgment, decree, or order for the attachment, garnishment or
execution of any portion of the account maintained for the Participant or of  

  26  

any
distributions therefrom. The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to
such amounts in any case in which:  

(a)   
     
        The Company,
      the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such
      amounts; and    

(b)   
     
        The
      Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to
      comply with the judgment, decree or order.     

   9.5
Employment Not Guaranteed   

  Nothing
contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant
any right to be retained in employment with the Company or any Employer. Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment
agreement to the contrary, the Company and Employer shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a
Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.  

   9.6
Gender, Singular   Plural   

  All
pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine or feminine as the identity of the person or persons
may require. As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular.  

   9.7
Captions   

  The
captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning
or construction of any of its provisions.  

   9.8
Validity   

  In the
event any provision of this Plan is held invalid, void, or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect whatsoever, the
validity of any other provision of this Plan.  

   9.9
Notice   

  Any notice
or filing required or permitted to be given to the Administrative Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and
hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company. Such notice shall be deemed given
as to the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or
certification.  

   9.10
Applicable Law   

  The Plan
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Code section 409A (or other applicable section), and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, and the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.

   TO
THE   

   OCCIDENTAL
PETROLEUM CORPORATION   

   SUPPLEMENTAL
RETIREMENT PLAN II   

   Effective
as of January 1, 2005   

  The
Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II (Effective as of January 1, 2005) ( Plan ) is hereby
amended effective as of January 1, 2008 (unless a different effective date is specified) as follows:  

1.   
     
        Section
      2.1(d), relating to the definition of  Base Pay of Record,  is amended in its entirety to read as
      follows:     

(d)   
     
          Base
      Pay of Record   means the base salary and wages earned while a Participant from an Employer for services rendered,
      including pretax deferrals under the Savings Plan, and amounts contributed pursuant to the Occidental Petroleum Flexible
      Spending Accounts Plan, as amended from time to time.     

(1)   
     
        Base Pay of
      Record does not include:     

(A)   
     
        Bonuses,
      incentives, overtime, shift differential, and overseas differentials;    

(B)   
     
        Reimbursement
      for expenses or allowances, including automobile allowances and moving allowances;    

(C)   
     
        Any amount
      contributed by the Employer (other than pretax deferrals under the Savings Plan and any amounts contributed pursuant to the
      Occidental Petroleum Flexible Spending Accounts Plan, as amended from time to time) to any qualified plan or plan of deferred
      compensation; and    

(D)   
     
        Any amount
      paid by an Employer for other fringe benefits, such as health and hospitalization, and group life insurance benefits, or
      perquisites.     

(2)   
     
        Base Pay of
      Record is determined in accordance with the following rules:     

(A)   
     
        For
      Participants compensated by salary, Base Pay of Record means the actual base salary of record for the Participant (subject to
      the exclusions listed above).    

(B)   
     
        For
      Participants compensated based on mileage driven (primarily truck drivers), Base Pay of Record means the number of miles
      driven multiplied by the applicable mileage pay rate (subject to the exclusions listed above), plus the Participant s
      scheduled number of hours worked in the pay period multiplied by the Participant s base hourly rate (subject to the
      exclusions listed above).     

(C)   
     
        For
      Participants compensated at an hourly rate, Base Pay of Record means the base hourly rate (subject to the exclusions listed
      above) multiplied by the number of regularly scheduled hours worked in a pay period. If the Active Participant s
      regularly scheduled work week is more than 40 hours, Base Pay of Record shall include an additional amount equal to the base
      hourly rate (subject to the exclusions listed above) times one half the number of regularly scheduled hours worked in excess
      of 40 in the work week.    

(D)   
     
        For
      Participants compensated on an eight, ten, twelve, or some other assigned hour Shift Basis and whose annual compensation is
      pre-determined under the Company s payroll recordkeeping system, Base Pay of Record for each pay period shall be the
      Participant s pre-determined annual compensation (subject to the exclusions listed above) divided by the number of pay
      periods applicable to the Participant during the Plan Year. For the purpose of this subsection, the term  Shift
      Basis  means any arrangement whereby Participants work the assigned hour daily shifts which may result in alternating
      work weeks of more and less than 40 hours per week.    

(E)   
     
        Base Pay of
      Record includes vacation pay received in periodic payments and annual vacation payments made to Employees paid by commission,
      but does not include single sum vacation payments to active or terminating Employees.    

(F)   
     
        Base Pay of
      Record includes base salary or wages received during paid leaves of absence and periodic notice pay, but, effective
      July 1, 2006, Base Pay of Record does not include single sum notice pay payments or any severance pay
      payments.    

(G)   
     
        Base Pay of
      Record does not include long-term disability payments or payments made to any Participant pursuant to the Occidental Chemical
      Corporation Weekly Sickness and Accident Plan unless:     

(i)   
     
        Such payments
      are made to the Participant through the payroll accounting department of the Company or an Affiliate, and    

(ii)   
     
        The
      Participant is ineligible for participation in the Retirement Plan.

      annualized Base Pay of Record;     

3.   
     
        A new
      sentence is added at the end of section 3.1, relating to Effective Date of Participation, to read as

4.   
     
        Paragraph (2)
      of section 4.1(b), relating to the Reduction Amount in determining Allocations to the Retirement Plan is amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:     

(2)   
     
         Reduction
      Amount.  The amounts contingently credited to the account maintained for the Participant during the Plan Year under
      paragraph (1) shall be reduced as of the last day of the Plan Year, but not below zero, by the amount determined under

      the Plan Year assuming that the Employee maximized deferrals under the Savings Plan. After the reduction described in this
      paragraph, the remaining amount shall be permanently credited to the account maintained for the
      Participant.     

(A)   
     
        No reduction
      shall apply to the account maintained for any Participant, including an LTD Participant, who is not an Employee on the last
      day of the Plan Year.    

(B)   
     
        The reduction
      amount for other Participants shall be equal to the dollar limit in effect for the Plan Year under Code section 415(c)(1)(A)
      minus sum of the following:     

(I)   
     
        the Plan
      Limit for the Plan Year, determined under Appendix II of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision), times the
      Participant s Base Pay Paid, and    

(II)   
     
        6 percent
      times the Participant s Base Pay Paid for the Plan Year;     

(I)   
     
        the
      Contribution Percentage Limit for the Plan Year, determined under Appendix E of the Savings Plan (or any successor provision)
      times the Participant s Base Pay Paid and 6 percent of the Annual Bonus for the Plan Year,
      and     

  3  

(II)   
     
        6 percent

Annual Bonus for the Plan Year in excess of the amount specified in Code section 401(a)(17) in effect for the Plan Year shall
be taken into account. The reduction amount shall not be less than zero.
