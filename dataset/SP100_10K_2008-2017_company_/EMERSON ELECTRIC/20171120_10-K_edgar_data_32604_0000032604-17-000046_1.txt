If the proposed transaction were to proceed, we can make no assurance as to the completion, terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from any such acquisition. The acquisition would involve increases in the Company's debt levels and outstanding shares. Unforeseen developments, including delays in obtaining various tax, regulatory and other approvals, could delay any acquisition, or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable, or at a higher cost, than expected. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulties in integration and may not realize the degree or timing of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.

We Operate in Businesses That Are Subject to Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products 
    
  Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company and we also compete with many smaller companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share.  
    
  Our Operating Results Depend in Part on Continued Successful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Successfully Introduce New Products and Services 
    
  The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. 
    
  If We Are Unable to Defend or Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights the Company's Competitive Position Could Be Adversely Affected 
    
  The Company's intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer competitive harm. 
    
  We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, Which Are Subject to Domestic and Foreign Regulatory Requirements, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating and Separating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits 
    
  We regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In   2017   and in past years, we have made various acquisitions, including the valves   controls business, and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  
    
  We Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products 
    
  Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we  
  
   8 

monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results. 
    
  Our Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue 
    
  We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials internationally. Emerging market sales represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our and our suppliers  international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strife, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences. 
    
  Our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulation in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.  
    
  Our Substantial Sales Both in the U.S. and Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Local Government Regulations and Policies and Foreign Currency Fluctuations 
    
  We sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products globally, with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets. We expect sales in non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. Our U.S. and international operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings, which could adversely affect our results. In addition, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results. 
    
  Recessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in End Markets We Serve May Negatively Affect Our Operations 
    
  In the past, our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs. If our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results. In addition, these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets. 
    
  Access to Funding Through the Capital Markets Is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results 
    
  Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.

Our Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel 
    
  Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
    
  Security Breaches or Disruptions of Our Information Technology Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business 
    
  The Company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses.  Despite the implementation of extensive security measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the Company s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyberattack and other events, ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. Although considered unlikely, it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Should the Company be unable to prevent security breaches, disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose the Company to litigation, increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage. 
    
  We Are Subject to Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results 
    
  We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving intellectual property, product liability and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws. 
    
  ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
    
  None. 
    
  ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES 
    
  At   September 30, 2017  , the Company had approximately 200 manufacturing locations worldwide, of which approximately 130 were located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent in Canada and Latin America. Manufacturing locations by business are: Automation Solutions, 150, and Commercial   Residential Solutions, 50, including 40 in the Climate Technologies segment and 10 in the Tools   Home Products segment. The majority of the locations are owned, with the remainder occupied under lease. The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used. 
    
  ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings, some of which claim substantial amounts of damages. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, but historically the Company has been largely successful in both prosecuting and defending claims and lawsuits. 
    
  The Company believes a material adverse impact of any pending litigation is unlikely. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties of litigation, a remote possibility exists that litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company.   
    
  Information regarding legal proceedings is set forth in Note 13.

  ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Safe Harbor Statement 
    
  This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A -  Risk Factors,  which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.   

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  To supplement the Company s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain  non-GAAP financial measures,  as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions, other acquisitions or divestitures, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. 

13 

Underlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure:   net sales  ). 
    
  Operating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT divided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. All these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures:   pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  ). 
    
  Earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders  equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, costs, impacts of the strategic portfolio repositioning actions, or other items provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders' equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the Company s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures:   earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders  equity, return on total capital  ). 
    
  Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the Company s cash generating capabilities, and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the Company's ability to support its dividend, after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow, free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the Company s ability to generate cash and support its dividend (U.S. GAAP measure:   operating cash flow, operating cash flow as a percent of net sales, dividends as a percent of operating cash flow  ).

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
  Report of Management 
  The Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements. Management believes that the financial statements for the three years ended   September 30, 2017   have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods. 
  In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting control. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur and that estimates and judgments are required to assess the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period. 
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services. 
  The independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective. 
  Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and the criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   September 30, 2017  . 
  The valves   controls business was acquired on April 28, 2017. Management has excluded this business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. Valves   controls' total assets and revenues excluded from the assessment represented approximately 20 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of the Company's related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017.   
  The Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.                     /s/ David N. Farr

Results of Operations 
  Years ended September 30 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

OVERVIEW 
  In 2017, Emerson successfully completed the previously announced strategic actions to streamline its portfolio and drive growth in its core businesses. These actions resulted in the divestiture of the network power systems, and power generation, motors and drives businesses, which are reported in discontinued operations for all years presented. Additionally, on April 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Pentair's valves   controls business. 
    
  Sales from continuing operations for   2017   were   $15.3 billion  , an increase of   $742 million  , or   5 percent  , supported by the acquisition of the valves   controls business, which added   4 percent  . Underlying sales were up   1 percent   compared with the prior year reflecting improving economic conditions and industrial end markets.  
    
  Earnings from continuing operations common stockholders were   $1,643 million   in   2017  , up   3 percent   compared with prior year earnings of   $1,590 million  . Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were   $2.54  , up   4 percent   versus   $2.45   per share in   2016  . Earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.64, up 8 percent, excluding first year acquisition accounting charges of $0.10 per share related to the valves   controls business which deducted 4 percentage points.  
    
  Discontinued operations in   2017   was a net loss of $125 million, $0.19 per share, reflecting the impact of completing the divestitures. Discontinued operations income in 2016 was   $45 million  ,   $0.07   per share. See Note 4 for further information. 
    
  Net earnings common stockholders, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, were   $1,518 million   in   2017  , down   7 percent   compared with prior year earnings of   $1,635 million  . Diluted earnings per share were   $2.35  , down   7 percent   versus   $2.52   per share in   2016  .  
  
   16 

Sales increased in both businesses. Automation Solutions sales increased   5 percent   due to the acquisition of the valves   controls business, while underlying sales decreased slightly, reflecting weakness in energy-related markets which began to improve in the second half of the year. Commercial   Residential Solutions sales increased   5 percent   reflecting favorable conditions in HVAC, refrigeration and construction related markets. 
    
  The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of   $2.7 billion   in 2017, an increase of   $191 million  , or 8 percent. Total operating cash flow of   $1.9 billion   was reduced by cash used for discontinued operations of   $778 million   to execute the repositioning, primarily for income taxes on completion of the divestitures and repatriation of cash.  
    
  NET SALES 
  Net sales for   2017   were   $15.3 billion  , an increase of   $742 million  , or   5 percent   compared with   2016  . Underlying sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, increased   1 percent   (  $168 million  ) on higher volume and slightly lower price. Acquisitions added   4 percent   (  $628 million  ) while foreign currency translation subtracted   $54 million  . Underlying sales increased   2 percent   in the U.S. and were flat internationally. Sales increased   $441 million   in Automation Solutions and   $302 million   in Commercial   Residential Solutions.  
    
  Net sales for   2016   were   $14.5 billion  , a decrease of   $1,727 million  , or   11 percent   compared with   2015  . Underlying sales decreased   7 percent   (  $1,046 million  ) on 6 percent lower volume and 1 percent lower price. Foreign currency translation subtracted   2 percent   (  $266 million  ) and divestitures, net of acquisitions subtracted   2 percent   (  $415 million  ).  Underlying sales decreased 5 percent in the U.S. and 8 percent internationally. Sales in Automation Solutions decreased   $1,176 million   and Commercial   Residential solutions decreased   $76 million  . 
    
  INTERNATIONAL SALES 
  Emerson is a global business with international sales representing 52 percent of total sales, including U.S. exports. Although economic conditions are currently soft worldwide, the Company generally expects faster economic growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Africa in the future.  
    
  International destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased   5 percent  , to   $8.0 billion   in 2017, reflecting increases in both the Automation Solutions and Commercial   Residential Solutions businesses. U.S. exports of   $927 million   were up   4 percent   compared with 2016, reflecting increases in both Automation Solutions, which benefited from the valves   controls acquisition, and Commercial   Residential Solutions. Underlying international destination sales were flat, as foreign currency translation had a 1 percent unfavorable impact, while acquisitions had a 6 percent favorable impact on the comparison. Underlying sales were down   1 percent   in Europe and up   6 percent   in Asia (China up 15 percent). Underlying sales decreased   12 percent   in Latin America,   3 percent   in Canada and   6 percent   in Middle East/Africa. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $7.2 billion in 2017, up 6 percent compared with 2016, primarily reflecting the valves   controls acquisition. 
    
  International destination sales, including U.S. exports, decreased 12 percent, to $7.6 billion in 2016, reflecting decreases in all segments, partially due to divestitures. U.S. exports of $888 million were down 25 percent compared with 2015, reflecting reduced spending by global oil and gas customers, weakness in industrial spending and the stronger U.S. dollar. Underlying international destination sales declined 8 percent, as foreign currency translation and divestitures had a 3 percent and a 1 percent unfavorable impact, respectively, on the comparison. Underlying sales were up 2 percent in Europe and decreased 10 percent in both Asia and Latin America. Sales decreased 21 percent in Canada and 15 percent in Middle East/Africa. Weakness in energy-related and industrial end markets and global economic uncertainty challenged growth in these areas. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $6.8 billion in 2016, down 10 percent compared with 2015, reflecting the weakness in industrial capital spending, unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures. 
    
  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
  The Company is currently pursuing a potential acquisition of Rockwell Automation, Inc.  On November 16, 2017, the Company announced that it proposed to acquire Rockwell for $29 billion, or $225 per share, consisting of $135 per share in cash, financed primarily with newly issued debt, and $90 per share in Emerson stock, which would result in Rockwell shareholders owning approximately 22 percent of the combined company. Rockwell has not engaged with the Company on this or previous proposals. Rockwell had fiscal 2017 sales of approximately $6.3 billion. See Item 1A - "Risk Factors" for additional information.

On April 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Pentair's valves   controls business for $2.960 billion, net of cash acquired of $207 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This business, with annualized sales of approximately   $1.4 billion  , is a manufacturer of control, isolation and pressure relief valves and actuators, and complements the Valves, Actuators   Regulators product offering within Automation Solutions. The Company also acquired two smaller businesses in the Automation Solutions segment. Total cash paid for all businesses was $3.0 billion, net of cash acquired. See Note 3. 
    
  On October 2, 2017, the Company sold its residential storage business for $200 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, and expects to recognize a loss of approximately $40 million in 2018 due to income taxes resulting from nondeductible goodwill. The Company expects to realize approximately $140 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. This business, with sales of $298 million and pretax earnings of   $15 million   in 2017, is a leader in home organization and storage systems, and was reported within the Tools   Home Products segment. 
    
  The Company acquired six businesses in 2016, four in Automation Solutions and two in Climate Technologies. Total cash paid for these businesses was $132 million, net of cash acquired.  Annualized sales for these businesses were approximately $51 million in 2016. The Company completed   eight   acquisitions in 2015, seven in Automation Solutions and one in Tools   Home Products, which had combined annualized sales of approximately   $115 million  . Total cash paid for all businesses was   $324 million  , net of cash acquired.   
    
  In January 2015, the Company completed the sale of its mechanical power transmission solutions business for   $1.4 billion  , and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of   $939 million   (  $532 million   after-tax,   $0.78   per share). Proceeds from the divestiture were used for share repurchase. This business was previously reported in the former Industrial Automation segment, and had partial year sales of   $189 million   in 2015 and related pretax earnings of   $21 million  . Power transmission solutions designs and manufactures market-leading couplings, bearings, conveying components and gearing and drive components, and provides supporting services and solutions. 
    
  On September 30, 2015, the Company sold its InterMetro commercial storage business for   $411 million   in cash and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of   $100 million   (  $79 million   after-tax,   $0.12   per share). This business was previously reported in the former Commercial   Residential Solutions segment, and had annual sales of   $288 million   and pretax earnings of   $42 million   in 2015. InterMetro is a leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service, commercial products and health care industries.  
    
  COST OF SALES 
  Cost of sales for   2017   were   $8.9 billion  , an increase of   $600 million   compared with   $8.3 billion   in   2016  . The increase reflects the acquisition of the valves   controls business and higher volume, partially offset by cost reduction actions and the impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit was   $6.4 billion   in   2017   compared to   $6.3 billion   in   2016  . Gross margin of   42.0 percent   reflected dilution of 1.2 percentage points due to the valves   controls operations and first year acquisition accounting charges of $74 million related to inventory. Slightly lower price also contributed to the decline, while savings from cost reduction actions partially offset these decreases. Gross profit margin was   43.1 percent   in 2016. 
    
  Cost of sales for   2016   were   $8.3 billion  , a decrease of   $981 million   compared with   $9.2 billion   in   2015  , primarily due to reduced sales volume, the impact of foreign currency translation ($186 million) and prior year divestitures ($273 million). Gross profit was   $6.3 billion   in   2016   compared with   $7.0 billion   in   2015  . Gross margin of   43.1 percent   was flat compared with 2015, as savings from cost reduction and containment actions were offset by deleverage on lower volume and unfavorable mix.  
    
  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses of   $3.6 billion   in   2017   increased   $154 million   compared with   2016  , primarily due to the valves   controls acquisition. Savings from cost reduction actions and lower incentive stock compensation of   $35 million  , reflecting the impact of changes in the stock price, were partially offset by higher other costs.  SG A as a percent of sales of   23.7 percent   decreased 0.1 percentage points compared with 2016. 
    
  SG A expenses of   $3.5 billion   in   2016   decreased   $271 million   compared with   2015  . The decrease reflects savings from cost reduction actions, reduced costs from lower sales volume, and prior year divestitures ($137 million), partially offset by higher incentive stock compensation of   $121 million  . SG A as a percent of sales of   23.8 percent   increased 0.8 percent in 2016, reflecting deleverage on lower sales volume and higher incentive stock compensation, primarily due to changes in the stock price and overlap of awards, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.

GAINS ON DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES 
  In 2015, the Company sold its power transmission solutions and commercial storage businesses and recorded  pretax gains of   $939 million   (  $532 million   after-tax,   $0.78   per share) and   $100 million   (  $79 million   after-tax,   $0.12   per share), respectively. See Note 3.  
    
  OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET 
  Other deductions, net were   $286 million   in   2017  , a decrease of   $8 million   compared with 2016. The decrease primarily reflects favorable foreign currency transactions comparisons of   $78 million   (unfavorable in the prior year) and lower restructuring expense of   $18 million  . These decreases were substantially offset by intangibles and backlog amortization related to the valves   controls acquisition of $29 million and $19 million, respectively, and higher acquisition/divestiture costs of   $24 million  . Additionally, 2016 results included a $21 million gain from payments received related to dumping duties. See Note 5. 
    
  Other deductions, net were   $294 million   in   2016  , a   $36 million   decrease from   2015   primarily due to lower restructuring costs of   $42 million  , decreased litigation costs of $30 million and a $21 million gain on payments received related to dumping duties. The decrease in other deductions was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transactions of $67 million.  
    
  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
  Interest expense, net was   $165 million  ,   $188 million   and   $175 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease of   $23 million   in 2017 reflects the maturity of long-term debt with relatively higher interest rates and higher interest income.  
    
  INCOME TAXES 
  Income taxes were   $660 million  ,   $697 million   and   $1,267 million   for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of   28 percent  ,   30 percent   and   33 percent   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The 2 percentage point decrease versus the prior year is largely due to tax benefits from restructuring a foreign subsidiary. The 3 percentage point higher rate in 2015 was due to taxes on the gains from the divestitures of the power transmission solutions and commercial storage businesses. 
    
  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
  Earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in   2017   were   $1,643 million  , up   3 percent   compared with   2016  , and diluted earnings per share were   $2.54   in   2017  , up   4 percent  .   Valves   controls reduced both comparisons by 6 percentage points, or     $97 million  , $0.15 per share, including restructuring expense, intangibles amortization, and first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog of $93 million ($65 million after-tax, $0.10 per share) which are reported in Corporate and other.     Earnings increased   $66 million   in the Automation Solutions segment in   2017   and   $72 million   in Commercial   Residential Solutions. See the Business discussion that follows and Note 18. 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in   2016   were   $1,590 million  , down   37 percent   compared with   2015  , and diluted earnings per share were   $2.45  , down 34 percent. Divestiture gains in the prior year negatively impacted earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share comparisons by 20 and 21 percentage points, respectively. In   2016  , earnings decreased   $390 million   in the Automation Solutions segment and increased   $87 million   in Commercial   Residential Solutions.  
    
  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
  On November 30, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its network power systems business for $4.0 billion in cash and retained a subordinated interest in distributions, contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. This business comprised the former Network Power segment. Additionally, on January 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its power generation, motors and drives business for approximately $1.2 billion, subject to post-closing adjustments. This business was previously reported in the former Industrial Automation segment. The results of operations for these businesses were reported in discontinued operations for all years presented, and the assets and liabilities were reflected as held-for-sale. See Note 4 and Item 1A - "Risk Factors." 
    
  Discontinued operations was a net loss of $125 million in 2017, and income of $45 million and $193 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, the net loss of $125 million, $0.19 per share, included an after-tax gain on the divestiture of the network power systems business of $125 million, a $173 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of  
  
   19 

the power generation, motors and drives business, income tax expense of $109 million for repatriation of sales proceeds, and lower expense of $32 million primarily due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Operating cash flow used by discontinued operations was   $778 million   for 2017, which primarily included payments of approximately $700 million for income taxes on completion of the divestitures and repatriation of cash, cash used by operations and other costs. Capital expenditures were $  20 million  . 
    
  Discontinued operations income of $45 million, $0.07 per share, in 2016 included earnings from operations of $344 million and costs to execute the portfolio repositioning of $299 million. These costs are comprised of income tax expense of $143 million for repatriation of cash from these businesses, reorganization of their legal structures prior to sale, and basis differences for book and tax, as well as costs for legal, consulting, investment banking and other expenses of $77 million. In addition, net earnings for 2016 included a loss of $103 million to write down the power generation, motors and drives business to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of $24 million due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Discontinued operations income of $193 million, $0.28 per share, in 2015 included earnings from operations of $245 million and separation costs of $52 million, comprised of income tax expense of $42 million and fees of $10 million. Operating cash flow from discontinued operations was   $382 million   (net of payments of $179 million for separation costs) and   $489 million   for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures were   $76 million   for 2016 and   $97 million   for 2015.  
    
  NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE; RETURNS ON EQUITY AND TOTAL CAPITAL 
  Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in   2017   were   $1,518 million  , down   7 percent   compared with   2016  , and diluted earnings per share were   $2.35  , down   7 percent  . These results include the impact of discontinued operations discussed above which negatively impacted net earnings and earnings per share comparisons 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively.  
    
  Net earnings attributable to common stockholders in   2016   were   $1,635 million  , down   40 percent   compared with   2015  , and diluted earnings per share were   $2.52  , down   37 percent  . Net earnings and earnings per share comparisons were negatively impacted approximately 24 percentage points due to divestiture gains of $611 million ($0.90 per share) in 2015 and discontinued operations in both years.  
    
  Return on common stockholders' equity (net earnings attributable to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders' equity) was   18.6 percent   in   2017   compared with   20.9 percent   in   2016   and   29.8 percent   in   2015  . Return on total capital was   15.3 percent   in   2017   compared with   15.5 percent   in   2016   and   22.8 percent   in   2015   (computed as net earnings attributable to common stockholders excluding after-tax net interest expense, divided by average common stockholders' equity plus short- and long-term debt less cash and short-term investments). Discontinued operations and the acquisition of the valves   controls business reduced the 2017 return on common stockholders' equity approximately 19 percentage points and return on total capital 11 percentage points. Discontinued operations reduced the 2016 return on common stockholders' equity approximately 23 percentage points and return on total capital 9 percentage points. For 2015, the combined impact of the divestiture gains and discontinued operations reduced the return on common stockholders' equity approximately 12 percentage points and return on total capital 3 percentage points.  

Business Segments 
  Following is an analysis of segment results for   2017   compared with   2016  , and   2016   compared with   2015  . The Company defines segment earnings as earnings before interest and income taxes. In connection with the strategic portfolio repositioning actions completed in fiscal 2017, the Company began reporting three segments: Automation Solutions, and Climate Technologies and Tools   Home Products which together comprise the Commercial   Residential Solutions business. See Note 18. 

20 

2017     vs.     2016   - Automation Solutions reported sales of   $9.4 billion   in   2017  , an increase of   $441 million  , or   5 percent  . Underlying sales decreased   1 percent   (  $128 million  ) on lower volume and slightly lower price. The valves   controls acquisition added   7 percent   (  $603 million  ), while foreign currency translation subtracted   1 percent   (  $34 million  ). Sales for Measurement   Analytical Instrumentation decreased   2 percent   and Process Control Systems   Solutions decreased   4 percent   due to weakness in energy-related markets, but began to improve in the second half of the year as oil prices stabilized. Valves, Actuators   Regulators increased   $531 million  , or   25 percent  , due to the valves   controls acquisition. Industrial Solutions sales increased   $59 million  , or   4 percent  , on improving economic conditions and industrial end markets, especially automotive. Chemical, power and life sciences were favorable. Underlying sales increased   1 percent   in the U.S., were down   2 percent   in Europe and increased   1 percent   in Asia (China up   9 percent  ). Latin America decreased   20 percent  , Canada decreased   6 percent   and Middle East/Africa was down   6 percent  . Earnings of   $1.5 billion   increased   $66 million   from the prior year. Savings from cost reduction actions and favorable foreign currency transactions comparisons of $64 million (unfavorable in the prior year) were partially offset by lower volume, and $25 million of restructuring expense and $29 million of intangibles amortization related to the valves   controls acquisition. Materials cost containment offset lower price. Margin was flat, primarily reflecting the benefit from cost reduction actions offset by dilution from the valves   controls acquisition of 1.5 percentage points. Strong order rates in the second half of the year were supported by broad-based momentum across end markets and regions. Going forward, strong demand for MRO and mid-sized projects together with increasing momentum in international markets supports the outlook for solid underlying growth in fiscal 2018. 
    
  2016     vs.     2015   - Automation Solutions reported sales of   $9.0 billion   in   2016  , a decrease of   $1.2 billion   or   12 percent  . Underlying sales decreased   10 percent   (  $1,027 million  ) on 9 percent lower volume and 1 percent lower price as global oil and gas customers continued to curtail spending levels in a difficult environment.  Foreign currency translation had a   2 percent   (  $206 million  ) unfavorable impact, while acquisitions added   $57 million  . Sales for Measurement   Analytical Instrumentation, Valves, Actuators   Regulators, and Process Control Systems   Solutions decreased   13 percent  ,   16 percent   and   5 percent  , respectively, compared with the prior year. These decreases reflect lower capital and operational spending by global oil and gas customers, particularly in upstream markets, while sales growth was positive in life sciences and power. Industrial Solutions sales decreased   9 percent   on weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas markets. Underlying sales decreased   10 percent   in the U.S., were up   2 percent   in Europe and decreased   13 percent   in Asia (China down   16 percent  ). Latin America decreased   13 percent  , Canada was down   26 percent   and Middle East/Africa decreased   18 percent  . Earnings of   $1.5 billion   decreased   $390 million   and margin was down   2.0   percentage points due to sharply lower volume, deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by savings from cost reduction actions and lower restructuring costs of   $22 million  . Materials cost containment offset lower pricing. Results also reflect unfavorable foreign currency transactions of $65 million, partially offset by a favorable comparison from litigation costs of $20 million in 2015.  

21 

2017     vs.     2016   - Commercial   Residential Solutions sales were   $5.9 billion   in   2017  , an increase of   $302 million  , or   5 percent  , reflecting favorable conditions in HVAC and refrigeration markets in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as U.S. and Asian construction markets. Underlying sales increased   5 percent   (  $297 million  ) on 6 percent higher volume, partially offset by 1 percent lower price. Foreign currency translation deducted   $20 million   and acquisitions added   $25 million  . Climate Technologies sales were   $4.2 billion   in 2017, an increase of   $268 million  , or   7 percent  . Global air conditioning sales were solid, led by strength in the U.S. and Asia and robust growth in China partially due to easier comparisons, while sales were up modestly in Europe and declined moderately in Middle East/Africa. Global refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting robust growth in China on increased adoption of energy-efficient solutions and slight growth in the U.S.  Sensors and solutions had strong growth, while temperature controls was up modestly. Tools   Home Products sales were   $1.6 billion   in 2017, up   $34 million   compared to the prior year. Professional tools had strong growth on favorable demand from oil and gas customers and in other construction related markets. Wet/dry vacuums sales were up moderately as favorable conditions continued in U.S. construction markets. Food waste disposers increased slightly, while the storage business declined moderately. Overall, underlying sales increased   3 percent   in the U.S.,   4 percent   in Europe and   17 percent   in Asia (China up   27 percent  ). Sales increased   3 percent   in Latin America and   4 percent   in Canada, while sales decreased   5 percent   in Middle East/Africa. Earnings were   $1.4 billion  , an increase of   $72 million   driven by Climate Technologies, while margin was flat. Increased volume and resulting leverage, savings from cost reduction actions, and lower customer accommodation costs of $16 million were largely offset by higher materials costs, lower price and unfavorable product mix. In fiscal 2018, global demand is expected to remain favorable in air conditioning, refrigeration and construction markets, supporting the outlook for moderate underlying growth. 
    
  2016     vs.     2015   - Commercial   Residential Solutions sales were   $5.6 billion   in   2016  , a decrease of   $76 million  , or   1 percent  . Underlying sales decreased less than 1 percent (down   $21 million  ) on lower price, offset by slightly higher volume. Foreign currency translation deducted   1 percent   (  $60 million  ), while acquisitions added   $5 million  . Climate Technologies sales were   $3.9 billion   in 2016, a decrease of   $62 million  , or   2 percent  . Global air conditioning sales were down while global refrigeration sales were up modestly, as the U.S. exhibited growth and Europe and China were down, with more significant declines in air conditioning. Sales of temperature controls, sensors and solutions decreased. Tools   Home Products sales were   $1.6 billion   in 2016, down   $14 million   compared to the prior year. Food waste disposers had solid sales growth and the wet/dry vacuums business was up modestly, while sales decreased moderately in the professional tools and storage businesses. Overall, underlying sales were up   1 percent   in the U.S. and   3 percent   in Europe, while Asia decreased   4 percent  . Latin America decreased   3 percent  , Canada was down   4 percent  , and Middle East/Africa decreased   3 percent  . Earnings of   $1.3 billion   increased $  87 million   and margin improved   1.9   percentage points, primarily due to savings from cost reduction actions, materials cost containment and lower restructuring costs of   $24 million  , partially offset by lower price and higher customer accommodation costs.

Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and has the resources available to reinvest for growth in existing businesses, pursue strategic acquisitions and manage its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. 

Operating cash flow from continuing operations for   2017   was   $2.7 billion  , a   $191 million  , or   8 percent   increase compared with   2016  , reflecting higher earnings and favorable changes in working capital. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of   $2.5 billion   in   2016   was a   23 percent   increase compared to   $2.0 billion   in   2015  , as comparisons benefited from income taxes of $424 million paid on the gains from divestitures in 2015. At   September 30, 2017  , operating working capital as a percent of sales increased to   6.6 percent   due to higher levels of working capital in the acquired valves   controls business, compared with   5.2 percent   and   7.2 percent   in   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Operating cash flow from continuing operations funded capital expenditures of   $476 million  , dividends of   $1,239 million  , common stock purchases of   $400 million  , and was also used to partially pay down debt in 2017. Proceeds of $5.1 billion from the sales of the network power systems and power generation, motors and drives businesses funded acquisitions of   $2,990 million  , cash used for discontinued operations of $778 million and repayments of short-term borrowings and long-term debt of approximately $1.3 billion. Contributions to pension plans were   $45 million   in   2017  ,   $66 million   in   2016   and   $53 million   in   2015  .

Free cash flow from continuing operations (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was   $2.2 billion   in   2017  , up   8 percent  . Free cash flow was   $2.1 billion   in   2016  , compared with   $1.5 billion   in   2015  . The Company is targeting capital spending of approximately $550 million in   2018  . Net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was   $2,990 million  ,   $132 million   and   $324 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Proceeds from divestitures not classified as discontinued operations were   $39 million   in 2017 and   $1,812 million   in   2015  .   
    
  Dividends were   $1,239 million   (  $1.92   per share) in   2017  , compared with   $1,227 million   (  $1.90   per share) in   2016   and   $1,269 million   (  $1.88   per share) in   2015  . In November   2017  , the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent, to an annualized rate of $1.94 per share. 
    
  Purchases of Emerson common stock totaled   $400 million  ,   $601 million   and   $2,487 million   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, at average per share prices of $60.51, $48.11 and $57.68. 
    
  The Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million common shares in November 2015, and 56.9 million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization. The Company purchased 6.6 million shares in   2017   under the November 2015 authorization. In 2016, the Company purchased 12.5 million shares under a combination of the November 2015 authorization and the remainder of the May 2013 authorization. A total of 43.1 million shares were purchased in 2015 under the May 2013 authorization.

Total debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was   $4.7 billion  ,   $6.6 billion   and $6.8 billion for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the year, the Company repaid   $250 million   of   5.125%   notes that matured in December 2016. In 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 2.625% notes due December 2021 and $500 million of 3.150% notes due June 2025, and repaid $250 million of 5.0% notes that matured in December 2014 and $250 million of 4.125% notes that matured in April 2015.  
    
  The total debt-to-capital ratio and the net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) decreased in   2017   due to lower total debt outstanding and higher common stockholders' equity from changes in other comprehensive income. The total debt-to-capital ratio and the net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) increased in   2016   due to lower common stockholders' equity from share repurchases and changes in other comprehensive income. The operating cash flow from continuing operations-to-debt ratio increased in   2017   primarily due to lower debt in the current year. The operating cash flow from continuing operations-to-debt ratio increased in 2016 primarily due to taxes paid in 2015 on the divestiture gains and lower debt in 2016. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The increase in interest coverage in   2017   reflects lower interest expense in the current year. The decrease in interest coverage in   2016   reflects lower pretax earnings, largely due to the divestiture gains of $1,039 million in 2015, and slightly higher interest expense. 
    
  In April 2014, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the December 2010 $2.75 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowing. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale. 
    
  Emerson's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. At   September 30, 2017  , $3.1 billion of the Company's cash was held outside the U.S. (primarily in Europe and Asia), $1.4 billion of which income taxes have been provided for, and was generally available for repatriation to the U.S.  Under current tax law, repatriated cash may be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits. The Company routinely repatriates a portion of its non-U.S. cash from earnings each year, or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently, and provides for U.S. income taxes as appropriate. The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity or backup credit lines.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  At   September 30, 2017  , the Company's contractual obligations, including estimated payments, are as follows: 

Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements. The table above does not include   $2.0 billion   of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in Note 19, which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities, deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits, because it is not certain when these amounts will become due. See Notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and Note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes.  
    
  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 8 through 10.  

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
    
  REVENUE RECOGNITION 
  The Company recognizes a large majority of its revenue through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and collection is reasonably assured. In certain circumstances, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, as performance occurs, or in accordance with ASC 985-605 related to software. Sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements, which requires management judgment that affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized. In these instances, the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the Company's control, or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment. The vast majority of deliverables are tangible products, with a smaller portion attributable to installation, service or maintenance. Management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue. 
    
  INVENTORIES 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs, which approximate average costs, while the remainder is principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating  
  
   25 

variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold. The Company's businesses review inventory for obsolescence, make appropriate provisions and dispose of obsolete inventory on a regular basis. Various factors are considered in these reviews, including sales history and recent trends, industry conditions and general economic conditions. If actual circumstances indicate a decline in any of these factors, particularly an abrupt change in economic conditions, the Company could incur higher levels of obsolescence expense. 
    
  LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
  Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations.  
    
  RETIREMENT PLANS  
  The Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. Management believes the assumptions used are appropriate; however, actual experience may differ. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016. The principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured current employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016. Affected employees transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution plan. See Notes 11 and 12. 
    
  During 2017, the funded status of the Company's pension plans improved by $667 million. As of   September 30, 2017  , the U.S. pension plans were underfunded by   $77 million   in total, including unfunded plans totaling   $201 million  . The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by   $253 million  , including unfunded plans totaling   $215 million  . The Company contributed a total of   $45 million   to defined benefit plans in   2017   and expects to contribute approximately   $60 million   in   2018  . At year-end   2017  , the discount rate for U.S. plans was   3.76 percent  , and was   3.50 percent   in   2016  . The assumed investment return on plan assets was   7.25 percent   in   2017   and   7.50 percent   in   2016   and   2015  , and is expected to be 7.0 percent for 2018. Deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were   $1,161 million   ($753 million after-tax) as of   September 30, 2017  .  
    
  INCOME TAXES 
  Income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies. 
    
  Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained  
  
   26 

upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. 
    
  The Company also pays U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits, on cash repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries where these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 14. 
    
  Other Items 
    
  LEGAL MATTERS 
  At   September 30, 2017  , there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business. 
    
  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In May 2014, the FASB amended ASC 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , to update and consolidate revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers. The fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Also required are additional disclosures regarding the nature, extent, timing and uncertainty of revenues and associated cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company currently expects to adopt the new standard prospectively with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized in retained earnings. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the revised standard and does not currently expect that the updates will materially impact its financial statements. The Company is also in the process of evaluating and implementing changes to its business processes, systems, controls and accounting policies to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB amended ASC 842,   Leases  , to require recognition on the balance sheet of assets and liabilities related to the rights and obligations associated with all lease arrangements. Currently, obligations classified as operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet but must be disclosed. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard on its financial statements. The Company expects the revised standard to have a material impact on its balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases. Contractual obligations related to operating leases totaled   $536 million   at September 30, 2017. The Company does not expect the new standard will materially impact its results of operations. 
    
  In March 2017, the FASB issued updates to ASC 715,   Compensation - Retirement Benefits  , which only permit the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions. These updates are effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company s results of operations.  
  In August 2017, the FASB issued updates to ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , which permit hedging contractually specified risk components. The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements. These updates are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard on its financial statements.  
  In January 2017, the FASB issued updates to ASC 350,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  , eliminating the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. These updates are effective prospectively for impairment tests beginning in fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted, and are not expected to materially impact the Company s results of operations.

FISCAL 2018 OUTLOOK  
  Market conditions began trending favorably in the second half of fiscal 2017 and are expected to continue into 2018. Oil and gas prices are expected to remain stable in a range favorable for energy-related markets, while growth in air conditioning, refrigeration and global construction markets is expected to continue. Automation Solutions net sales are expected to be up 14 to 16 percent, with underlying sales up 5 to 7 percent excluding an approximate 8 percent impact from acquisitions and 1 percent from currency translation. Commercial   Residential Solutions net sales are expected to be down 1 percent to up 1 percent, with underlying sales up 3 to 5 percent excluding an approximate 5 percent negative impact from divestitures and 1 percent from favorable currency translation. Consolidated net sales are expected to be up 8 to 10 percent, with underlying sales up 4 to 6 percent, excluding an approximate 3 percent impact from acquisitions and divestitures and 1 percent from currency translation. Reported earnings per share are expected to be $2.66 to $2.86. Earnings per share are expected to be $2.75 to $2.95, excluding a $0.03 impact from valves   controls first year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog amortization, and a $0.06 impact from a tax-related loss on the divestiture of the residential storage business.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Financial Statement Presentation 
  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. 
  In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted updates to ASC Subtopic 835-30,   Interest-Imputation of Interest  , which require presentation of debt issuance costs as a deduction from the related debt liability rather than within other assets. These updates were adopted on a retrospective basis and did not materially impact the Company s financial statements.  
  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company adopted updates to ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  ,     which require all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based payments to be recognized in income tax expense rather than through additional paid-in-capital, and to be presented as operating cash flows instead of financing. These updates did not materially impact the Company's financial statements.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company adopted updates to ASC 740,   Income Taxes  , which require noncurrent presentation of all deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. These updates were adopted on a prospective basis and resulted in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent presentation. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company adopted updates to ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , which require investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient to be removed from the fair value hierarchy and separately reported when making disclosures. These updates did not change the determination of fair value for any investments. Adoption affected disclosure presentation only; there was no impact on the Company s financial results. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company adopted updates to ASC 205,   Presentation of Financial Statements  , and ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  , regarding the reporting of discontinued operations. These updates raised the threshold for reporting discontinued operations to a strategic business shift having a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The updates also added disclosures for disposals of business units qualifying for discontinued presentation, and for some dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations but are still considered individually significant components of the entity. In 2017, the Company completed the divestitures of its network power systems, and power generation, motors and drives businesses. The results of operations for these businesses were reported within discontinued operations for all years presented, and the assets and liabilities were reflected as held-for-sale. See Note 4. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments of   20 percent   to   50 percent   of the voting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in publicly traded companies of less than   20 percent   are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than   20 percent   are carried at cost. 
    
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
    
  Cash Equivalents 
  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
  
   34 

Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs, which approximate average costs, while the remainder is principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold. Following are the components of inventory as of September 30: 

The increase is primarily due to the valves   controls acquisition. See Note 3. 
    
  Fair Value Measurement 
  ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.  
    
  Property, Plant And Equipment 
  The Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are   30   to   40 years   for buildings and   8   to   12 years   for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values. The components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow: 

The increase is primarily due to the valves   controls acquisition. See Note 3. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Substantially all goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that acquires a business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280,   Segment Reporting  , or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value.  
  
   35 

If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recognized to the extent that recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates.  
    
  All of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 7. 
    
  Product Warranty 
  Warranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties generally extend for a period of   one   to   two   years from the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty are determined primarily based on historical warranty cost as a percentage of sales or a fixed amount per unit sold based on failure rates, adjusted for specific problems that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than   one percent   of sales.   
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company recognizes a large majority of its revenues through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and collection is reasonably assured. Less than   ten percent   of the Company's revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as performance occurs, and revenue from software sales is recognized in accordance with ASC 985-605. Management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue. 
    
  Sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements. In these instances, the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the Company's control, or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment. Approximately   five percent   of the Company's revenues from continuing operations arise from qualifying sales arrangements that include the delivery of multiple elements, principally in the Automation Solutions segment. The vast majority of these deliverables are tangible products, with a smaller portion attributable to installation, service or maintenance. Generally, contract duration is short term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and have historically not been invoked.  
    
  Derivatives and Hedging 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence and diverse business profile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, Singapore dollars and Indian rupees. Primary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related products. As part of the Company's risk management strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally   two years   or less.  
    
  All derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, the effective portion of any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives that are designated as hedges and qualify for deferral accounting are cash flow hedges. For derivatives hedging the fair value of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that have been designated as hedges of non-U.S. dollar net asset exposures are reported in equity. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge economic exposures that do not receive deferral accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to purchases of commodity-based components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, and the revaluation  
  
   36 

of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains or losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge, as well as any gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedges, are recognized in the income statement immediately. 
    
  Counterparties to derivative arrangements are companies with high credit ratings, and the Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with them for which credit rating-based posting thresholds vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below preestablished levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization on all instruments in net liability positions.   No   collateral was posted with counterparties and   none   was held by the Company at year end. If contractual thresholds had been exceeded, the maximum collateral the Company could have been required to post was   $4  . The Company can also demand full collateralization of instruments in net asset positions should any of the Company's counterparties' credit ratings fall below certain thresholds. Risk from credit loss when derivatives are in asset positions is not considered material. The Company has master netting arrangements in place with its counterparties that allow the offsetting of certain derivative-related amounts receivable and payable when settlement occurs in the same period. Accordingly, counterparty balances are netted in the consolidated balance sheet and are reported in other current assets or accrued expenses as appropriate, depending on positions with counterparties as of the balance sheet date. See Note 8. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes is based on pretax income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings and tax rates currently enacted in each jurisdiction. Certain income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and income tax filing purposes, and deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences. The Company also provides for U.S. federal income taxes, net of available foreign tax credits, on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on approximately   $4.9 billion   of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2017  , as these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of U.S. taxes on undistributed non-U.S. earnings would be triggered by a management decision to repatriate those earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Note 14. 

(2)  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES 
    
  Basic earnings per common share consider only the weighted-average of common shares outstanding while diluted earnings per common share also consider the dilutive effects of stock options and incentive shares. Options to purchase approximately   4.5 million  ,   13.3 million   and   5.9 million   shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, as the effect would have been antidilutive. Earnings allocated to participating securities were inconsequential for all years presented. Reconciliations of weighted-average shares for basic and diluted earnings per common share follow (shares in millions):   

(3)  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
    
  On April 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Pentair's valves   controls business for   $2.960 billion  , net of cash acquired of   $207  , subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This business, with annualized sales of approximately   $1.4 billion  , is a manufacturer of control, isolation and pressure relief valves and actuators, and complements the Valves, Actuators   Regulators product offering within Automation Solutions. The Company recognized goodwill of   $1,472   (  none   of which is expected to be tax deductible), and other identifiable intangible assets of   $1,045  , primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average life of approximately   fifteen   years. The Company also acquired   two   smaller businesses in the Automation Solutions segment. Total cash paid for all businesses was   $3.0 billion  , net of cash acquired. 

37 

The purchase price of the valves   controls business was preliminarily allocated to assets and liabilities as follows. Valuations of acquired assets and liabilities are in-process and subject to refinement. 

Results of operations for 2017 included sales of   $600   and a net loss of   $97  , $  0.15   per share, including restructuring expense of   $25   and intangibles amortization of   $29  .   These results also included first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to inventory of     $74     and backlog of     $19  , or a total of     $93   (  $65   after-tax, $  0.10   per share),   which are reported in Corporate and other. See Note 18. 
    
  Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the acquisition of the valves   controls business occurred on October 1, 2015. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred as of that time.           

The pro forma results for 2016 were adjusted to include first year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog of $  122   in 2017. The pro forma 2016 results also include acquisition costs of $  52  , while the 2017 pro forma results were adjusted to exclude these charges.  
    
  On October 2, 2017, the Company sold its residential storage business for   $200   in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, and expects to recognize a loss of approximately   $40   in 2018 due to income taxes resulting from nondeductible goodwill. The Company expects to realize approximately   $140   in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. This business, with sales of   $298   and pretax earnings of   $15   in 2017, is a leader in home organization and storage systems, and was reported within the Tools   Home Products segment. Assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2017.  
    
  The Company acquired   six   businesses in 2016,   four   in Automation Solutions and   two   in Climate Technologies. Total cash paid for these businesses was   $132  , net of cash acquired. Annualized sales for these businesses were approximately   $51   in 2016. The Company recognized goodwill of   $83   (  $27   of which is expected to be tax deductible) and other identifiable intangible assets of   $50  , primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average life of approximately   nine   years.  
    
  The Company completed   eight   acquisitions in 2015,   seven   in Automation Solutions and   one   in Tools   Home Products, which had combined annualized sales of approximately   $115  . Total cash paid for all businesses was   $324  , net of cash acquired. The Company recognized goodwill of   $178   (  $42   of which is expected to be tax deductible) and other intangible assets of   $128  , primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average life of approximately   ten   years.  
    
  In January 2015, the Company completed the sale of its mechanical power transmission solutions business for   $1.4 billion  , and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of   $939   (  $532   after-tax,   $0.78   per share). Assets and liabilities sold were as follows: current assets,   $182   (accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets); other  
  
   38 

assets,   $374   (property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other noncurrent assets); accrued expenses,   $56   (accounts payable, other current liabilities); and other liabilities,   $41  . Proceeds from the divestiture were used for share repurchase. This business was previously reported in the former Industrial Automation segment, and had partial year sales in 2015 of   $189   and related pretax earnings of   $21  . Power transmission solutions designs and manufactures market-leading couplings, bearings, conveying components and gearing and drive components, and provides supporting services and solutions. 
    
  On September 30, 2015, the Company sold its InterMetro commercial storage business for   $411   in cash and recognized a pretax gain from the transaction of   $100   (  $79   after-tax,   $0.12   per share). This business had annual sales of   $288   and pretax earnings of   $42   in 2015 and was reported in the former Commercial   Residential Solutions segment. Assets and liabilities sold were as follows: current assets,   $62   (accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets); other assets,   $292   (property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other noncurrent assets); current liabilities,   $34   (accounts payable, other current liabilities); and other liabilities,   $9  . InterMetro is a leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service, commercial products and health care industries. 
    
  The results of operations of the acquired businesses discussed above have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition. 

(4)  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  In 2017, the Company completed the previously announced strategic actions to streamline its portfolio and drive growth in its core businesses. On November 30, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its network power systems business for   $4.0 billion   in cash and retained a subordinated interest in distributions, contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. This business comprised the former Network Power segment. Additionally, on January 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its power generation, motors and drives business for approximately   $1.2 billion  , subject to post-closing adjustments. This business was previously reported in the former Industrial Automation segment. The results of operations for these businesses were reported within discontinued operations for all years presented, and the assets and liabilities were reflected as held-for-sale.  
    
  The financial results of the network power systems business and power generation, motors and drives business reported as discontinued operations for the years ending September 30,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , were as follows:       

In 2017, the net loss from discontinued operations of   $125  ,   $0.19   per share, included an after-tax gain on the divestiture of the network power systems business of   $125   (  $519   pretax), a   $173   after-tax loss (  $36   pretax loss) on the divestiture of the power generation, motors and drives business, income tax expense of   $109   for repatriation of sales proceeds, and lower expense of   $32   primarily due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale.  
    
  Discontinued operations income of   $45  ,   $0.07   per share, in 2016 included earnings from operations of   $344   and costs to execute the portfolio repositioning of   $299  . These costs are comprised of income tax expense of   $143   for repatriation of cash from these businesses, reorganization of their legal structures prior to sale, and basis differences for book and tax, as well as costs for legal, consulting, investment banking and other expenses of   $77  . In addition, net earnings for 2016 included a loss of   $103   to write down the power generation, motors and drives  
  
   39 

business to the sales price less costs to sell, and lower expense of   $24   due to ceasing depreciation and amortization for the discontinued businesses held-for-sale. Discontinued operations income of   $193  ,   $0.28   per share, in 2015 included earnings from operations of   $245   and separation costs of   $52  , comprised of income tax expense of   $42   and fees of   $10  .  
    
  The aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale as of September 30,   2016   are summarized as follows:   

The net cash from operating activities and from investing activities for the network power systems business and the power generation, motors and drives business for the years ending September 30,   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , were as follows:               

Operating cash flow used by discontinued operations was   $778   for 2017, which primarily included payments of approximately   $700   for income taxes on completion of the divestitures and repatriation of cash, cash used by operations and other costs. Operating cash flow from discontinued operations in 2016 was net of payments of   $179   for separation costs. 

(5)  OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET 

Other is composed of several items, including foreign currency transaction gains and losses, bad debt expense, equity investment income and losses, litigation and other items. The decrease in other for   2017   is due to favorable foreign currency transactions comparisons of   $78   (unfavorable in the prior year), partially offset by higher acquisition/divestiture costs of   $24   and the comparative impact of a   $21   gain from payments received related to  
  
   40 

dumping duties in 2016. The increase in   2016   is primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency transactions impact of   $67  , partially offset by lower litigation costs of   $30   and the dumping duties gain.   

(6)  RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
  Each year the Company incurs costs to size its businesses to levels appropriate for current economic conditions and to continually improve its cost structure and operational efficiency, deploy assets globally, and remain competitive on a worldwide basis. Costs result from numerous individual actions implemented across the Company's various operating units on an ongoing basis and can include costs for moving facilities to best-cost locations, restarting plants after relocation or geographic expansion to better serve local markets, reducing forcecount or the number of facilities, exiting certain product lines, and other costs resulting from asset deployment decisions. By category, shutdown costs include severance and benefits, stay bonuses, lease and other contract termination costs and asset write-downs. Vacant facility costs include security, maintenance, utilities and other costs. Start-up and moving costs include the costs of relocating fixed assets and employee training and relocation. 
  Restructuring expenses were   $78  ,   $96   and   $138  , respectively, for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . The 2017 restructuring expense included   $25   related to the acquired valves   controls business. Restructuring activity in 2015 and 2016 was initiated in connection with the slowdown in global capital spending and the Company's strategic portfolio repositioning activities. The Company currently expects   2018   restructuring expense to be approximately   $80  , including costs to complete actions initiated before the end of   2017   and for actions anticipated to be approved and initiated during   2018  .  
    
  Restructuring costs by business segment follows: 

Costs incurred in   2017   primarily related to the deployment of resources to better serve local markets and higher growth areas, and the integration of the valves   controls business. In   2016   and   2015   costs primarily related to the reduction and selective repositioning of the Company s cost structure to address global economic weakness and in connection with the portfolio repositioning through facilities and forcecount rationalization in Europe and North America, primarily in Automation Solutions. In   2017  , restructuring activities included actions to exit   10   production or office facilities worldwide and eliminate approximately   1,200   positions. Expenses incurred in 2016 and 2015 included actions to exit   19   and   12   facilities, and eliminate approximately   1,900   and   3,100   positions, respectively.  
    
  The change in the liability for restructuring costs during the years ended September 30 follows: 

41 

(7)  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 
    
  Purchases of businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method, with substantially all goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that acquires the business. Under an impairment test performed annually, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. Fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures which are estimated generally using an income approach that discounts future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.  
    
  The change in the carrying value of goodwill by business segment follows:    

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class follow: 

Intangible asset amortization expense for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $222  ,   $177   and   $174  , respectively. Based on intangible asset balances as of   September 30, 2017  , amortization expense is expected to approximate   $261   in   2018  ,   $226   in   2019  ,   $201   in   2020  ,   $168   in   2021   and   $148   in   2022  .  
    
  The increase in goodwill and intangibles is primarily due to the valves   controls acquisition. See Note 3.  

42 

(8)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Hedging Activities 
  As of   September 30, 2017  , the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was approximately   $1.8 billion  , while commodity hedge contracts totaled approximately   $115   (primarily   49 million   pounds of copper and aluminum). All derivatives receiving deferral accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of   September 30, 2017   are expected to be recognized over the next   12   months as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives reported in other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receive deferral accounting.  
    
  Amounts included in earnings and other comprehensive income follow:  

Regardless of whether derivatives receive deferral accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be essentially offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving deferral accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial in all years shown. 
    
  Fair Value Measurement 
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt was   $4,385   and   $4,806  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , which exceeded the carrying value by   $321   and   $488  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2017  , the fair value of commodity contracts and foreign currency contracts was reported in other current assets and accrued expenses. Valuations of derivative contract positions as of September 30 follow: 

(9)  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT 
    
  Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 

The Company routinely issues commercial paper as a source of short-term financing. In April 2014, the Company entered into a   $3.5 billion   five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced a December 2010   $2.75 billion   facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowing. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. 
  
   43 

(10)  LONG-TERM DEBT 
    
  The details of long-term debt follow: 

Long-term debt maturing during each of the four years after   2018   is   $683  ,   $516  ,   $299   and   $500  , respectively. Total interest paid on all debt was approximately   $192  ,   $209   and   $196   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the year, the Company repaid   $250   of   5.125%   notes that matured in December 2016. In   2016  , the Company repaid   $250   of   4.75%   notes that matured in October 2015.  
    
  The Company maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale. 

(11)  RETIREMENT PLANS  
    
  Retirement plans expense includes the following components:  

The increase in net periodic pension expense in 2017 is attributable to higher amortization compared to the prior year. Beginning in 2016, the Company refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans. The specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate previously used, are applied to the projected cash flows to provide more  
  
   44 

precise measurement of these costs. This is a change in estimate which has been accounted for prospectively beginning with the 2016 financial statements. The change reduced the 2016 service and interest cost by a total of   $38   compared with the cost measured using the weighted-average approach. Net periodic pension expense includes   $3  ,   $12   and   $14   and defined contribution expense includes   $6  ,   $34   and   $33  , for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to discontinued operations. For defined contribution plans, the Company makes cash contributions based on plan requirements, which are expensed as incurred.  
    
  The Company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016, and current employees not meeting combined age and years of service criteria ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016. Affected employees were enrolled in an enhanced defined contribution plan. The impact of these actions had an inconsequential impact on the Company's financial statements for all years presented. Over time, defined benefit plan expense will decline while defined contribution plan expense will increase, with an expectation of reduced earnings volatility.  
    
  All of the following tables include defined benefit plans related to continuing and discontinued operations. 
    
  Details of the changes in the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans follow:   

45 

Approximately   $142   of the   $1,161   of pretax losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at   September 30, 2017   will be amortized to expense in   2018  . As of   September 30, 2017  , U.S. pension plans were underfunded by   $77   in total, including unfunded plans totaling   $201  . The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by   $253  , including unfunded plans totaling   $215  . 
    
  As of the   September 30, 2017   and   2016   measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation was   $5,607   and   $5,729  , respectively. Also as of the measurement dates, the total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were   $1,182  ,   $1,088   and   $663  , respectively, for   2017  , and   $5,951  ,   $5,678   and   $4,958  , respectively, for   2016  .   
    
  Future benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be   $212   in   2018  ,   $220   in   2019  ,   $228   in   2020  ,   $235   in   2021  ,   $241   in   2022   and   $1,272   in total over the five years 2023 through 2027. Based on foreign currency exchange rates as of   September 30, 2017  , future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be   $56   in 2018,   $57   in 2019,   $59   in 2020,   $63   in 2021,   $68   in 2022 and   $390   in total over the five years 2023 through 2027. The Company expects to contribute approximately   $60   to its retirement plans in   2018  .  
    
  The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits follow: 

The discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was   3.76 percent   as of   September 30, 2017  . An actuarially developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past   10 years   plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.    
    
  The Company's asset allocations at   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , and weighted-average target allocations follow: 

The primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small  
  
   46 

portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential.  
    
  The fair values of defined benefit pension assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement,   follow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.  

Asset Classes 
  U.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S.  Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. High-yield bonds include noninvestment-grade debt from a diverse group of developed market issuers. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.   
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy Categories 
  Valuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. U.S. equity securities classified as Level 3 are fund investments in private companies. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments measured at net asset value are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets.  

47 

Details of the changes in value for Level 3 assets follow: 

(12)  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS 
    
  The Company sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The components of net postretirement benefits expense for the years ended September 30 follow: 

Details of the changes in actuarial present value of accumulated postretirement benefit obligations follow: 

As of   September 30, 2017   there were   $141   of deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which approximately   $19   will be amortized into earnings in   2018  . The discount rates used to measure the benefit obligation as of   September 30, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   3.45 percent  ,   3.10 percent   and   3.80 percent  , respectively. The health care cost trend rate used for both   2018   and   2017   is assumed to be   7.5 percent   initially, and declining to   5.0 percent   over the subsequent   eleven   years. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate assumption for either year would have an inconsequential impact on postretirement benefits expense and the benefit obligation. The Company estimates that future health care benefit payments will be approximately   $14   per year for   2018   through   2022  , and   $60   in total over the five years   2023   through   2027  . 

(13)  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
    
  The Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters; and any related insurance coverage. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is  
  
   48 

held harmless and is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential. 
    
  At   September 30, 2017  , there were   no   known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business. 

(14)  INCOME TAXES 
    
  Pretax earnings from continuing operations consist of the following: 

The principal components of income tax expense follow: 

Reconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate follow: 

Non-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and are expected to expire over the next   five   years.  

49 

Following are changes in unrecognized tax benefits before considering recoverability of any cross-jurisdictional tax credits (federal, state and non-U.S.) and temporary differences. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to change significantly within the next   12   months. 

If none of the unrecognized tax benefits shown is ultimately paid, the tax provision and the calculation of the effective tax rate would be favorably impacted by   $100  , which is net of cross-jurisdictional tax credits and temporary differences. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total interest and penalties recognized were   $(1)  ,   $2   and   $(4)   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , total accrued interest and penalties were   $16   and   $21  , respectively.   
    
  The U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. U.S. federal tax returns are closed through 2013. The status of state and non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 
    
  The principal items that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities follow: 

As of September 30, 2017, all deferred tax assets and liabilities were presented as noncurrent. As of September 30, 2016, current deferred tax assets, net were   $400   and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, net were   $174  . Total income taxes paid were approximately   $1,420  ,   $950   and   $1,590   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Approximately   one-third   of the   $444   of net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely,   one-third   expire in ten years, and the remainder expire over varying periods.

(15)  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  The Company's stock-based compensation plans include stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Although the Company has discretion, shares distributed under these plans are issued from treasury stock.   
    
  Stock Options 
  The Company's stock option plans permit key officers and employees to purchase common stock at specified prices, which are equal to   100 percent   of the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest   one-third   in each of the three years subsequent to grant and expire   10 years   from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the number of options expected to vest. As of   September 30, 2017  ,   11.5 million   options were available for grant under the plans.   
    
  Changes in shares subject to options during the year ended   September 30, 2017   follow (shares in thousands): 

The weighted-average grant date fair value per option was   $8.36  ,   $9.02   and   $12.48   in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash received for option exercises was   $148   in   2017  ,   $31   in   2016   and   $36   in   2015  . The total intrinsic value of options exercised in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $36  ,   $9   and   $16  , respectively, while the tax benefit realized by the Company from tax deductions related to option exercises was   $2  ,   $2   and   $10  , respectively. 
    
  The grant date fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in valuations for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   are, respectively: risk-free interest rate, based on U.S. Treasury yields,   1.7 percent  ,   1.9 percent   and   1.9 percent  ; dividend yield,   3.6 percent  ,   3.8 percent   and   3.1 percent  ; and expected volatility, based on historical volatility,   24 percent  ,   27 percent   and   28 percent  . The expected life of each option awarded is seven years based on historical experience and expected future exercise patterns. 
    
  Performance Shares, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units  
  The Company's incentive shares plans include performance shares awards which distribute the value of common stock to key management employees subject to certain operating performance conditions and other restrictions. The form of distribution is primarily shares of common stock, with a portion in cash. Compensation expense for performance shares is recognized over the service period based on the number of shares ultimately expected to be earned. Performance shares awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  , with compensation expense adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the change in fair value of the awards.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016,   4,944,575   performance shares awarded primarily in 2013 were outstanding, contingent on the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2016 and the provision of additional service by employees. The objectives for these shares were met at the   86 percent   level at the end of 2016, or   4,252,335   shares. Of these,   2,549,083   shares were distributed in early 2017 as follows:   1,393,715   issued as shares,   944,002   withheld for income taxes, and the value of   211,366   paid in cash. An additional   1,691,986   shares were distributed at the end of 2017 to employees who provided one additional year of service as follows:   1,070,264   issued as shares,   616,734   withheld for income taxes, and the value of   4,988   paid in cash. There were   11,266   shares canceled and not distributed.  Additionally, the rights to receive a maximum of   2,388,125   and   2,178,388   common shares awarded in   2017   and 2016, under the new performance shares program, are outstanding and contingent upon the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

51 

Incentive shares plans also include restricted stock awards which involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from three to ten years. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable service period. In   2017  ,   130,641   shares of restricted stock vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements. Consequently,   84,398   shares were issued while   46,243   shares were withheld for income taxes in accordance with minimum withholding requirements. As of   September 30, 2017  , there were   1,194,500   shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding. 
    
  The total fair value of shares vested under incentive shares plans was   $245  ,   $11   and   $9  , respectively, in   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , of which   $101  ,   $4   and   $5   was paid in cash, primarily for tax withholding. As of   September 30, 2017  ,   12.9 million   shares remained available for award under incentive shares plans.  
    
  Changes in shares outstanding but not yet earned under incentive shares plans during the year ended   September 30, 2017   follow (shares in thousands): 

Total compensation expense for stock options and incentive shares was   $115  ,   $159   and   $30   for   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, of which   $5  ,   $14   and   $6   was included in discontinued operations. The decrease in expense for 2017 reflects the impact of changes in the stock price. The increase in expense for 2016 reflects an increasing stock price in the current year compared with a decreasing price in 2015, and overlap of awards. Income tax benefits recognized in the income statement for these compensation arrangements during   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were   $33  ,   $45   and   $2  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2017  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested shares awarded under these plans was   $149  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.5   years. 
    
  In addition to the employee stock option and incentive shares plans, in   2017   the Company awarded   17,984   shares of restricted stock and   2,248   restricted stock units under the restricted stock plan for non-management directors. As of   September 30, 2017  ,   174,335   shares were available for issuance under this plan. 

(16) COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK 
    
  At   September 30, 2017  ,   40.0 million   shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. During   2017  ,   6.6 million   common shares were purchased and   5.5 million   treasury shares were reissued. In   2016  ,   12.5 million   common shares were purchased and   0.7 million   treasury shares were reissued. 
    
  At   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , the Company had   5.4 million   shares of   $2.50   par value preferred stock authorized, with   none   issued.

(18)  BUSINESS SEGMENTS INFORMATION 
    
  The Company designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for customers in a wide range of industrial, commercial and consumer markets around the world.  
  In connection with the strategic portfolio repositioning actions undertaken to transform the Company into a more focused enterprise, its businesses and organization were realigned. In fiscal 2017, the Company began reporting three segments:   Automation Solutions  , and   Climate Technologies   and   Tools   Home Products   which together comprise the   Commercial   Residential Solutions   business. Prior year information has been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Automation Solutions segment includes the former Process Management segment and the remaining businesses in the former Industrial Automation segment, except for the hermetic motors business, which is now included in the Climate Technologies segment. The new Tools   Home Products segment consists of the businesses previously reported in the Commercial   Residential Solutions segment in fiscal 2016 and 2015. 
  The   Automation Solutions   segment enables process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers to maximize production, protect personnel and the environment, and optimize their energy efficiency and operating costs through a broad offering of integrated solutions and products, including measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control systems. Significant end markets serviced include oil and gas, refining, chemicals and power generation, as well as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, automotive, pulp and paper, metals and mining, and municipal water supplies. The segment's major product offerings are described below.  
             
    Measurement   Analytical Instrumentation   products measure the physical properties of liquids or gases in a process stream and communicate this information to a process control system or other software applications, and analyze the chemical composition of process fluids and emissions to enhance quality and efficiency, as well as environmental compliance.  
     
   53 

Valves, Actuators   Regulators   consists of control, isolation and pressure relief valves which respond to commands from a control system to continuously and precisely modulate the flow of process fluids, smart actuation and control technologies, pressure management products, and industrial and residential regulators that reduce the pressure of fluids moving from high-pressure supply lines into lower pressure systems.  
                
    Industrial Solutions   provides fluid power and control mechanisms, electrical distribution equipment, and materials joining and precision cleaning products which are used in a variety of manufacturing operations to provide integrated solutions to customers.  
                
    Process Control Systems   Solutions   provides a digital ecosystem that controls plant processes by communicating with and adjusting the "intelligent" plant devices described above to provide precision measurement, control, monitoring, asset optimization, and plant safety and reliability for plants that produce power, or process fluids or other items.   
     The   Commercial   Residential Solutions   business consists of the Climate Technologies and Tools   Home Products segments. This business provides products and solutions that promote energy efficiency, enhance household and commercial comfort, and protect food quality and sustainability through heating, air conditioning and refrigeration technology, as well as a broad range of tools and appliance solutions.  
  The   Climate Technologies   segment provides products, services and solutions for all areas of the climate control industry, including residential heating and cooling, commercial air conditioning, commercial and industrial refrigeration, and cold chain management. Products include compressors, temperature sensors and controls, thermostats, flow controls, and stationary and mobile remote monitoring technologies and services that enable homeowners and businesses to better manage their heating, air conditioning and refrigeration systems for improved control and comfort, and lower energy costs.  
  The   Tools   Home Products   segment offers tools for professionals and homeowners and appliance solutions. Products include professional pipe-working tools, residential and commercial food waste disposers, and wet-dry vacuums. 
  The principal distribution method for each segment is direct sales forces, although the Company also uses independent sales representatives and distributors. Due to its global presence, certain of the Company's international operations are subject to risks including the stability of governments and business conditions in foreign countries which could result in adverse changes in exchange rates, changes in regulation or disruption of operations. 
    
  The primary income measure used for assessing segment performance and making operating decisions is earnings before interest and income taxes. Intersegment selling prices approximate market prices. Accounting method differences between segment reporting and the consolidated financial statements are primarily management fees allocated to segments based on a percentage of sales and the accounting for pension and other retirement plans. Corporate and other includes corporate operations, stock compensation expense, acquisition related costs and other items. Corporate assets are primarily comprised of cash and equivalents, investments and certain fixed assets. Summarized below is information about the Company's operations by business segment and by geography.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Emerson Electric Co.: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Emerson Electric Co. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended   September 30, 2017  . We also have audited Emerson Electric Co.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2017  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework     (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Emerson Electric Co.'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying   Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  As described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, the valves   controls business was acquired on April 28, 2017 and management has excluded this business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. Valves   controls' total assets and revenues excluded from the assessment represented approximately 20 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of the Company's related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired business. 
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Emerson Electric Co. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2017   and   2016  , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended   September 30, 2017  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Emerson Electric Co. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2017  ,

  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on an evaluation performed, the Company's certifying officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2017   to provide reasonable assurance of achieving these objectives.

 EXHIBIT 10.N

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10(n) 
    
  Summary of Compensation Arrangements with Non-Management Directors 
    
  Each non-management Director is paid an annual retainer in cash and/or restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs), as determined by the Board, as well as a meeting fee for each Board or Committee meeting attended and reimbursement of expenses.  The Lead Independent Director and each of the Committee Chairs receive an additional cash retainer. The amounts are set forth in the Company s proxy statement each year.  Management Directors do not receive any additional compensation for service on the Board.  Directors may defer all or a part of their cash compensation under the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Directors may also defer payment of the dividend equivalents on RSUs.   
    
  The Company s Continuing Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors was terminated on June 4, 2002.  Directors who were serving on the Board as of that date are eligible to continue participation in the plan. These Directors will, after the later of termination of service or age 72, receive $30,000 annually for life, which was the annual cash retainer in effect on that date. If service terminates because of death, the benefit will be paid to the surviving spouse for five years. 
    
  As part of the Company s charitable contributions practice, the Company may, in the Board s discretion, make a charitable contribution in the names of Emerson and a Director (including management Directors) upon retirement from the Board (as determined by the Board), taking into account the Director s Board tenure, accomplishments, and other relevant factors.

Exhibit 10(o) 
    
  Compensation of Named Executive Officers    
    
  The executive officers named in the summary compensation and other tables in the proxy statement for Emerson Electric Co. have their base salaries and annual bonuses determined yearly by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. This ordinarily takes place at a meeting of the Committee in November of each fiscal year, but the base salary determination is typically retroactively effective as of October 1, the first day of the fiscal year. The named executive officers are all  at will  employees, and do not have written or oral employment agreements. The Company, upon the approval of the Committee, retains the right to unilaterally decrease or increase such officers  base salaries at any time during the fiscal year.  
    
  The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the Company s incentive compensation plans as provided in the terms of such plans. Such plans, and any forms of awards thereunder providing for material terms, are filed as exhibits to reports filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are described in detail each year in the Company s proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders.

Exhibit 99.1 
    
  DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
  The following is a summary of the general terms of the capital stock of Emerson Electric Co. (the  Company  or  Emerson ).  This description is a summary, and it does not describe every aspect of our capital stock. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Restated Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws, as amended, and the provisions of the Missouri General and Business Corporation Law, which we refer to as Missouri law, and which may be amended from time to time. 
    As used herein, unless otherwise specified or the context requires otherwise, we use the terms  we,  us  and  our  to refer to the Company. 
  General  
  Our authorized capital stock consists of 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.50 per share, and 5,400,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $2.50 per share.  There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 
  Common Stock  
  All of our outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable.    Subject to the prior rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock which later may be issued and outstanding, holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by us out of legally available funds.  In the event of any such declaration or payment, the holders of common stock will be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the preferred stock, to share therein.  If we liquidate, dissolve, or wind up, after distribution and payment in full is made to holders of preferred stock, if any, the remainder of assets, if any, will be distributed pro rata among the holders of common stock of the company.  Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters presented to a vote of shareholders, including the election of directors.  Holders of common stock have no cumulative voting rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any stock or other securities and there are no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions for the common stock.  We may issue additional shares of authorized common stock without shareholder approval, subject to applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange.   
  Computershare, Inc. is the registrar and transfer agent for our common stock. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol  EMR.  
  Preferred Stock  
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation vest our board of directors with authority to issue up to 5,400,000 shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and by resolution or resolutions: 
             
    To fix the distinctive serial designation of the shares of any such series; 

To fix the rate or amount per annum at which the holders of the shares of any series shall be entitled to receive dividends, the dates on which such dividends shall be payable, and the date or dates from which such dividends shall be cumulative; 

To fix the price or prices at which, the times during which, and the other terms upon which the shares of any such series may be redeemed; 

To fix the amounts payable on the shares of any series in the event of dissolution or liquidation of the Company; 

From time to time to include additional shares of preferred stock which the Company is authorized to issue in any such series; 

To determine whether or not the shares of any such series shall be made convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the common stock of the Company, shares of any other series of the preferred stock of the Company, now or hereafter authorized, or any new class of preferred stock of the Company hereafter authorized, or debt securities, the conversion price or prices, or the rate or rates of exchange at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and the terms and conditions upon which any such conversion right shall be exercised; 

To fix such other preferences and rights, privileges and restrictions applicable to any such series as may be permitted by law;  

To determine if a sinking fund shall be provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of any series and, if so, to fix the terms and amount or amounts of such sinking fund; and 

To set the consideration for which the shares of the series are to be issued. 
       
  The shares of different series may differ, including as to ranking.  We may from time to time amend our Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of preferred stock.  The material terms of any series of preferred stock being offered by us will be described in a certificate of amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation or board resolution which will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri and with the SEC, as required.  Such terms may differ from those that are set forth below. 
  Dividend Rights  .  The preferred stock will be preferred as to payment of dividends over our common stock or any other stock ranking junior to the preferred stock as to dividends.  No dividend may be declared or paid and no distribution may be made on our common stock or stock of junior rank, other than dividends or distributions payable in common stock, until the full cumulative dividends on the preferred stock of all series up to the end of the then quarterly dividend period shall have been declared and paid (or appropriated and set aside) by the board of directors.  We will pay those dividends either in cash, shares of common stock or preferred stock or otherwise, at the rate and on the date or dates determined by our board of directors. With respect to each series of preferred stock, the dividends on each share of that series will be cumulative from the date of issue of the share unless some other date is determined by our board of directors.  Accruals of dividends will not bear interest.  If the amount determined by our board of directors to be declared and payable as dividends on the preferred stock is insufficient to pay the full dividend, including accumulations, on all outstanding series, such amount shall be paid on all outstanding shares of all series on pro rata basis generally based on the amount of the full dividend for that series.   
  Rights upon Liquidation  .  The preferred stock will be preferred over common stock, or any other stock ranking junior to the preferred stock with respect to distribution earnings and assets, so that the holders of each series of preferred stock will be entitled to be paid, upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up and before any distribution is made to the holders of common stock or stock of junior rank, the amount as determined by our board of directors.  However, in this case the holders of preferred stock will not be entitled to any other or further payment.  In addition, the rights of the preferred stock in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up shall not restrict or prevent the Company from paying dividends on common stock if the payment of such dividends is not restricted by any other terms of the preferred stock.  If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up amounts available for payment are insufficient to permit the payment in full of the respective amounts to which the holders of all outstanding preferred stock are entitled, the amount available will be distributed among the holders of each series of preferred stock in an amount proportional to the full amounts to which the holders of each series are entitled. 
  Redemption  .  All shares of any series of preferred stock may be redeemable to the extent determined by our board of directors.   
  Conversion or Exchange  .  Shares of any series of preferred stock will be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock or preferred stock or debt securities to the extent determined by our board of directors.   
  Preemptive Rights  .  No holder of shares of any series of preferred stock will have any preemptive or preferential rights to subscribe to or purchase shares of any class or series of stock, now or hereafter authorized, or any securities convertible into, or warrants or other evidences of optional rights to purchase or subscribe to, shares of any series, now or hereafter authorized.  
  Voting Rights  .  Except as determined by our board of directors, the holders of preferred stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of preferred stock held by them on all matters properly presented to shareholders.  The  

holders of common stock and the holders of all series of preferred stock will vote together as one class, except as otherwise provided by law and except as set forth below.   
  The preferences, priorities, special rights and powers given to the preferred stock under our Restated Articles of Incorporation, or to any series thereof by any authorizing action of our board, may be altered or terminated, as provided by law, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of each series of preferred stock issued and outstanding whose rights will be affected by such proposed alteration or termination.  No additional shares of the preferred stock except the shares provided for in our Restated Articles of Incorporation shall be authorized, and no additional shares of any other class of preferred stock having a priority over, or entitled to participate on a parity with, the preferred stock shall be authorized, except upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of each series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding; provided, however, that the authorizing resolution for any series of preferred stock may provide for the vote of a greater percentage of the shares. 
  Currently under Missouri law, even if shares of a particular class or series of stock are not otherwise entitled to a vote on any matter submitted to the shareholders, amendments to the Restated Articles of Incorporation which adversely affect those shares require a vote of the class or series of which such shares are a part, including amendments which would:  
             
    increase or decrease the aggregate number or par value of authorized shares of the class or series; 

create a new class of shares having rights and preferences prior or superior to the shares of the class or series; 

increase the rights and preferences, or the number of authorized shares, of any class having rights and preferences prior to or superior to the rights of the class or series; or 

alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of such class or series so as to affect such shares adversely. 
       
  Board Representation  .  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that in addition to the voting rights set forth above, if, and whenever, six (6) or more quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock shall be in arrears, in whole or in part, the holders of the preferred stock, including all series thereof, voting as a single class, shall have the right to elect a number of the members of the board of directors equal to the whole number obtained by dividing seven (7), into the number of directors of the Company authorized at such time by the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, but not less than two (2) directors.  In such event, the remainder of the directors shall be elected by the holders of the common stock and preferred stock, voting as a single class.  Whenever all dividends in arrears and current dividends on the preferred stock then outstanding have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside, then the right of the holders of the preferred stock to elect such number of directors shall cease.  During the time when the preferred stock is vested with the power of board representation, the secretary of the Company may (and shall upon the written request of the holders of record of ten percent (10%) or more in number of shares of the preferred stock outstanding) call a special meeting of the holders of the preferred stock for the election of the directors to be elected by them subject to the provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation.  In the case of additional authorized shares of preferred stock or a different class of preferred stock shall be created and issued, nothing herein contained shall prevent any such additional shares or class of the preferred stock from having the same voting rights on a pari passu basis with the shares of preferred stock entitled to vote on any matters.   
  Many of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, and thus our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any series of preferred stock is dependent on their financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and other related factors. 
  Depending upon the rights of holders of the preferred stock, an issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock by delaying or preventing a change of control of Emerson, making removal of the management of Emerson difficult, or restricting the payment of dividends and other distributions to the holders of common stock.   
  Certain Effects of Authorized but Unissued Stock  
  We may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval, subject to applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange, for a variety of corporate  

purposes, including raising additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans.  The existence of unissued and unreserved common and preferred stock may enable us to issue shares to persons who are friendly to current management, which could discourage an attempt to obtain control of Emerson through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or otherwise, and protect the continuity of management and possibly deprive you of opportunities to sell your shares at prices higher than the prevailing market prices.  We could also use additional shares to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of Emerson.  See also  Certain Charter and Bylaw Provisions  below.

  Our board previously authorized the issuance of 1,200,000 shares of preferred stock as Series B junior participating preferred stock in connection with our adoption of a shareholder rights plan as of November 1, 1998, which expired by its terms on November 1, 2008.  We do not have any current plans to utilize such preferred stock.  At the time of its authorization, our board designated the dividend, liquidation, voting and redemption features and the rights in the event of a merger of the Series B junior participating preferred stock so that the value of one one-thousandth (1/1,000th) of a share of Series B junior participating preferred stock approximated the value of one share of common stock.  Each of these shares, if issued, would generally be non-redeemable and junior to all other series of preferred stock, have a variable preferential cumulative quarterly dividend, entitle its holder to receive a variable preferred liquidation payment and have one vote. 
  Certain Charter and Bylaw Provisions 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws:  
             
    provide for a classified board of directors; 

limit the right of shareholders to remove directors or change the size of the board of directors; 

limit the right of shareholders to fill vacancies on the board of directors; 

limit the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders or propose other actions; 

require a higher percentage of shareholders than would otherwise be required to amend, alter, change, or repeal certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation; and 

provide that the Bylaws may be amended only by the majority vote of the board of directors. 
       
  Shareholders will not be able to amend the Bylaws without first amending the Restated Articles of Incorporation.  These provisions may discourage certain types of transactions that involve an actual or threatened change of control of Emerson.  
  Size of Board 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that the number of directors will be fixed by our Bylaws; provided that the Bylaws must provide for three or more directors.  Our Bylaws provide for a board of directors of at least three directors and permit the board of directors to set the number of directors from time to time.  In accordance with our Bylaws, our board of directors has fixed the number of directors at ten.  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws further provide that our Bylaws may be amended only by majority vote of our entire board of directors.   
  Election of Directors 
  Our Bylaws provide certain detailed timing and information requirements for the nomination of directors by shareholders.  Descriptions of these requirements are contained in our Proxy Statement.  Our Bylaws do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors.  Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of common stock can elect all the directors of the class then being elected at that meeting of shareholders.  

Classified Board 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that our board will be divided into three classes, with the classes to be as nearly equal in number as possible, and that one class shall be elected each year and serve for a three-year term.  
  Removal of Directors 
  Missouri law provides that, unless a corporation s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the holders of a majority of the corporation s voting stock may remove any director from office.  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that shareholders may remove a director with or without  cause  and with the approval of the holders of 85% of Emerson s voting stock.  Our board of directors may remove a director, with or without cause, only in the event the director fails to meet the qualifications stated in the Bylaws for election as a director or in the event the director is in breach of any agreement between such director and Emerson relating to such director s service as a director or employee of Emerson. 
  Filling Vacancies 
  Missouri law further provides that, unless a corporation s articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, all vacancies on a corporation s board of directors, including any vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors even if that number is less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, until the next election of directors by the shareholders of the corporation.  Our Bylaws provide that, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any class of preferred stock then outstanding and except as described below, only the vote of a majority of the remaining directors may fill vacancies.   
  Limitations on Shareholder Action by Written Consent 
  Missouri law provides that any action by written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting must be unanimous.   
  Limitations on Calling Shareholder Meetings 
  Under our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, special meetings of shareholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, our chairman of the board, or the holders of not less than 85% of our voting stock. 
  Limitations on Introducing Other Items of Business 
  Our Bylaws provide certain detailed timing and information requirements for the introduction of business by shareholders at meetings.  Descriptions of these requirements are contained in our Proxy Statement.     
  Amendment of Restated Articles of Incorporation 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment; provided that certain provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation respecting business combinations, the board of directors, removal of directors, amendment of Bylaws and special meetings of shareholders may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of 85% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of Emerson, voting as a single class. However, the provisions respecting business combinations may be amended upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of Emerson if such amendment shall first have been approved and recommended by a majority of those directors who meet certain criteria of independence from parties seeking a business combination.    
  Business Combination Provisions in Restated Articles of Incorporation 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that certain business combinations involving Emerson and certain 10% shareholders, each as defined in our Restated Articles of Incorporation, require the affirmative vote of the holders of 85% of the outstanding shares of Emerson common stock unless (i) a majority of the continuing directors (as defined in our Restated Articles of Incorporation) have approved the proposed business combination, or (ii) various conditions intended to ensure the adequacy of the consideration offered by the party seeking the combination are satisfied.  Under Missouri law, for certain other mergers, the shareholder approval requirement  

may be two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. However, additional requirements may apply as described in  Missouri Statutory Provisions  herein. 
  Limitation on Directors  Liability 
  Our Restated Articles of Incorporation limit the liability of our directors to us or any of our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted under the Missouri General and Business Corporation Law.   
  Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions 
  The classification of directors, the inability to vote shares cumulatively, the advance notice requirements for nominations, and the provisions in our Restated Articles of Incorporation and/or Bylaws that limit the ability of shareholders to increase the size of our board or to remove directors and that permit the remaining directors to fill any vacancies on our board make it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board.  As a result, at least two annual meetings of shareholders may be required for the shareholders to change a majority of the directors, whether or not a change in our board would benefit Emerson and its shareholders and whether or not a majority of our shareholders believes that the change would be desirable.   
  The provision of Missouri law which requires unanimity for shareholder action by written consent gives all our shareholders entitled to vote on a proposed action the opportunity to participate in the action and prevents the holders of a majority of the voting power of Emerson from using the written consent procedure to take shareholder action.  The Bylaw provision requiring advance notice of other items of business may make it more difficult for shareholders to take action opposed by the board of directors.  Moreover, a shareholder cannot force a shareholder consideration of an item of business over the opposition of our board of directors by calling a special meeting of shareholders.   
  These provisions make it more difficult and time-consuming to obtain majority control of our board of directors or otherwise bring a matter before shareholders without our board s consent, and thus reduce the vulnerability of Emerson to an unsolicited takeover proposal.  These provisions enable Emerson to develop its business in a manner which will foster its long-term growth, by reducing to the extent practicable the threat of a takeover not in the best interests of Emerson and its shareholders and the potential disruption entailed by the threat.  On the other hand, these provisions may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to influence the governance of Emerson and the possibility that shareholders would receive a premium above market price for their securities from a potential acquirer who is unfriendly to management.  The provisions requiring an 85% vote of shareholders for amendments to certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation and for certain business combinations have the effect of limiting the ability of shareholders and others to change the terms of Emerson s Restated Articles of Incorporation and to change control of Emerson.   
  Exclusive Forum Provision 
  Our Bylaws provide for the designation of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, the Circuit Court located in the County of St. Louis, Missouri or other courts in the State of Missouri, as the exclusive forum for certain shareholder litigation such as derivative claims, breach of fiduciary duty claims, claims pursuant to the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, our Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws, claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine and actions to interpret, enforce or determine the validity of our Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws, unless we otherwise consent to another jurisdiction.  
  Missouri Statutory Provisions  
  Missouri law also contains certain provisions which may have an anti-takeover effect and otherwise discourage third parties from effecting transactions with us, including control share acquisition and business combination statutes.  These provisions are referenced or summarized below.  You should not rely on these references or summaries, but rely instead on the actual text of the applicable Missouri law provisions, any applicable Missouri regulations, as well as any case law interpreting such provisions or regulations. 
  Business Combination Statute 
  Missouri law contains a  business combination statute  which restricts certain  business combinations  between us and an  interested shareholder,  or affiliates of the interested shareholder, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the  

interested shareholder s acquisition of stock is approved by our board on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status.   
  The statute also prohibits business combinations after the five-year period following the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder unless the business combination or purchase of stock prior to becoming an interested shareholder is approved by our board prior to the date the interested shareholder obtains such status.  The statute provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless:  
             
    the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, approve the business combination; or 

the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements. 
       
  A  business combination  for this purpose includes a merger or consolidation, some sales, leases, exchanges, pledges and similar dispositions of corporate assets or stock and any reclassifications or recapitalizations that increase the proportionate voting power of the interested shareholder.  An  interested shareholder  for this purpose generally means any person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or controls 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation s voting stock.   
  A Missouri corporation may opt out of coverage by the business combination statute by including a provision to that effect in its governing corporate documents.  We have not done so.   
  The business combination statute may make it more difficult for a 20% beneficial owner to effect other transactions with us and may encourage persons that seek to acquire us to negotiate with our board prior to acquiring a 20% interest.  It is possible that such a provision could make it more difficult to accomplish a transaction which shareholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interest.   
  Control Share Acquisition Statute 
  Missouri also has a  control share acquisition statute.  This statute may limit the rights of a shareholder to vote some or all of his shares.  A shareholder whose acquisition of shares results in that shareholder having voting power, when added to the shares previously held by him, to exercise or direct the exercise of more than a specified percentage of our outstanding stock (beginning at 20%), will lose the right to vote some or all of his shares in excess of such percentage unless the shareholders approve the acquisition of such shares.   
  In order for the shareholders to grant approval, the acquiring shareholder must meet certain disclosure requirements specified in the statute.  In addition, a majority of the outstanding voting shares, as determined before the acquisition, must approve the acquisition.  Furthermore, a majority of the outstanding voting shares, as determined after the acquisition, but excluding shares held by (i) the acquiring shareholder, (ii) employee directors or (iii) officers appointed by the board of directors, must approve the acquisition.  If the acquisition is approved, the statute grants certain rights to dissenting shareholders.   
  Not all acquisitions of shares constitute control share acquisitions.  A variety of ordinary acquisitions of shares and certain other specified acquisitions generally do not constitute control share acquisitions under Missouri law. 
  A Missouri corporation may opt out of coverage by the control share acquisition statute by including a provision to that effect in its governing corporate documents.  We have not opted out of the control share acquisition statute.   
  Take-Over Bid Disclosure Statute 
  Missouri s  take-over bid disclosure statute  requires that, under some circumstances, including inapplicability of disclosure required by the Exchange Act, before making a tender offer that would result in the offeror acquiring control of us, the offeror must file certain disclosure materials with the Commissioner of the Missouri Department of Securities.
