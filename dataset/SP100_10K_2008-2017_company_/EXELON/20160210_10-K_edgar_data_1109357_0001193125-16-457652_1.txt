    PART I          

ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS                  General              Corporate Structure and Business and Other Information             Exelon, incorporated in Pennsylvania in February 1999, is a utility services holding company engaged, through Generation, in the energy generation and power marketing business, and through ComEd, PECO and BGE, in
the energy delivery businesses discussed below. Exelon s principal executive offices are located at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, and its telephone number is 800-483-3220.   
         Generation    
        Generation s integrated business consists of the generation,
physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation also sells renewable energy
and other energy-related products and services, and engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production activities (Upstream). Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and
Other Power Regions.            Generation was formed in 2000 as a
Pennsylvania limited liability company. Generation began operations as a result of a corporate restructuring, effective January 1, 2001, in which Exelon separated its generation and other competitive businesses from its regulated energy
delivery businesses at ComEd and PECO.            Generation s
principal executive offices are located at 300 Exelon Way, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania 19348, and its telephone number is 610-765-5959.         
   ComEd          
  ComEd s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity
transmission and distribution services to retail customers in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.         
  ComEd was organized in the State of Illinois in 1913 as a result of the merger of Cosmopolitan Electric Company into the original corporation named
Commonwealth Edison Company, which was incorporated in 1907. ComEd s principal executive offices are located at 440 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60605, and its telephone number is 312-394-4321.   
         PECO             PECO s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision
of electricity transmission and distribution services to retail customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas
distribution services to retail customers in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.         
  PECO was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. PECO s principal executive offices are located at 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
19103, and its telephone number is 215-841-4000.   
         6   

Table of Contents  

    BGE          
  BGE s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity transmission
and distribution services to retail customers in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services to retail customers in
central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.            BGE was
incorporated in Maryland in 1906. BGE s principal executive offices are located at 110 West Fayette Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, and its telephone number is 410-234-5000.             Operating Segments          
  See Note 25 Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Exelon s
operating segments.             Pending Merger with Pepco Holdings,
Inc.             On April 29, 2014, Exelon and PHI signed an
agreement and plan of merger (as subsequently amended and restated as of July 18, 2014) to combine the two companies in an all cash transaction. The resulting company will retain the Exelon name and be headquartered in Chicago. The merger is
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the pending transaction.   
           Generation    
        Generation, one of the largest competitive electric generation
companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas,
including renewable energy, to both wholesale and retail customers. The retail sales include commercial, industrial and residential customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and
retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generation s fleet,
including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provides geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the challenging conditions emanating from competitive energy markets.
Generation s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation s customer facing
activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation also engages in natural gas and oil exploration and production activities (Upstream).   
        Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is
subject to FERC s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for
sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities and set cost-based rates should
FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional
facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate
  
         7   

Table of Contents  

reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Additionally, ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar
function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state
environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of FERC.         
  RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. PJM, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP, have
been approved by FERC as RTOs, and CAISO and ISO-NY have been approved as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability,
market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service
across several transmission systems.              Constellation Energy Nuclear
Group, Inc.              Generation owns a 50.01% interest in
CENG, a joint venture with EDF. CENG is governed by a board of ten directors, five of which are appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG owns a total of five nuclear generating facilities on three sites, Calvert Cliffs, R.E. Ginna and Nine Mile
Point. CENG s ownership share in the total capacity of these units is 4,007 MW. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information on these sites.         
  Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on
January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. In
addition, under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months.         
  Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. The transfer of the
nuclear operating licenses and the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDF s noncontrolling interest in CENG at fair
value on a fully consolidated basis in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5  Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information regarding the integration transaction.         
    Significant Acquisitions           
    Integrys Energy Services, Inc.   On November 1, 2014, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business
activities of Integrys Energy Group, Inc. through the purchase of all of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (Integrys) for a purchase price of $332 million, including net working capital. The generation and
solar asset businesses of Integrys were excluded from the transaction. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the above acquisition.
             Merger with Constellation Energy Group, Inc.
  On March 12, 2012, Constellation merged into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Since the merger transaction, Generation includes the
former Constellation generation and customer supply operations.

     Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One.   On September 30, 2011, Exelon completed the
acquisition of all of the interests in Antelope Valley, a 242-MW solar project under development in northern Los Angeles County, California, from First Solar, Inc. The facility became fully operational in 2014. The project has a 25-year PPA with
Pacific Gas   Electric Company for the full output of the plant, which has been approved by the CPUC. Total capitalized costs for the facility incurred through completion of the project were approximately $1.1 billion.   
          Wolf Hollow Generating Station.   On August 24, 2011,
Generation completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Wolf Hollow, LLC (Wolf Hollow), a combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plant in north Texas, for a purchase price of $311 million which increased Generation s owned
capacity within the ERCOT power market by 704 MWs.              Significant
Dispositions                Asset Divestitures.   As
of December 31, 2015, Generation has sold certain generating assets with total pre-tax proceeds of $1.8 billion (after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion). The proceeds are expected to be used primarily to finance a portion of the
acquisition of PHI.              Maryland Clean Coal
Stations.   On November 30, 2012, a subsidiary of Generation sold the Brandon Shores generating station and H.A. Wagner generating station in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the C.P. Crane generating station in Baltimore County,
Maryland to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Riverstone Holdings LLC to comply with certain of the regulatory approvals required by the merger with Constellation Energy Group, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $371 million, which
resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $272 million.         
  See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated

Table of Contents  

Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee; and the United
States footprint of MISO (excluding MISO s Southern Region), which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not covered by PJM; and
parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky (approximately 37% of capacity).            

New England represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont
(approximately 7% of capacity).            

New York represents the operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety (approximately 3% of capacity).

ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas (approximately 11% of capacity).

Other Power Regions is an aggregate of regions not considered individually significant (approximately 6% of capacity).      
        See Note 25 Segment Information of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on revenues from external customers and revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for each of Generation s reportable segments.   
          Nuclear Facilities     
        Generation has ownership interests in fourteen nuclear generating
stations currently in service, consisting of 24 units with an aggregate of 19,460 MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75% ownership), Peach Bottom Generating
Station (50% ownership), and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated on Exelon s and Generation s financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit. In addition,
Generation owns a 50.01% interest, collectively, in the CENG generating stations (Calvert Cliffs, Nine Mile Point [excluding LIPA s 18% ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2] and R.E. Ginna) which are 100% consolidated on Exelon and
Generation s financial statements as of April 1, 2014. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        Generation s nuclear generating stations are all operated by
Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2015, 2014 and 2013 electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating
facilities was 68%, 67% and 57%, respectively, of Generation s total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. The majority of this output was dispatched to
support Generation s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of Generation s electric supply
sources.              Nuclear Operations.   Capacity
factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States,
Generation can negotiate favorable terms for the materials and services that its business requires. Generation s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history.
  
         10   

Table of Contents  

   During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation achieved capacity
factors of 93.7%, 94.3% and 94.1%, respectively. The capacity factors reflect ownership percentage of stations operated by Generation and include CENG as of April 1, 2014. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their
duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generation s wholesale and retail marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance
and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations.         
  In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating
and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.
             Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation.  
Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and
regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance
indicators and inspection results, and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of January 6, 2016, the NRC categorized Clinton and Dresden unit 2 in the Regulatory Response Column, which is the second highest of five performance
bands. All other units operated by Generation are categorized in the Licensee Response Column as of December 31, 2015, which is the highest performance band. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties
for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities
and/or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units.         
  On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi events issued a report of its review of the accident, including recommendations for future
regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The Task Force s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and
its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. For additional information on the NRC actions related
to the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the industry s response, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview.

     Licenses   .  Generation has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its
nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3, Dresden Units 2 and 3, Quad Cities Units 1 and 2, Oyster Creek Unit 1, Calvert Cliffs Units 1 and 2, Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2, R.E. Ginna Unit 1,
Three Mile Island Unit 1, Limerick Units 1 and 2, Byron Units 1 and 2 and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. Additionally, PSEG has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. On
December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for Generation s
nuclear facilities in service:         

(a)  
  Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.     

(b)  
  In December 2014, Generation submitted applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of LaSalle Units 1 and 2 by 20 years.     

(c)  
  Stations for which the NRC has issued renewed operating licenses.     

(d)  
  Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has advised the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed
until the first quarter of 2021.     

(e)  
  In December 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.     
        Generation currently has a license renewal application pending for
LaSalle Units 1 and 2. Generation has advised the NRC that any license renewal application for Clinton would not be filed until the first quarter of 2021. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the
commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review. The NRC review process takes approximately two years from the docketing of an application. Each requested license renewal is expected to be for 20 years beyond the
original operating license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the actual and assumed renewal of operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating
stations except for Oyster Creek.

Table of Contents  

   In August 2012, Generation entered into an operating services agreement with the Omaha Public Power
District (OPPD) to provide operational and managerial support services for the Fort Calhoun Station and a licensing agreement for use of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model. The terms for both agreements are 20 years. OPPD will continue to own the
plant and remain the NRC licensee.              Nuclear Uprate
Program.   Generation is engaged in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear fleet. When economically viable, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and
application of expertise gained from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Once all projects are completed in 2016, Generation will have placed in-service 538 MWs of new nuclear generation.   
        As of December 31, 2015, under the nuclear uprate program,
Generation has placed into service projects representing 536 MWs of new nuclear generation at a cost of $1,436 million, which has been capitalized to property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
             Nuclear Waste Storage and Disposal.   There are
no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site
storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support
operations.            As of December 31, 2015, Generation had
approximately 75,800 SNF assemblies (18,800 tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station
has been assumed by another party; see Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). All currently operating Generation-owned
nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage, except for Clinton and Three Mile Island, in which on-site dry cask storage will be in operation at Clinton in 2016 and is projected to be in operation at Three Mile Island in 2023. On-site dry cask
storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning.   
        For a discussion of matters associated with Generation s contracts
with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
  As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed
of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated
within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020.   
        Generation ships its Class A LLRW, which represents 93% of LLRW
generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Oyster Creek and Salem), and
Connecticut.            Generation utilizes on-site storage capacity
at all its stations to stage for shipping campaigns and store, as needed, Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B   
         13   

Table of Contents  

and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C
LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generation s nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be
required to utilize on-site storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation s nuclear fleet. Generation continues
to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize cost impacts and on-site storage.         
    Nuclear Insurance.   Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its
nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See  Nuclear Insurance  within Note 23 Commitments and
Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.            For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the
policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition and results of operations.   
          Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees
of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Note 3 Regulatory Matters, Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 16 Asset Retirement
Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation s NDT funds and its decommissioning obligations.   
         Zion Station Decommissioning.  On December 11, 2007,
Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for
decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998.            On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land)
associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF,
associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is
subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. See Note
16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning and see Note 2 Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of variable interest entity considerations related to ZionSolutions.

     Fossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric)     
        Generation has ownership interests in 13,281 MW of capacity in fossil
and renewable generating facilities currently in service. Generation wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) jointly owned facilities that include Wyman; (2) an ownership interest through
an equity method investment in Sunnyside; (3) certain wind project entities with minority interest owners; and (4) an ownership interest in the Albany Green Energy, LLC project entity, see Note 2  Variable Interest Entities of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these wind project entities. Generation s fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of LaPorte, Sunnyside and
Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 8%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of Generation s total electric supply. The majority
of this output was dispatched to support Generation s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generation s electric generating facilities, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Exelon Generation
Company, LLC and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview for additional information on Generation Renewable Development.   
          Licenses.   Fossil and renewable generation plants are
generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or
connected to the interstate electric grid. On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for 46-year licenses for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy
Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run), respectively. On December 22, 2015, FERC issued a new 40-year license for Muddy Run. The license term expires on December 1, 2055. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing
process was not completed prior to the expiration of Conowingo s license on September 1, 2014. FERC is required to issue an annual license for a facility until the new license is issued. On September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual
license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a new license prior to the expiration of annual license, the annual license will renew automatically. The stations are currently being depreciated
over their estimated useful lives, which includes the license renewal period. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
          Insurance.   Generation maintains business interruption
insurance for its renewable and fossil projects, and delay in start-up insurance for its renewable and fossil projects currently under construction. Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance for its wholly owned fossil and
hydroelectric operations, unless required by financing agreements; see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing agreements. Generation maintains both
property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses
could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Exelon Generation Company,
LLC.

     Long-Term Power Purchase Contracts     
        In addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation
sources electricity and other related output from plants it does not own under long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original term in excess of one
year in duration, by region, in effect as of December 31, 2015:         
       
            Fuel     
        The following table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for 2015
and 2014:         

(a)  
  Includes the proportionate share of output where Generation has an undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned generating plants and includes the total output of plants that
are fully consolidated (e.g., CENG). Nuclear generation for 2015 and 2014 includes physical volumes of 33,415 GWh and 25,053 GWh, respectively, for CENG.     

(c)  
  Includes hydroelectric, wind, and solar generating assets.           
  The fuel costs per MWh for nuclear generation are less than those for fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most
cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale and retail load servicing requirements.            The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of
the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through 2018. Generation s contracted conversion
services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2018. All of Generation s enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2020. Contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2022. Generation
does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units.   
         16   

Table of Contents  

   Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases.
Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing.   
        Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated
with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price risk, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial
instruments.              Power Marketing     
        Generation s integrated business operations include the physical
delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership of generation assets and power purchase
and lease agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs, including tolling agreements, are commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are
dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership depending on the type of underlying asset. Generation secures contracted generation as part of its overall strategic plan, with objectives such as obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its
physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers and assisting customers to meet renewable portfolio standards. Generation may also buy power in the market to meet the energy demand of its customers. Generation sells electricity,
natural gas, and related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation s
customer facing operations combine a unified sales force with a customer-centric model that leverages technology to broaden the range of products and solutions offered, which Generation believes promotes stronger customer relationships. This model
focuses on efficiency and cost reduction, which provides a platform that is scalable and able to capitalize on opportunities for future growth.         
  Generation may purchase more than the energy demanded by its customers. Generation then sells this open position, along with capacity not used to
meet customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs in
markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions, including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of warmer-than-normal weather
conditions. Additionally, Generation is involved in the development, exploration, and harvesting of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties (Upstream).   
          Price Supply Risk Management     
        Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel
associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into transactions that are
outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk in 2016 and beyond for portions of its electricity portfolio that are unhedged. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to
mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 90%-93%, 60%-63% and 28%-31% for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected
generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation.   
         17   

Table of Contents  

Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes
assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative
contracts, including sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load. A portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which
routinely change in the market. The corporate risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary
trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation s efforts. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop-loss
and value-at-risk limits, to manage exposure to market risk. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information.   
        At December 31, 2015, Generation s short and long-term
commitments relating to the purchase of energy and capacity from and to unaffiliated utilities and others were as follows:         

(a)  
  Net capacity purchases include PPAs and other capacity contracts including those that are accounted for as operating leases. Amounts presented in the commitments represent
Generation s expected payments under these arrangements at December 31, 2015, net of fixed capacity payments expected to be received ( Capacity offsets ) by Generation under contracts to resell such acquired capacity to third
parties under long-term capacity sale contracts. As of December 31, 2015, capacity offsets were $146 million, $149 million, $150 million, $151 million, $142 million, and $462 million for years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and thereafter,
respectively. Expected payments include certain fixed capacity charges which may be reduced based on plant availability.     

(b)  
  The table excludes renewable energy purchases that are contingent in nature.     

(c)  
  Transmission rights purchases include estimated commitments for additional transmission rights that will be required to fulfill firm sales contracts.     
          Capital Expenditures     
        Generation s business is capital intensive and requires
significant investments in nuclear fuel and energy generation assets and in other internal infrastructure projects. Generation s estimated capital expenditures for 2016 are as follows:         

(a)  
  Includes Generation s share of the investment in nuclear fuel for the co-owned Salem plant.     

(b)  
  Includes the CENG units on a fully consolidated basis.

  PECO has the necessary authorizations to provide regulated electric and natural gas distribution services in the various municipalities or
territories in which it now supplies such services. PECO s authorizations consist of charter rights and certificates of public convenience issued by the PAPUC and/or  grandfathered rights,  with all of such rights generally unlimited
as to time and generally exclusive from competition from other electric and natural gas utilities. In a few defined municipalities, PECO s natural gas service territory authorizations overlap with that of another natural gas utility; however,
PECO does not consider those situations as posing a material competitive or financial threat.               BGE             BGE is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity distribution and transmission services to retail customers in central Maryland, including the
City of Baltimore, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of gas distribution services to retail customers in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore. BGE is a public utility under the Public
Utilities Article of the Maryland Annotated Code subject to regulation by the MDPSC related to electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuances of certain securities and certain other aspects of BGE s business. BGE is a public
utility under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to transmission rates and certain other aspects of BGE s business and by the U.S. Department of Transportation related to pipeline safety and other areas of gas
operations. Specific operations of BGE are subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, BGE is also subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards.

   BGE has the necessary authorizations to provide regulated electric and natural gas distribution
services in the various municipalities and territories in which it now supplies such services. With respect to electric distribution service, BGE s authorizations consist of charter rights, a state-wide franchise grant and a franchise grant
from the City of Baltimore. The franchise rights are nonexclusive and are perpetual. With respect to natural gas distribution service, BGE s authorizations consist of charter rights, a perpetual state-wide franchise grant and franchises granted
by all the municipalities and/or governmental bodies in which BGE now supplies services. The franchise grants are not exclusive; some are perpetual and some are for a limited duration, which BGE anticipates being able to extend or replace prior to
expiration.               ComEd, PECO and BGE
              Utility Operations     
         Service Territories.  The following table presents the size of
retail service territories, populations of each retail service territory and the number of retail customers within each retail service territory for ComEd, PECO and BGE as of December 31, 2015:   

(a)  
  Includes approximately 2.8 million in the city of Chicago.     

(b)  
  Includes approximately 1.6 million in the city of Philadelphia.     

(c)  
  Includes approximately 0.6 million in the city of Baltimore.           
   Peak Deliveries.  ComEd, PECO and BGE electric sales and peak load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature
extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO and BGE, natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating.   
        The following table summarizes peak deliveries for ComEd, PECO and BGE
for electric and gas deliveries during peak demand months as of December 31, 2015:         
           Electric and Natural Gas
Distribution Services.  ComEd, PECO and BGE are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject
to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. PECO s and BGE s electric and gas
distribution costs are recovered through traditional rate case proceedings. In certain instances, ComEd, PECO and BGE use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by the ICC, PAPUC, and MDPSC, respectively.   
         20   

Table of Contents  

   Through the ICC, ComEd is obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service
territories and also retain significant default service obligations (referred to as POLR) to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. Through
the PAPUC and MDPSC, PECO and BGE, respectively, are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories and also retain significant default service obligations (referred to as DSP and SOS for
electric and PGC and MBR for natural gas, respectively) to provide electricity or natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier or a competitive natural gas
supplier. ComEd is permitted to recover electric costs, and PECO and BGE are permitted to recover electric and natural gas procurement costs from retail customers. Therefore, fluctuations in electric and natural gas procurement costs have no impact
on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense.            ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO and BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. The
customer s choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenues collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. Customer choice program activity has no impact on electric and gas
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation or natural gas supplier, ComEd, PECO and BGE may act as the billing agent but do not record revenues or purchased power and fuel
expense related to the electric and natural gas procurement costs. ComEd, PECO and BGE remain the distribution service providers for all customers in their respective service territories and charge a regulated rate for distribution service.
           Retail customers participating in customer choice programs,
and retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of GWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for ComEd, PECO and BGE consisted of the following at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

(a)  
  In September 2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and began purchasing its electricity from ComEd. Approximately 670,000
customers were impacted by the City of Chicago s decision which resulted in the reduction in the number of customers participating in customer choice programs in 2015.

    Procurement-Related Proceedings.  ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s electric supply for
its customers is primarily procured through contracts as required by the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, respectively. ComEd, PECO and BGE procure electricity supply from various approved bidders, including Generation. Charges incurred for electric supply
procured through contracts with Generation are included in Purchased power from affiliates on ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.            PECO s and BGE s natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms of up to three years.
PECO and BGE have annual firm supply from transportation contracts of 132,000 mmcf and 128,000 mmcf, respectively. In addition, to supplement gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO and BGE have
available storage capacity from the following sources:         

(a)  
  Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 28% and 31% of PECO and BGE s 2015-2016 heating season planned supplies, respectively.
             PECO and BGE have long-term interstate
pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural
gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO and BGE make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas.             Energy Efficiency Programs.  ComEd, PECO and BGE are also allowed to recover costs associated with energy
efficiency and demand response programs. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards
required by each respective regulatory agency.             Capital
Investment.  ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s businesses are capital intensive and requires significant investments, primarily in electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure
the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2016 are $2,425 million, $675 million and $825 million,
respectively.            ComEd, PECO and BGE each have ICC, PAPUC and
MDPSC, respectively, approved smart meter and smart grid deployment programs to enhance their distribution systems. The following table summarizes ComEd s smart meter and PECO s and BGE s smart meter and smart grid technology spending
and meter installations as of December 31, 2015:         
 
         22

(a)  
  ComEd has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion over a ten year period to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology.
These amounts represent capital expenditures associated with ComEd s commitment.     

(b)  
  PECO will seek recovery of costs associated with PECO s gas AMI through the traditional rate case process.     

(c)  
  BGE is seeking recovery of its smart grid initiative costs as part of its 2015 electric and gas distribution rate case. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.               Transmission Services.  ComEd, PECO and BGE provide unbundled transmission service under rates approved by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage competition for wholesale generation
services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. Under FERC s open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, ComEd, PECO and BGE, as owners of transmission facilities, are
required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. ComEd, PECO and BGE are required to comply with FERC s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public
information between the transmission owner s employees and wholesale merchant employees.            PJM is the ISO and the FERC-approved RTO for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff). PJM
operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. ComEd, PECO and BGE are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service
pursuant to the PJM Tariff. ComEd, PECO, BGE and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM
Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.            ComEd  s  and BGE s transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in
January 2008 and April 2006, respectively. FERC s order establishes the agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an
annual basis.            PECO s customers are charged for
PECO s PJM retail transmission services on a full and current basis through a Transmission Service Charge (applicable to default service only) and through a Non-Bypassable Transmission Charge (applicable to all distribution customers) in
accordance with PECO s approved distribution rates.

           Employees    
        As of December 31, 2015, Exelon and its subsidiaries had 29,762
employees in the following companies, of which 9,649 or 32% were covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs):         
 
         23   

Table of Contents  

(a)  
  A separate CBA between ComEd and IBEW Local 15 covers approximately 61 employees in ComEd s System Services Group and was extended to April 1, 2016. Generation s
and ComEd s separate CBAs with IBEW Local 15 expires in 2019.     

(b)  
  1,327 PECO craft and call center employees in the Philadelphia service territory are covered by CBAs with IBEW Local 614, both expiring in 2021. Additionally, Exelon Power, an
operating unit of Generation, has an agreement with IBEW Local 614, which expires in 2016 and covers 102 employees.     

(d)  
  Other includes shared services employees at BSC.           
     Environmental Regulation          
    General           
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are subject to comprehensive and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal
government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to regulations administered by the EPA and various state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state and
local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal.         
  The Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address
environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as
senior management of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The
Exelon Board of Directors has delegated to its corporate governance committee the authority to oversee Exelon s compliance with laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including
Exelon s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon Board of Directors has also delegated to its Generation Oversight Committee the authority to oversee environmental, health and
safety issues relating to Generation. The respective Boards of ComEd, PECO and BGE, which each include directors who also serve on the Exelon Board of Directors, oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to ComEd, PECO and BGE.
             Air Quality     
        Air quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and the various state
and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such permits have been obtained by Exelon s subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Clean Air Act establishes a comprehensive and complex national
program to substantially reduce air pollution from power plants.            See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information regarding clean air regulation in the forms of the CSAPR, the regulation
of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating facilities under MATS, and regulation of GHG emissions.

     Water Quality           
  Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental
agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Generation s power generation facilities discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and
operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being granted an administrative extension. Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state and regional agencies and compacts, including the
Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.              Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act.   Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse
environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating
systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek,
Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside, Salem and Schuylkill.         
  On October 14, 2014, the EPA s final Section 316(b) rule became effective. The rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be
performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic life, followed by an implementation period for the selected technology. The timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of
its current NPDES permit and the subsequent renewal period. There is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director.   
        Until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable
state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, Generation cannot estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows, and
financial position. Should a state permitting director determine that a facility must install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facility s economic viability would be called into question. However, the potential impact of the rule
has been significantly reduced since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a national standard and sets forth technologies that are presumptively compliant, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and
can take into consideration site-specific factors.         
    New York Facilities  . In July 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued a policy regarding the best
available technology for cooling water intake structures. Through its policy, the DEC established closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent as the performance goal for all existing facilities, but also provided that the DEC will select a feasible
technology whose costs are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained and allows for a site-specific determination where the entrainment performance goal cannot be achieved. The Ginna and Nine Mile Point Unit 1 power
generation facilities received renewals of their state water discharge permits in 2014.              Salem.   In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, expiring in July 2006, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with its existing cooling water system. In February 2006,
PSEG filed a renewal application with the NJDEP allowing Salem to continue operating under its existing NPDES permit until a new permit was issued. On June 30, 2015, NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require
installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. The draft permit was subject to a public notice and comment period and the
NJDEP may make revisions before issuing the final permit expected during the first half of 2016.

     Solid and Hazardous Waste     
        CERCLA provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated
by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons
responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of
waste at sites, most of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning
their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that
contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.   
        Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE and their subsidiaries are, or are
likely to become, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for
which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party.            See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding solid and hazardous waste regulation and legislation.   
          Environmental Remediation     
        ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s environmental liabilities
primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover environmental remediation costs of
the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The amount to be
expended in 2016 at Exelon for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is expected to total $38 million, consisting of $32 million and $6 million respectively, at ComEd
and PECO.            Generation s environmental liabilities
primarily arise from contamination at current and former generation and waste storage facilities. As of December 31, 2015, Generation has established an appropriate liability to comply with environmental remediation requirements including
contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue, and at a disposal facility named West Lake Landfill, both near St. Louis, Missouri related to operations conducted by Cotter
Corporation, a former ComEd subsidiary.            In addition,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs.   
        See Notes 3 Regulatory Matters and 23 Commitments and
Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and

     Global Climate Change     
        Exelon believes the evidence of global climate change is compelling
and that the energy industry, though not alone, is a significant contributor to the human-caused emissions of GHGs that many in the scientific community believe contribute to global climate change, and as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change in their Fifth Assessment Report Summary for Policy Makers issued in September 2013. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly low-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar
photovoltaic), has a relatively small GHG emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment in low-carbon intensity assets, Generation s emission intensity, or
rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon does produce GHG emissions, primarily at its natural gas-fired generating plants; CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are all
emitted in this process, with CO2 representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels represent the majority of Exelon s direct GHG emissions in 2015, although only a small portion of
Exelon s electric supply is from fossil generating plants. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage in its electric transmission and distribution
operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and fossil fuel generation of electricity used to power its facilities. Despite its focus on low-carbon generation,
Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for information regarding the market and financial,
regulatory and legislative, and operational risks associated with climate change.              Climate Change Regulation.   Exelon is, or may become, subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and state levels.   
         International Climate Change Regulation.  At
the international level, the United States is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21   st    session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015. The Paris Agreement defines the
UNFCCC s objective of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. All Parties are required to develop their own national emission reductions and to update those reductions at least every five years. The
Developed Country Parties, including the United States, are required to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. The United States had previously submitted its national emission reductions to achieve a 2020
target of reducing net emissions in the range of 17% below the 2005 level and to achieve net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 26% 28% below the 2005 level by 2025. The United States has indicated that it intends to achieve these reductions
through a variety of mechanisms, including regulations to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. The Paris Agreement will enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which at least 55 Parties accounting for at least an
estimated 55% of total global greenhouse gas emissions have ratified the Agreement.             Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  It is highly uncertain that Federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted. If such legislation is adopted, Exelon may incur costs either to
further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to procure emission allowances or credits. In June 2013, the White House released the President s Climate Action Plan which consists of a wide variety of executive actions
targeting GHG reductions, preparing for the impacts of climate change and showing leadership internationally; but the plan did not directly trigger any new requirements or legislative action.            The EPA is addressing the issue of carbon dioxide
(CO   2   ) emissions regulation for new and existing electric generating units through
the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under   
         27   

Table of Contents  

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to the Climate Action Plan, President Obama directed the EPA to regulate new and modified fossil fired generating units under Section 111(b)
of the Clean Air Act. The EPA finalized the rule in August 2015, and the final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.   
        Under the President s memorandum, the EPA was
also required to finalize a rule to establish CO   2    emission reduction requirements
for existing fossil-fuel generating stations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The final rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, became effective on December 22, 2015. The rule sets GHG emission reduction targets for each state, with
reductions beginning in 2022, and the target achieved by 2030. States must submit an implementation plan to the EPA by September 2016, unless granted an extension of up to two years. States are granted latitude to select from a number of compliance
options, which are designed to achieve the reductions in the most cost-effective manner. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On February 9, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the
Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. While the ultimate impact of the Clean Power Plan rule is
expected to be favorable, Exelon and Generation cannot at this time predict to what extent the states  actions to comply with the Clean Power Plan s emission reduction targets will impact their future financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.             Regional
and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  After a two-year program review, the nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states currently participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiative (RGGI) released an updated RGGI Model
Rule and Program Review Recommendations Summary on February 7, 2013. Under the updated RGGI program the regional RGGI
CO   2    budget was reduced, starting in 2014, from its previous 165 million ton
level to 91 million tons, with a 25 percent reduction in the cap level each year from 2015 through 2020. Included in the program are provisions for cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances, which will become available if the total demand for
allowances, above the CCR trigger price, exceeds the number of CO   2    allowances
available for purchase at auction. (CCR trigger prices are $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016 and $10 in 2017; after 2017 the CCR price increases by 2.5 percent each year). Such an outcome could put modest upward pressure on wholesale power prices; however, the
specifics are currently uncertain.            At the state level, the
Illinois Climate Change Advisory Group, created by Executive Order 2006-11 on October 5, 2006, made its final recommendations on September 6, 2007 to meet the Governor s GHG reduction goals. At this time, the only requirements imposed
by the state of Illinois are the energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards in the Illinois Power Act that apply to ComEd.         
  On December 18, 2009, Pennsylvania issued the state s final Climate Change Action Plan. The plan sets as a target a 30 percent reduction
in GHG emissions by 2020. The Climate Change Advisory Committee continues to meet quarterly to review Climate Action Work Plans for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The Climate Change Action Plan does not impose any requirements
on Generation or PECO at this time.            The Maryland Commission
on Climate Change was chartered in 2007 and released a greenhouse gas reduction strategy with 42 recommendations on August 27, 2008. The plan s primary policy recommendation to formally adopt science-based regulatory goals to reduce
Maryland s GHG emissions was realized with the passage of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of 2009 (GGRA) which requires Maryland to reduce its GHG emissions by 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020. It also directed the Maryland
Department of Environment to prepare and implement an action plan which was published in October of 2013. Maryland s electricity consumption reduction goals, required under the  EmPOWER Maryland  program, and mandatory State
participation in RGGI Program, are listed as the energy sector s contribution in the plan. The plan also advocated raising the renewable portfolio standard requirement from 20% by 2022 to 25% by 2022. The Department of Environment was required
to submit a December 2015 report to the Governor and General Assembly   
         28

economic impacts on manufacturing sector and other information and determine whether to continue, adjust or eliminate the requirement to achieve a 25% reduction by 2020.   
         Exelon s Voluntary Climate Change Efforts . In a world
increasingly concerned about global climate change and regulatory action to reduce GHG, Exelon s low-carbon generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest carbon electric generators
in the United States: nuclear for base load, natural gas for marginal and peak demand, hydro and pumped storage, and supplemental wind and solar renewables. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of GHG and air
pollutants are promulgated, Exelon s low-carbon, low-emission generation fleet will position the company to benefit from its comparative advantage over other generation fleets.              Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards     
        Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form
of RPS requirement. Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland have laws specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the
future by the United States Congress. Also, states that currently do not have RPS requirements may adopt such legislation in the future.         
  Illinois utilities are required to procure cost-effective renewable energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity
that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. ComEd is also required to acquire amounts of renewable energy resources to cumulatively increase this percentage to at least 10% by June 1, 2015 and an ultimate target of at
least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply with the
Illinois legislation. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without mark-up through rates.   
        The AEPS Act became effective for PECO on January 1, 2011. During
2015, PECO was required to supply approximately 5.0% of electric energy generated from Tier I alternative energy resources (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass
energy, coal mine methane and black liquor generated within Pennsylvania), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2015 and subsequently 5.5% beginning June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2016. PECO was also required to supply
6.2% of electric energy generated from Tier II alternative energy resources (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing wood and by-products of the pulping process
and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification technology), as measured in AECs, through May 31, 2015 and subsequently 8.2% beginning June 1, 2015 and continuing through May 31, 2016. The compliance
requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to comply with these requirements, PECO entered into agreements with varying terms with accepted bidders, including Generation, to purchase non-solar
Tier I, solar Tier 1 and Tier II AECs. PECO also purchases AECs through its DSP Program full requirement contracts.         
  Section 7-703 of the Public Utilities Article in Maryland sets forth the RPS requirement, which applies to all retail electricity sales in
Maryland by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, biomass, methane, geothermal, ocean, fuel cell, small hydroelectric, and
poultry litter) and Tier 2   
         29   

Table of Contents  

sources (hydroelectric, other than pump storage generation, and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in 2006, requiring that suppliers procure 1.0% and 2.5% from Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources,
respectively, escalating in 2022 to 22.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.0% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options by 2022. In 2015, 10.5% was required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including at least 0.5% derived
from solar energy and 2.5% from Tier 2 renewable sources. BGE is subject to requirements established by the Public Utilities Article in Maryland related to the use of alternative energy resources; however, the wholesale suppliers that supply power
to BGE through SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with BGE, to meet the RPS requirements.         
  Similar to ComEd, PECO and BGE, Generation s retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in many of the
states in which it does business from renewable resources or approved equivalents such as RECs. Potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources could increase the pace of development of wind and other
renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time, such developments may present some opportunities for
sales of Generation s renewable power, including from wind, solar, hydroelectric and landfill gas.

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS            
  Each of the Registrants operates in a market and regulatory environment that poses significant risks, many of which are beyond that
Registrant s control. Management of each Registrant regularly meets with the Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and the RMC, which comprises officers of the Registrants, to identify and evaluate the most significant risks of the Registrants 
businesses, and the appropriate steps to manage and mitigate those risks. The Chief Enterprise Risk Officer and senior executives of the Registrants discuss those risks with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the Exelon board of
directors and the ComEd, PECO and BGE boards of directors. In addition, the   
         34   

Table of Contents  

generation oversight committee of the Exelon board of directors evaluates risks related to the generation business. The risk factors discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the
Registrants  results of operations or cash flows and the market prices of their publicly traded securities. Each of the Registrants has disclosed the known material risks that affect its business at this time. However, there may be further
risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by a Registrant to be material that could adversely affect its performance or financial condition in the future.   
        Exelon s financial conditions and results of operations are
affected to a significant degree by: (1) Generation s position as a predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy markets with a concentration in select regions, and (2) the role of ComEd, PECO and BGE as
operators of electric transmission and distribution systems in three of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Factors that affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Registrants fall primarily under the following
categories, all of which are discussed in further detail below:         

Market and Financial Factors.   Exelon s and Generation s results of operations are affected by price fluctuations in the energy markets.
Power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects the prices that Generation can obtain for the output of its power
plants, (2) the presence of other generation resources in the markets in which Generation s output is sold, (3) the demand for electricity in the markets where the Registrants conduct their business, and (4) the impacts of
on-going competition in the retail channel.            

Regulatory and Legislative Factors.   The regulatory and legislative factors that affect the Registrants include changes to the laws and regulations
that govern competitive markets and utility cost recovery, and that drive environmental policy. In particular, Exelon s and Generation s financial performance could be affected by changes in the design of competitive wholesale power
markets or Generation s ability to sell power in those markets. In addition, potential regulation and legislation, including legislation or regulation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standards, could have significant effects on
the Registrants. Also, returns for ComEd, PECO and BGE are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceedings.            

Operational Factors.   The Registrants  operational performance is subject to those factors inherent in running the nation s largest fleet
of nuclear power reactors and large electric and gas distribution systems. The safe and effective operation of the nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations as well as the ability to maintain
the availability, reliability and safety of its energy delivery systems are fundamental to Exelon s ability to protect and grow shareholder value. Additionally, the operating costs of ComEd, PECO and BGE, and the opinions of their customers and
regulators, are affected by those companies  ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery systems.            

Risks Related to the Pending Merger with PHI.   There are various risks and uncertainties associated with the merger agreement announced with PHI on
April 29, 2014.               A discussion of each
of these risk categories and other risk factors is included below.         
    Market and Financial Factors           
   Generation is exposed to depressed prices in the wholesale and retail power markets, which could negatively affect its results of operations or cash flows.
(Exelon and Generation)             Generation is exposed to
commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. Generation s earnings and cash flows are therefore subject to variability as spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates rise
and fall.   
         35   

Table of Contents  

    Price of Fuels : The spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by
the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit. Often, the next unit of
electricity will be supplied from generating stations fueled by fossil fuels. Consequently, changes in the market price of fossil fuels often result in comparable changes to the market price of power. For example, the use of new technologies to
recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on power prices. The continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resources, such
as wind and solar, whether mandated through RPS or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation, may displace a higher marginal cost plant, further reducing power prices. In addition, further delay or elimination of
EPA air quality regulations could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market prices.         
   Demand and Supply:  The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of
electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs could each depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as frequently,
putting downward pressure on electricity market prices. The tepid economic environment in recent years and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiatives have limited the demand for electricity in Generation s markets. In addition,
in some markets, the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation, when combined with other base-load generation such as nuclear, could often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating
plants. Increased supply in excess of demand is furthered by the continuation of RPS mandates and subsidies for renewable energy.         
   Retail Competition:  Generation s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that
Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and
wholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output. Increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margins and profitability in Generation s retail operations.
           Sustained low market prices or depressed demand and
over-supply could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations or cash flows, and such impacts could be emphasized given Generation s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two
geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. These impacts could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s ability to fund other discretionary uses of cash such as growth projects or to pay dividends. In addition,
such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s result of operations through accelerated depreciation expense, impairment charges
related to inventory that cannot be used at other nuclear units and cancellation of in-flight capital projects, accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel costs, severance costs, accelerated asset retirement obligation expense relate to
future decommissioning activities, and additional funding of decommissioning costs, which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expenses. A slow recovery in market conditions could result in a prolonged depression of
or further decline in commodity prices, including low forward natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, which could also adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. See
Note 9 Implications of Potential Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         36

    In addition to price fluctuations, Generation is exposed to other risks in the power markets that are beyond its
control and could negatively affect its results of operations. (Exelon and Generation)               Credit Risk.   In the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money, or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform
under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and
incur additional losses, to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs,
the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participants. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition,
Generation s retail sales subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. Retail credit risk results when
customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the
customer.              Market Designs.   The wholesale
markets remain evolving markets that vary from region to region and are still developing rules, practices and procedures. Changes in these market rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect
Generation s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability.   
         The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over
time affect or transform the energy industry, including technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Some of these technologies include, but are not limited to further
shale gas development or sources, cost-effective renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles, distributed generation and energy storage devices. Such developments could affect the price of energy, could affect energy
deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, could require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or
distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants 
results of operations, cash flows or financial positions through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or
accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.             Market performance and other factors could decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant
additional funding. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation s NDTs and
Exelon s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations
and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below the Registrants  projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments could increase Generation s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear
plants. A decline in the   
         37   

Table of Contents  

market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets will increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon s pension and
OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of
retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. If future
increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets or other factors cannot be recovered, or cannot be recovered in a timely manner, from ComEd, PECO and BGE customers, the results of operations and financial
positions of ComEd, PECO and BGE could be negatively affected. Ultimately, if the Registrants are unable to manage the investments within the NDT funds and benefit plan assets, and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liabilities, their
results of operations, cash flows or financial positions could be negatively impacted.             Unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets could adversely affect the Registrants  businesses in several ways, including the availability and cost of short-term funds
for liquidity requirements, the Registrants  ability to meet long-term commitments, Generation s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy markets; each could negatively impact
the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet
their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from the Registrants  respective operations. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could adversely affect the
Registrants  ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The Registrants  access to funds under their credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to
the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests
from the Registrants and other borrowers within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased
regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, changes to Generation s hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral-posting requirements,
or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash.            In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe. Disruptions in the European markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants  ability to secure sufficient liquidity
or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 25%, or $2.1 billion of the Registrants  available credit facilities were with European banks. The credit facilities include $8.4 billion in aggregate total
commitments of which $6.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2015. There were no borrowings under the Registrants  credit facilities as of December 31, 2015. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.            The strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and
legislative and regulatory initiatives that may affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and
competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of   
         38   

Table of Contents  

the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement
of long-term contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations or cash flows.         
   If any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its
agreements with its trading counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Generation s business is subject to credit
quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to
satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount of
collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time is dependent on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and
(3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Generation could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit
rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general, or Generation in particular, has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating
agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation. Generation has project-specific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings. Failure to meet those arrangements
could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment
were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral.         
  ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s operating agreements with PJM and PECO s and BGE s natural gas procurement contracts contain
collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and ComEd, PECO and BGE were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt
ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their liquidity. Collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and
decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO and BGE, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. Given the
relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral requirements can be volatile. In addition, if ComEd, PECO and BGE were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.   
        ComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any
of the credit rating agencies conclude that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general, or ComEd, PECO, or BGE in particular, has deteriorated. ComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a
downgrade if the current regulatory environments in Illinois, Pennsylvania or Maryland, respectively, become less predictable by materially lowering returns for utilities in the applicable state or adopting other measures to limit electricity
prices. Additionally, the ratings for ComEd, PECO or BGE could be downgraded if their financial results are weakened from current levels due to weaker operating performance or due to a failure to properly manage their capital structure. In addition,
changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE.   
         39   

Table of Contents  

   ComEd, PECO and BGE conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other
arrangements and procedures intended to assure that ComEd, PECO and BGE are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate ComEd, PECO and BGE from Exelon and other Exelon
subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as  ring-fencing ) may help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO and BGE in the event
of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of
Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE, or all three. A reduction in the credit rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE could have a material adverse effect on ComEd, PECO or BGE, respectively.   
        See Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Market Conditions and
Security Ratings for further information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants  cash flows.         
   Generation s financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility, availability and other risk factors associated with the procurement of
nuclear and fossil fuel. (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate its generating facilities. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term
uranium supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. Natural gas and oil are procured for generating plants through annual, short-term and
spot-market purchases. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions and counterparty default that could negatively affect the results of operations or cash flows for
Generation.             Generation s risk management policies cannot fully
eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities. (Exelon and Generation)             Generation s asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation attempts to
manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when
its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect.
Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot
predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on its business, operating results, cash flows or financial positions.   
        Generation buys and sells energy and other products and enters into
financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation s power generation portfolio. The proportion of hedged positions in its power generation portfolio could expose Generation to volatility in future results of
operations.             Financial performance and load requirements could be
adversely affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio. (Exelon and Generation)          
  A significant portion of Generation s power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with ComEd, PECO, BGE and other
customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio   
         40   

Table of Contents  

are not needed for that purpose, Generation s output is sold in the wholesale power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers
under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation s financial results could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its
power portfolio and effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.             Challenges to tax positions taken by the Registrants as well as tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact the
Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
    Corporate Tax Reform.   There exists the potential for comprehensive tax reform in the United States that may significantly change the
tax rules applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations. Exelon cannot assess what the overall effect of such potential legislation could be on its results of operations or cash flows.   
          1999 sale of fossil generating assets.   The IRS has
challenged Exelon s 1999 tax position on its like-kind exchange transaction. Exelon and the IRS failed to reach a settlement on the like-kind exchange position and Exelon filed a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the
United States Tax Court and the trial took place in August 2015. Exelon was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the like-kind exchange position. The litigation could take three to five years including
appeals, if necessary.            As of December 31, 2015, if the
IRS is successful in its challenge to the like-kind exchange position, Exelon s potential cash outflow, including tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable may be as much as $760 million, of which
approximately $280 million would be attributable to ComEd after consideration of Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless. In addition to attempting to impose tax on the like-kind exchange position, the IRS has asserted approximately $90
million of penalties for a substantial understatement of tax. The timing effects of the final resolution of the like-kind exchange matter are unknown. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.              Tax reserves.   The
Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax
matters. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. See Notes 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 Income
Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Increases in customer rates and the impact of economic downturns could lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. Additionally, increased rates could lead to decreased volumes delivered. Both
of these factors could decrease Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results from operations or cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s current procurement plans
include purchasing power through contracted suppliers and in the spot market. ComEd s and PECO s costs of purchased power are charged to customers without a return or profit component. BGE s SOS rates charged to customers recover
BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include a return component. For PECO, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers with no return or profit component. For BGE, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers using a MBR
mechanism that compares the actual cost of gas to a market index. The difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally   
         41

between shareholders and customers. Purchased power and natural gas prices fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand. Significantly higher rates related to purchased power and natural
gas could result in declines in customer usage, lower revenues and potentially additional uncollectible accounts expense for ComEd, PECO and BGE. In addition, any challenges by the regulators or ComEd, PECO and BGE as to the recoverability of these
costs could have a material effect on the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. Also, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s cash flows could be affected by differences between the time period when electricity and natural gas are
purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers.         
  Further, the impacts of economic downturns on ComEd, PECO and BGE customers and purchased natural gas costs for PECO and BGE customers, such as
unemployment for residential customers and less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, could result in an increase in the number
of uncollectible customer balances, which would negatively impact ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of operations or cash flows. Generation s customer-facing energy delivery activities face economic downturn risks similar to
Exelon s utility businesses, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances. As Generation increases its customer-facing energy delivery activities, economic downturn impacts could negatively affect
Generation s results of operations or cash flows. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for further discussion of the Registrants  credit risk.             The effects of weather could impact the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)             Weather conditions directly influence the demand
for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to
increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at ComEd and PECO. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE recognizes revenues at MDPSC-approved levels per
customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a billing period, and is not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress ComEd s,
PECO s and BGE s transmission and distribution systems, communication systems and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company s ability to meet peak customer demand. These extreme
conditions could have detrimental effects on ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of operations or cash flows. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make
period comparisons less relevant.            Generation s
operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation could require greater resources to
meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the availability of generation and its transmission, limiting Generation s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like
conditions limiting water usage could impact Generation s ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, could have an adverse effect by causing Generation to seek additional
capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak.

    Certain long-lived assets and other assets recorded on the Registrants  statements of financial position could
become impaired, which would result in write-offs of the impaired amounts. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants  statement of financial positions. Specifically, long-lived
assets account for 60%, 56%, 66%, 69% and 80% of total assets for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. In addition, Exelon and Generation have significant balances related to unamortized energy
contracts. See Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Exelon s unamortized energy contracts. The Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of
long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the
condition of assets are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment. An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the
impairment, and such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations.         
  Exelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia that are subject to long-term leases. The investments are accounted for as direct financing
lease investments. The investments represent the estimated residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records a
non-cash impairment charge to expense if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. Such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s results of
operations.            Exelon and ComEd had approximately $2.7 billion
of goodwill recorded at December 31, 2015 in connection with the merger between PECO and Unicom Corporation, the former parent company of ComEd. Under GAAP, goodwill remains at its recorded amount unless it is determined to be impaired, which
is generally based upon an annual analysis that compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the impaired goodwill will be written-off to expense, which will also reduce equity. The
actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments will depend on many sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables. A successful IRS challenge to Exelon s and ComEd s like-kind exchange income tax position, adverse regulatory
actions such as early termination of EIMA, or changes in significant assumptions used in estimating ComEd s fair value (e.g., discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, operating and capital expenditure
requirements and the fair value of debt) could result in an impairment. Such an impairment would result in a non-cash charge to expense, which could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and ComEd s results of operations.   
        See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 8 Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on long-lived asset and goodwill impairments.             The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability.
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The
Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in electric generating facilities and by ComEd, PECO and BGE in transmission and   
         43   

Table of Contents  

distribution infrastructure projects. These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is
subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants  control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants  results of operations, financial conditions, or cash flows could
be adversely affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. Furthermore, operational failure of electric or gas systems or infrastructure could result in potential liability if such failure
results in damage to property or injury to individuals. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS for further information regarding the Registrants  potential future capital expenditures.   
         Exelon and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which
could result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third parties. In addition, the Registrants have rights under agreements which obligate third parties to indemnify the Registrants for various obligations, and the Registrants
could incur substantial costs in the event that the applicable Registrant is unable to enforce those agreements or the applicable third-party is otherwise unable to perform. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third
parties, which obligate one or more of the Registrants or their subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to
fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial conditions, or cash flows of the Registrants.            The Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a
Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the
affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations, which could impact that Registrant s results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed
certain of ComEd s and PECO s rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd and PECO could have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd or
PECO for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party or Generation experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the
indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, ComEd or PECO could be liable for any existing or future claims, which could impact ComEd s or PECO s results of operations, cash flows or financial positions.   
          Regulatory and Legislative Factors     
         The Registrants  generation and energy delivery businesses are highly
regulated and could be subject to regulatory and legislative actions that adversely affect their operations or financial results. Fundamental changes in regulation or legislation or violation of tariffs or market rules and anti-manipulation laws,
could disrupt the Registrants  business plans and adversely affect their operations or financial results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Substantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation. Further,
Exelon s and Generation s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent upon the ability of Generation to sell power at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates, and Exelon s,
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customers.
  
         44

Similarly, there is risk that financial market regulations could increase the Registrants  compliance costs and limit their ability to engage in certain transactions. In the planning and
management of operations, the Registrants must address the effects of regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by Federal and state legislatures, RTOs, exchanges, ratemaking agencies and taxing
authorities. Additionally, the Registrants need to be cognizant and understand rule changes or Registrant actions that could result in potential violation of tariffs, market rules and anti-manipulation laws. Fundamental changes in regulations or
other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants  businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations and could negatively impact their results of operations, cash flows or financial positions.
           Regulatory and legislative developments related to climate
change and RPS could also significantly affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change through GHG emission reductions, if
enacted, could result in increased costs to entities that generate electricity through carbon-emitting fossil fuels, which could increase the market price at which all generators in a region, including Generation, may sell their output, thereby
increasing the revenue Generation could realize from its low-carbon nuclear assets. However, national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an RPS could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities in the
Midwest, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation s Midwest nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets
under a carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. Similarly, final regulations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act may not provide sufficient incentives for states to utilize carbon-free nuclear power as a means
of meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, while continuing a policy of favoring renewable energy sources. Current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentives for regional wind development. The
Registrants cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.   
         Generation could be negatively affected by possible Federal or state legislative or
regulatory actions that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets. (Exelon and Generation)          
  Federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are facing pressures to address consumer concerns, or are themselves raising concerns, that
energy prices in wholesale markets are too high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working, and, therefore, are considering some form of re-regulation or some other means of reducing wholesale market
prices or subsidizing new generation. Generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy markets to achieve its business objectives.         
  Approximately 65% of Generation s generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts,
are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation s future results of operations will depend on (1) FERC s continued adherence to and support for, policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets, such
as PJM s, and (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competitiveness. Generation could also be adversely affected by state laws, regulations or initiatives designed
to reduce wholesale prices artificially below competitive levels or to subsidize new generation, such as the subsequently dismissed New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the MDPSC s RFP for new gas-fired generation in Maryland. See Note
3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the Maryland new electric generation requirements.   
         45   

Table of Contents  

   In addition, FERC s application of its Order 697 and its subsequent revisions could pose a risk
that Generation will have difficulty satisfying FERC s tests for market-based rates. Since Order 697 became final in June 2007, Generation has obtained orders affirming Generation s authority to sell at market-based rates and none denying
that authority.            The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted in July 2010. The part of the Act that applies to Exelon is Title VII, which is known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank requires the creation of a
new regulatory regime for over-the-counter swaps (swaps), including mandatory clearing for certain categories of Swaps, incentives to shift swap activity to exchange trading, margin and capital requirements, and other obligations designed to promote
transparency. For non security-based swaps including commodity swaps, Dodd-Frank empowers the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to promulgate regulations implementing the law s objectives. The primary aim of Dodd-Frank is to regulate
the key intermediaries in the swaps market, which entities are either swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), and certain other financial entities, but the law also applies to a lesser degree to end-users of swaps. On January 12,
2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. Moreover, the CFTC s Dodd-Frank regulations preserve the ability of end users in the energy
industry to hedge their risks using swaps without being subject to mandatory clearing, and accepts or exempts end-users from many of the other substantive regulations. Accordingly, as an end-user, Generation is conducting its commercial business in
a manner that does not require registration with the CFTC as an SD or MSP. Generation does not anticipate transacting in the future in a manner in which it would become a SD or MSP.            There are, however, some rulemakings that have not yet been finalized, including the capital and margin rules for
(non-cleared) swaps. Generation does not expect these rules to directly impact its collateral requirements. However, depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development
and that are similar to Dodd-Frank, Generation s swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements. These regulations could motivate the SDs and MSPs to increase collateral requirements
or cash postings from their counterparties, including Generation.            Generation continues to monitor the rulemaking proceedings with respect to the capital and margin rules, but cannot predict to what extent, if any, further refinements to Dodd-Frank requirements may impact its cash
flows or financial position, but such impacts could be material.            ComEd, PECO and BGE could also be subject to some Dodd-Frank requirements to the extent they were to enter into swaps. However, at this time, management of ComEd, PECO and BGE continue to expect that their
companies will not be materially affected by Dodd-Frank.         
   Generation s affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation s physical asset base within
the ComEd, PECO and BGE service territories, could increase Generation s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding ComEd, PECO and/or BGE retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory
requirements funded in part by Generation. (Exelon and Generation)             Generation has significant generating resources within the service areas of ComEd, PECO and BGE and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by
developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of Generation s affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by
increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups may question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by   
         46   

Table of Contents  

ComEd, PECO, or BGE, with Generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The prospect of such challenges may increase the time,
complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges may subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition, government officials and
legislators could seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes and contributions to rate-relief packages.   
         The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related
to environmental and other matters. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The businesses which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the
Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of these emission and disposal requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement
actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties  claims for alleged health or property damages or operating
restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by
hazardous substances they generate. The Registrants have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance, site remediation and clean-up. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by
predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the
future.            If application of Section 316(b) of the Clean
Water Act, which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic organisms at existing generating stations, requires the retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this
development could result in material costs of compliance. Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by
December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029. On June 30, 2015, NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for Salem. The draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to
continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system. The draft permit is subject to a public notice and comment period after which the NJDEP may make revisions before issuing the final permit expected during the first half
of 2016.            Additionally, Generation is subject to exposure
for asbestos-related personal injury liability alleged at certain current and formerly owned generation facilities. Future legislative action could require Generation to make a material contribution to a fund to settle lawsuits for alleged
asbestos-related disease and exposure.            In some cases, a
third-party who has acquired assets from a Registrant has assumed the liability the Registrant could otherwise have for environmental matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee is unable, or fails, to discharge the assumed
liability, a regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold the Registrant responsible, and the Registrant s remedies against the transferee may be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. See Note 23 Commitments
and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

    Changes in ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s respective terms and conditions of service, including their
respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in
effectuating rate changes. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  ComEd, PECO and BGE are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their
respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of
limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The proceedings generally have timelines that may not be limited by statute. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The
potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for ComEd, PECO or BGE to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are
also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, bad debt, MGP remediation, smart
grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.            In certain instances, ComEd, PECO and BGE may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.
           ComEd, PECO and BGE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of
any settlements or the actions by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland or Federal regulators in establishing rates, including the extent, if any, to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will
be allowed. Nevertheless, the expectation is that ComEd, PECO and BGE will continue to be obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and will also retain significant default service obligations, referred to
as POLR, DSP and SOS for ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, to provide electricity and natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose an alternative supplier. The ultimate outcome and timing of
regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE, as applicable, to recover their costs and could have a material adverse effect on ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of operations, cash flows
and financial position. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding rate proceedings.   
         Federal or additional state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with
energy conservation by customers, could negatively affect the results of operations or cash flows of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Changes to current state legislation or the development of Federal
legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed. The impact could
include increased costs for RECs and purchased power and increased rates for customers.            Federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, have increased capital
expenditures and could significantly impact ComEd, PECO and BGE, if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new
energy conservation technologies could   
         48

lead to a decline in the revenues of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO. For additional information, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Environmental Regulation-Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio
Standards.              The impact of not meeting the criteria of the FASB
guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation could be material to Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  As of December 31, 2015, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE have concluded that the operations of ComEd, PECO and BGE meet the criteria of the
authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of their businesses no longer meets the criteria, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE would be required to
eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of their business. That action would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in their Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
recognition of a one-time charge in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The impact of not meeting the criteria of the authoritative guidance could be material to the financial statements of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and
BGE. At December 31, 2015, the gain (loss) could have been as much as $(2.5) billion, $978 million and $559 million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s regulatory assets and liabilities,
respectively. Further, Exelon would record a charge against OCI (before taxes) of up to $2.5 billion and $634 million for ComEd and BGE, respectively, related to Exelon s net regulatory assets associated with its defined benefit postretirement
plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $47 million (before taxes) associated with PECO s defined benefit postretirement plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed. The impacts and resolution of the above items could
lead to an additional impairment of ComEd s goodwill, which could be significant and at least partially offset the gain at ComEd discussed above. A significant decrease in equity as a result of any changes could limit the ability of ComEd, PECO
and BGE to pay dividends under Federal and state law and no longer meeting the regulatory accounting criteria could cause significant volatility in future results of operations. See Notes 1 Significant Accounting Policies, 3 Regulatory
Matters and 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounting for the effects of regulation, regulatory matters and ComEd s goodwill, respectively.   
         Exelon and Generation could incur material costs of compliance if Federal and/or
state regulation or legislation is adopted to address climate change. (Exelon and Generation)             Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors, including utilities, are considering ways to address
the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. In 2009, select Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states implemented a model rule, developed via the RGGI, to regulate CO2 emissions from fossil-fired generation. RGGI states are working on updated programs to
further limit emissions and the EPA has introduced regulation to address greenhouse gases from new fossil plants that could potentially impact existing plants. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, Exelon and Generation
may incur costs either to limit further the GHG emissions from their operations or to procure emission allowance credits. For example, more stringent permitting requirements may preclude the construction of lower-carbon nuclear and gas-fired power
plants. Similarly, a Federal RPS could increase the cost of compliance by mandating the purchase or construction of more expensive supply alternatives. For more information regarding climate change, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Global Climate
Change  and Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    The Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards,
including the likely exposure of ComEd, PECO, and BGE to the results of PJM s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and
operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. As operators of natural gas distribution systems, PECO and BGE are
also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market
interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC impose certain distribution
reliability standards on ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include
substantial monetary penalties.            ComEd, PECO and BGE as
transmission owners are subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments could require ComEd, PECO and BGE to incur incremental
capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards.         
  See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.             The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of
the legal proceedings relating to their business activities. An adverse determination could negatively impact their results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising out of their business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could
require significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants  results of operations.         
   Generation could be negatively affected by possible Nuclear Regulatory Commission actions that could affect the operations and profitability of its nuclear
generating fleet. (Exelon and Generation)          
    Regulatory risk   .  A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial
increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial positions. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those
owned by Generation, could cause the NRC to initiate such actions.              Spent nuclear fuel storage.   The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF, such as the one previously considered at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will
significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs. The NRC s temporary storage rule (also referred to as the  waste confidence
decision ) recognizes that licensees can safely store spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power plants for up to 60 years beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants. In June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the
DC Circuit vacated the NRC s temporary storage rule on the grounds that the NRC should have conducted a more comprehensive   
         50

environmental review to support the rule. On September 19, 2014, the NRC issued a revised rule codifying the NRC s generic determinations regarding the environmental impacts of
continued storage of spent nuclear fuel beyond a reactor s licensed operating life. The Continued Storage Rule became effective on October 20, 2014.         
  Any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF could adversely affect Generation s ability to
decommission fully its nuclear units. Through May 15, 2014, in accordance with the NWPA and Generation s contract with the DOE, Generation paid the DOE a fee per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. On
November 19, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. On
January 3, 2014, the DOE filed a petition for rehearing which was denied by the D.C. Circuit Court on March 18, 2014. Also, on January 3, 2014, the DOE submitted a proposal to Congress to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to zero.
On May 9, 2014, the DOE notified Generation that the SNF disposal fee was set to zero, effective May 16, 2014. Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF
disposal fees. Generation currently estimates 2025 to be the earliest date when the DOE will begin accepting SNF, which could be delayed by further regulatory action. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the spent nuclear fuel obligation. Generation cannot predict what, if any, fee will be established in the future for SNF disposal. However, such a fee could be material to
Generation s results of operations or cash flows.         
    License renewals.   Generation cannot assure that economics will support the continued operation of the facilities for all or any
portion of any renewed license period. If the NRC does not renew the operating licenses for Generation s nuclear stations or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could be
adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. In
addition, Generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.         
    Operational Factors           
   The Registrants  employees, contractors, customers and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry.
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Employees
and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near their operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at
risk for serious injury, including loss of life. Significant risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.   
         Natural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other
significant events could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations, its ability to raise capital and its future growth. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Generation s fleet of power plants and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s distribution and transmission
infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters, such as seismic activity, more frequent and more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, sea level rise and
other related phenomena. Severe weather or other natural   
         51   

Table of Contents  

disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants  service areas can also directly affect
their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. An example of such an event was the February 5, 2014 ice storm, which interrupted electric service delivery
to customers in PECO s service territory and resulted in significant restoration costs.            Another example of such an event includes the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami experienced by Japan on March 11, 2011, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. Natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or legislative bodies may change the laws or regulations governing, among
other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects. In addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and
economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units. Additionally, natural disasters and other events that have an adverse effect on the economy in
general may adversely affect the Registrants  operations and their ability to raise capital.            Exelon does not know the impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry in general and on Exelon in particular. As owner-operators of infrastructure facilities, such as nuclear, fossil and
hydroelectric generation facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities, the Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Any retaliatory military
strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise
the physical or cyber security of Exelon s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic,
credit crises, recession or other factors also may result in a decline in energy consumption, which may adversely affect the Registrants  results of operations and its ability to raise capital. In addition, the implementation of security
guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.            The Registrants would be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to
workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected, resulting in decreased service levels and increased costs.   
        In addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent
with industry practices against property and casualty losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will
be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.         
   Generation s financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities. (Exelon and
Generation)               Nuclear capacity factors.  
Capacity factors for generating units, particularly capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation s results of operations. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs but produce
electricity at low variable costs due to nuclear fuel costs typically being lower than fossil fuel costs. Consequently, to be successful, Generation must consistently operate its nuclear facilities at high capacity factors. Lower capacity
  
         52   

Table of Contents  

factors increase Generation s operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward
markets in order to satisfy Generation s obligations to committed third-party sales, including ComEd, PECO and BGE. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.   
          Nuclear refueling outages.   In general, refueling outages
are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, could have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or
Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales.   
          Nuclear fuel quality   .  The quality of nuclear fuel
utilized by Generation could affect the efficiency and costs of Generation s operations. Certain of Generation s nuclear units have previously had a limited number of fuel performance issues. Remediation actions could result in increased
costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.         
    Operational risk   .  Operations at any of Generation s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation
has to shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time and expense. Generation could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of
restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, Generation may not achieve the anticipated results
under its series of planned power uprates across its nuclear fleet. For plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation could also incur liability to the co-owners. For plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from
which Generation receives a portion of the plants  output, Generation s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants.
Additionally, poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy, which could significantly affect Generation s results of operations or
financial positions. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of
electricity in markets served by Generation.              Nuclear
major incident risk.   Although the safety record of nuclear reactors generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the United States and abroad. The consequences of a major incident could be
severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, could exceed Generation s resources, including
insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation and could have a material adverse effect on Generation s results of operations or financial
positions. Additionally, an accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, owned by others or Generation, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy and
significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial positions.              Nuclear insurance.   As required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance. The required amount of nuclear liability insurance is $375
million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims
exceeding the $13.5 billion limit for a single incident.   
         53   

Table of Contents  

   Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which provides property and
business interruption insurance for Generation s nuclear operations. In previous years, NEIL has made distributions to its members but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will occur at all. See Note
23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of nuclear insurance.         
    Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds
will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired and units that are
within five years of retirement) addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC-estimated funding levels including scheduled contributions to and earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. The NRC funding levels are based upon the assumption
that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.            Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. The performance of
capital markets also could significantly affect the value of the trust funds. Currently, Generation is making contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to
Generation. While Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other
nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from
PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former PECO units could be negatively
affected and Exelon s and Generation s results of operations or financial positions could be significantly affected. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
           Ultimately, if the investments held by Generation s
NDTs are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation s nuclear units, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional
contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Generation s cash flows or financial positions could be
significantly adversely affected. Additionally, if the pledged assets are not sufficient to fund the Zion station decommissioning activities under the Asset Sale Agreement (ASA), Generation could have to seek remedies available under the ASA to
reduce the risk of default by ZionSolutions and its parent. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Generation s financial performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of
hydroelectric facilities. (Exelon and Generation)             FERC
has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project expires September 1,
2016, and the license for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Project expires on December 1, 2055. FERC is required to issue annual licenses for the facilities until a final determination is made on the license renewal. Generation cannot predict
whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the
end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could   
         54   

Table of Contents  

be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that
license renewal will be received. Generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could
adversely affect operations, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial positions. Similar effects could
result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation.   
         ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s operating costs, and customers  and
regulators  opinions of ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Failures of the equipment or facilities, including information
systems, used in ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could negatively impact related revenues, and increase maintenance and capital
expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, smart grid or other technologies in
ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of operations, cash flows or
financial conditions could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial results could be
negatively impacted. If an employee causes the operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating the operational systems, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial results
could also be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.
           The aforementioned failures or those of other utilities,
including prolonged or repeated failures, could affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s maintenance and capital expenditures. Regulated utilities, which are required to provide
service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its
customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, and those damages could be material to ComEd s results of operations or cash flows. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding proceedings related to storm-related outages in ComEd s service territory.   
         ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s respective ability to deliver electricity,
their operating costs and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Demand for electricity within ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring
alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize ComEd s,
PECO s and BGE s ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in
PJM or FERC requiring ComEd, PECO and BGE to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.   
         55   

Table of Contents  

    The Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            The Registrants face physical security and
cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities and as a participant in commodities trading. Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas
utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information, grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructures, and such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
dynamic. Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increase the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. A security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, interconnected
entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject the Registrants to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of
certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data. The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while we have been, and will likely
continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date we have not experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication
and frequency, we may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of Exelon and its customer supply activities may be adversely affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in
the industry may be diminished, or Exelon and its subsidiaries may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations. Moreover, the amount and
scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result. ComEd s,
PECO s and BGE s deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories may increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties. In addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen
threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
         Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively
impact the Registrants  results of operations. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the
Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs,
could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and distribution operations. If the Registrants are unable to successfully
attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.             The Registrants could make investments in new business initiatives, including initiatives mandated by regulators, and markets that may not be successful, and acquisitions could not achieve the intended financial
results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Generation continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain.
Generation is pursuing investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, distributed generation, potential expansion of the existing natural gas and oil Upstream and wholesale gas businesses, and entry into
  
         56   

Table of Contents  

liquefied natural gas. Such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and
unidentified issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. As these markets mature, there could be new market entrants or expansion by established competitors that increase competition for
customers and resources. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than
expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment.            ComEd, PECO and BGE face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated Smart Grid initiatives. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity and obsolescence of
technology. Due to these risks, no assurance can be given that such initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial results.   
          Risks Related to the Pending Merger with PHI     
         Exelon and PHI could encounter difficulties in satisfying the conditions for the
completion of the Merger and the Merger could not be completed within the expected time frame or at all.          
  Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (1) the receipt of regulatory
approvals required to consummate the Merger, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and (3) other customary closing conditions, including (a) the accuracy of each party s
representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (b) each party s compliance with its obligations and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligation of Exelon to consummate the
Merger is subject to the required regulatory approvals not, individually or in the aggregate, imposing terms, conditions, obligations or commitments that constitute a burdensome condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement).   
        In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that either Exelon or PHI
could terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not completed by October 28, 2015. Exelon and PHI have agreed, among other things, that they will not exercise their rights to terminate the Merger Agreement before March 4, 2016,
except under limited circumstances.            See Note
4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the status of the Merger.   
         The Merger is subject to the receipt of consent or approval from governmental
entities that could delay the completion of the Merger or impose conditions that could cause abandonment of the Merger.          
  Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of consents, orders, approvals or clearances, to the extent required, from various
regulatory authorities, including the DCPSC and the public utility commissions or similar entities in certain states in which the companies operate. The Merger has been approved by the Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC), the Maryland Public
Service Commission (MDPSC), the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Approval of the Merger by the MDPSC is subject to appeals by the Maryland Office of People s Counsel, the Sierra
Club/Chesapeake Climate Action Network and Public Citizen, Inc. in the Circuit Court of Queen Anne s County, and the approval by the NJBPU expires on June 30, 2016. The HSR Act waiting period applicable to the Merger expired on
December 2, 2015. The Merger remains subject to approval by the DCPSC. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the status of
regulatory approvals.   
         57   

Table of Contents  

   Exelon and PHI have proposed conditions for approval in the filings that have been made with the DCPSC
and other regulatory commissions. The conditions of approval of the Merger by the DCPSC will trigger the  most favored nation  provisions in the approvals of the Merger by the DPSC, MDPSC, and the NJBPU.   
        Exelon cannot provide assurance that all required regulatory consents
or approvals will be obtained or that these consents or approvals will not contain terms, conditions or restrictions that would be unacceptable. The Merger Agreement generally permits Exelon to terminate the Merger Agreement if the final terms of
any of the required regulatory consents or approvals include burdensome conditions (as defined in the Merger Agreement).         
   Failure to obtain regulatory approval could result in Exelon s payment of a reverse termination fee.    
        If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances due
to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, the failure to obtain regulatory approvals without burdensome conditions, or the breach by Exelon of its obligations in respect of obtaining regulatory approvals, Exelon will be required to pay PHI a
reverse termination fee of $180 million, which would occur by means of PHI s election to redeem the outstanding nonvoting preferred securities purchased by Exelon in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement for no consideration
other than the nominal par value of the stock. In these circumstances, Exelon will also be required to reimburse PHI for up to $40 million of its documented out-of-pocket expenses for the Merger.   
         Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the share price and the
future business and financial results of Exelon.             If
the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Exelon could be negatively impacted and Exelon will be subject to several risks, including:         

having to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger, including a termination fee of up to $180 million
payable by Exelon to PHI under certain circumstances; and            

the share price of Exelon could decline if and to the extent that the current market prices reflect an assumption by the market that the Merger will be
completed.                Exelon and PHI have incurred and will incur
significant transaction and Merger-related costs in connection with the Merger.             Exelon and PHI have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. Most of these costs will be transaction costs, including fees paid to financial
and legal advisors related to the Merger and related financing arrangements, and employment-related costs, including change-in- control related payments made to certain PHI executives. In addition, until the closing of the Merger, Exelon will be
required to pay financing costs without having realized any benefits from the Merger during the period of delay. Exelon will also incur transition costs related to formulating integration plans. Exelon expects that the elimination of costs, as well
as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, will exceed incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time.   
         58   

Table of Contents  

    Exelon may not realize all the expected benefits of the Merger because of integration difficulties.    
        The success of the PHI acquisition will depend, in part, on
Exelon s ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating PHI s business with Exelon s existing businesses. The integration process could be complex, costly and time-consuming. The challenges associated with
integrating the operations of PHI s business include, among others:         

delay in implementation of our business plan for the combined business;      

unanticipated issues or costs in integrating financial, information technology, communications and other systems;      

possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures between PHI  s structure and our structure; and

difficulties in retention of key employees.            
   Exelon and PHI will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that could negatively impact their ability to attract and retain key
employees, and potentially impact the company s financial results.             Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers could have a negative impact on Exelon and/or PHI. These uncertainties could impair Exelon s and/or PHI s ability to
attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, as employees and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. In addition,
current and prospective Exelon and PHI employees could determine that they do not desire to work for the combined company for a variety of possible reasons. Moreover, the pendency of Merger regulatory-review proceedings has caused PHI to delay
filing base rate cases on behalf of its utilities Pepco, ACE and Delmarva which have had a material impact to their results of operations and cash flows.         
   The Merger could divert attention of management at Exelon and PHI, which could detract from efforts to meet business goals.    
        The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration
could place a burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect Exelon s
and/or PHI s financial results.             Exelon is obligated to complete the
Merger whether or not it has obtained the required financing.             Exelon intended to fund the cash consideration in the Merger using a combination of debt, cash from asset sales, the issuance of equity (including mandatory convertible securities). See Note 4 Mergers,
Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the merger financing. Although Exelon had sufficient cash to fund the cash
consideration in the Merger as of September 30, 2015, a $2.75 billion portion of the debt incurred to finance the cash consideration was subject to mandatory special redemption on December 31, 2015. On December 2, 2015, the holders of
$1.9 billion of that debt exchanged those debt securities for new notes that extend the mandatory special redemption date from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 (or later under some circumstances), and on December 2, 2015, Exelon
redeemed $868 million of the debt. Exelon could be required to raise additional cash to fund the cash consideration in the Merger.   
         59

    The combined company s assets, liabilities or results of operations could be negatively impacted by unknown or
unexpected events, conditions or actions that might occur at PHI prior to the closing of the Merger.          
  The PHI assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, cash flows, operating results and prospects to be acquired or assumed by Exelon by
reason of the Merger could be negatively impacted before or after the Merger closing as a result of previously unknown events or conditions occurring or existing before the Merger closing. Adverse changes in PHI s business or operations could
occur or arise as a result of actions by PHI, legal or regulatory developments including the emergence or unfavorable resolution of pre-acquisition loss contingencies, deteriorating general business, market, industry or economic conditions, and
other factors both within and beyond the control of PHI. A significant decline in the value of PHI assets to be acquired by Exelon or a significant increase in PHI liabilities to be assumed by Exelon could negatively impact the combined
company s future business, operating results, cash flows, financial conditions or prospects.             Exelon could record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect its operating results.          
  In accordance with GAAP, the Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of PHI common stock by Exelon and will follow the acquisition method of
accounting for business combinations. The assets and liabilities of PHI will be consolidated with those of Exelon. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of PHI s assets and liabilities, if any, will be recorded as goodwill.
           The amount of goodwill, which could be material, will be
allocated to the appropriate reporting units of the combined company. Exelon is required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. To the extent
the carrying value of any of those reporting units is greater than the fair value, a second step comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount would be required to determine if the goodwill is impaired. Such a potential
impairment could result in a material non-cash charge that would have a material impact on Exelon s future operating results or financial positions.         
   Legal proceedings in connection with the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.    
        One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no judgment
(whether preliminary, temporary or permanent) or other order by any court or other governmental entity shall be in effect that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger.   
        PHI and its directors have been named as defendants in purported class
action lawsuits filed on behalf of named plaintiffs and other public stockholders challenging the proposed Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. Exelon has been named
as a defendant in these lawsuits. Exelon has also been named in a federal court case with similar claims. In September 2014, the parties reached a proposed settlement which is subject to court approval. Final court approval of the proposed
settlement is not expected to occur until approximately 90 days after the Merger closing date.            If a plaintiff in these or any other litigation claims that may be filed in the future is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the terms contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the injunction could prevent the completion of the Merger in the expected time frame or altogether. If completion of the Merger is prevented or delayed, it could result in substantial costs to Exelon. In addition, Exelon could
incur significant costs in connection with the lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of PHI s directors and officers.   
         60   

Table of Contents  

    The Merger could be completed on terms different from those contained in the Merger Agreement.    
        Prior to the completion of the Merger, Exelon and PHI could, by their
mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the Merger consideration to be received by PHI stockholders or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties 
respective operations pending completion of the Merger. In addition, Exelon could choose to waive requirements of the Merger Agreement, including some conditions to closing of the Merger.

(a)  
  All nuclear stations are boiling water reactors except Braidwood, Byron, Calvert Cliffs, Ginna, Salem and Three Mile Island, which are pressurized water reactors.

(c)  
  Base-load units are plants that normally operate to take all or part of the minimum continuous load of a system and, consequently, produce electricity at an essentially constant
rate. Intermediate units are plants that normally operate to take load of a system during the daytime higher load hours and, consequently, produce electricity by cycling on and off daily. Peaking units consist of lower-efficiency, quick response
steam units, gas turbines and diesels normally used during the maximum load periods.     

(d)  
  For nuclear stations, capacity reflects the annual mean rating. Fossil stations reflect a summer rating. Wind and solar facilities reflect name plate capacity.

(e)  
  Generation has agreed to permanently cease generation operation at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.     

(f)  
  Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share.     

(g)  
  Reflects Generation s 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. For Nine Mile Point, the co-owner owns 18% of Unit 2. Thus Exelon s ownership is 50.01% of 82%
of Nine Mile Point Unit 2. Generation also had a unit-contingent PPA with CENG under which it purchased 85% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG that was not sold to third parties under the pre-existing PPAs through 2014.
    
          The net generation capability
available for operation at any time may be less due to regulatory restrictions, transmission congestion, fuel restrictions, efficiency of cooling facilities, level of water supplies or generating units being temporarily out of service for
inspection, maintenance, refueling, repairs or modifications required by regulatory authorities.            In addition to the electric generating stations, Generation has working interests in 9 natural gas and oil exploration and production properties (Upstream) across the United States. Production volumes will vary
from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price effects and other factors.   
        Generation maintains property insurance against loss or damage to its
principal plants and properties by fire or other perils, subject to certain exceptions. For additional information regarding nuclear insurance of generating facilities, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS Exelon Generation Company, LLC. For its insured
losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Generation s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

    PECO          
  As of January 31, 2016, there were 170,478,507 outstanding shares of common stock, without par value, of PECO, all of which were indirectly
held by Exelon.             BGE    
        As of January 31, 2016, there were 1,000 outstanding shares of
common stock, without par value, of BGE, all of which were indirectly held by Exelon.             Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE              Dividends             Under
applicable Federal law, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at Generation, ComEd, PECO or BGE may limit the dividends that these companies can
distribute to Exelon.            The Federal Power Act declares it to
be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly
included in capital account  is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly
disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not
believe these limitations are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.            Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and
earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with a financing arranged through ComEd
Financing III that ComEd will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III;
(2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No
such event has occurred.            PECO has agreed in connection with
financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures
which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of
default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has occurred.         
  BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, in connection with the Constellation merger, BGE was prohibited
from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to
the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend
on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid and notify the   
         70   

Table of Contents  

MDPSC that BGE s equity ratio is at least 48% within five business days after dividend payment. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends unless: (1) BGE
elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on BGE s preference stock have not been
paid.            Exelon s Board of Directors approved a revised
dividend policy. The approved policy would raise our dividend 2.5% each year for the next three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The Board will take formal action to declare the next dividend in the second quarter.   
        At December 31, 2015, Exelon had retained earnings of $12,068
million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $2,701 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $978 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,617 million, partially offset by $(1,639) million
of unappropriated retained deficits, PECO s retained earnings of $780 million, and BGE s retained earnings of $1,320 million.

   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                  Exelon          
     Executive Overview          
  Exelon, a utility services holding company, operates through the following principal subsidiaries:   

Generation,  whose integrated business consists of the generation, physical delivery and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through
its customer-facing business, Constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation also sells renewable energy and other energy-related products and services.      

As a result of the Constellation merger, Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG. During 2014, Generation assumed the operating licenses and corresponding
operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, Exelon and Generation fully consolidated CENG s financial position and results of operations into their financial statements since April 1, 2014.      

ComEd,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity transmission and distribution
services in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.            

PECO,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of electricity distribution and transmission
services in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.

BGE,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas and the provision of electricity distribution and
transmission and gas distribution services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.            
  Exelon has nine reportable segments consisting of Generation s six power marketing reportable segments (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New
York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions in Generation), ComEd, PECO and BGE. See Note 25 Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon s reportable segments.
           Through its business services subsidiary BSC, Exelon
provides its operating subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost. The costs of these services are directly charged or allocated to the applicable operating segments. Additionally, the results of Exelon s corporate operations
include costs for corporate governance and interest costs and income from various investment and financing activities.         
  Exelon s consolidated financial information includes the results of its four separate operating subsidiary registrants, Generation, ComEd, PECO
and BGE, which, along with Exelon, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. The following combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE. However, none of the Registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other Registrants.         
    Financial Results.   The following consolidated financial results reflect the results of Exelon for the year ended December 31,
2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The 2014 financial results only include the operations of CENG on a fully consolidated basis from the date Generation assumed

operational control, April 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014. All amounts presented below are before the impact of income taxes, except as noted.   

(b)  
  The Registrants  evaluate operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. The Registrants  believe that revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not
be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.           
  Exelon s net income attributable to common shareholders was $2,269 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,623
million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and diluted earnings per average common share were $2.54 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1.88 for the year ended December 31, 2014.   
        Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a
non-GAAP measure discussed below, increased by $1,937 million as compared to 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the following favorable factors:   

Increase of $666 million at Generation primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015, benefit of lower cost to
serve load (including the absence of higher procurement costs for replacement power in 2014), the cancellation of the DOE spent      
         77   

Table of Contents  

nuclear fuel disposal fee, increased capacity prices, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, favorability from portfolio management optimization activities in the Mid-Atlantic and
Midwest regions, and increased load served, partially offset by lower margins resulting from the 2014 sales of generating assets, lower realized energy prices, and the absence of the 2014 fuel optimization opportunities in the South region due to
extreme cold weather;            

Increase of $132 million at Generation related to amortization of contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions;

Increase of $228 million at ComEd primarily due to increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate revenues (reflecting the impacts of increased
capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE);            

Increase of $9 million at PECO primarily due to favorable weather and volume; and            

Increase of $82 million at BGE primarily due to increased distribution revenue pursuant to increased rates effective December 2014 as a result of the electric
and natural gas distribution rate case order issued by the Maryland PSC and increased transmission revenue.            
  The year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:

Decrease of $38 million at ComEd due to unfavorable weather and volume.      
        Operating and maintenance expense decreased by $246 million as compared
to 2014 primarily due to the following favorable factors:         

Decrease of $44 million resulting from the absence of 2014 expenses recorded for a Constellation merger commitment at Generation;      

Decreased storm costs at PECO and BGE of $78 million and $21 million, respectively;            

Decreased uncollectible accounts expense at BGE of $49 million.      
        The year-over-year decrease in operating and maintenance expense was
partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:         

Increase in Generation s labor, contracting and materials costs of $323 million primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully
consolidated basis in 2015 and increased contracting spend related to energy efficiency projects;            

Increase of $64 million as a result of an increase in the number of nuclear refueling outage days at Generation, including Salem, primarily related to the
inclusion of CENG s plants on a fully consolidated basis in 2015;            

Increase in labor, contracting and materials costs of $31 million related to preventative maintenance and other projects at ComEd;      

Increased storm costs at ComEd of $27 million;            

Increased costs associated with ComEd s uncollectible accounts expense of $27 million; and      

An increase in pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense of $47 million primarily at Exelon, Generation, and ComEd, resulting from the unfavorable
impact of lower assumed pension and OPEB discount rates for 2015 and an increase in the life expectancy assumption for plan participants in 2015, partially offset by cost savings from plan design changes for certain OPEB plans effective April 2014
and forward.      
         78   

Table of Contents  

   Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $136 million primarily as a result of the inclusion
of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015, increased nuclear decommissioning amortization at Generation, and increased depreciation expense across the operating companies for ongoing capital expenditures.   
        Taxes other than income increased $46 million primarily due to the
inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015 and increased sales and use tax at Corporate.         
  Gain on sales of assets decreased $419 million as a result of the absence of 2014 gains recorded on the sales of ownership interest in certain
generating stations.            Gain on consolidation and acquisition
of businesses decreased by $289 million due to a $261 million gain upon consolidation of CENG in 2014 resulting from the difference in fair value of CENG s net assets as of April 1, 2014, and the equity method investment previously
recorded on Generation s and Exelon s books and the settlement of pre-existing transactions between Generation and CENG, and a $28 million bargain-purchase gain in 2014 related to the Integrys acquisition.   
        Interest expense decreased by $32 million primarily as a result of
mark-to market gains in 2015 as compared to mark-to-market losses in 2014 associated with an interest rate swap terminated in June 2015, partially offset by higher debt in 2015 related to financing activities associated with the pending PHI merger.
           Other, net decreased by $501 million primarily at
Generation as a result of the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT funds.            Exelon s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 32.2% and 26.8%, respectively. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.            For further detail regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, including explanation of the non-GAAP measure revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the
discussions of Results of Operations by Segment below.              Adjusted
(non-GAAP) Operating Earnings              Exelon s
adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,227 million, or $2.49 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2,068 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, for the same period
in 2014. In addition to net income, Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an
indication of Exelon s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators
management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and
may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

Merger and Acquisition Costs              As presented in the table above, Exelon has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Integrys and PHI acquisitions including employee-related expenses (e.g. severance, retirement, relocation
and retention bonuses), financing costs, integration initiatives, and certain pre-acquisition contingencies.         
  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, expense has been recognized for costs incurred to achieve the Constellation merger, CENG
integration, Integrys acquisition and pending PHI acquisition as follows:         

(a)

Table of Contents  

(d)  
  Reflects costs incurred at Generation for a Constellation merger commitment for the year ended December 31, 2014.     

(e)  
  Costs primarily for employee severance, pension and OPEB expense and retention bonuses.     
        As of December 31, 2015, Exelon projects incurring total PHI
acquisition and integration related costs of approximately $700 million, excluding the amounts Exelon and PHI are committed, if approved, to provide to the PHI utility s respective customers. Of this amount, including 2014 and through
December 31, 2015, Exelon has incurred approximately $300 million of costs associated with the proposed merger. Included in this amount are costs to fund the merger of which $76 million has been expensed, $56 million has been paid and recorded
as deferred debt issuance costs and $60 million has been incurred and charged to common stock. The remaining costs will be primarily within Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income and will also include approximately $60 million for integration costs expected to be capitalized to Property, plant and equipment. The increase from the previous estimate of $635 million is due to higher transaction costs
primarily driven by the merger delay. This increase in transaction costs is partially offset by lower integration costs.         
  Pursuant to the conditions set forth by the MDPSC in its approval of the Constellation merger transaction, Exelon committed to provide a package of
benefits to BGE customers, and make certain investments in the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of Maryland of approximately $1 billion. The direct investment estimate includes $95
million to $120 million for the requirement to cause construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses. On March 20, 2013, Generation signed a twenty year lease agreement for office space
that was contingent upon the developer obtaining all required approvals, permits and financing for the construction of a building in Baltimore, Maryland. The operating lease became effective during the second quarter of 2014 when these outstanding
contingencies were met by the developer. Construction began late in the second quarter of 2014 and the building is expected to be ready for occupancy by the end of 2016. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the lease commitments.             Exelon s Strategy and Outlook for 2016 and Beyond             Exelon s value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline. Exelon leverages its integrated business model to create
value. Exelon s regulated and competitive businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value proposition:   

Exelon s utilities provide a foundation for stable earnings, which translates to a stable currency in our stock.      

Generation s competitive businesses provide free cash flow to invest primarily into the utilities and in long-term, contracted assets.
              Exelon believes its strategy provides a
platform for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change.            Exelon s utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The Exelon utilities
only invest in rate base where it provides a net benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. The Exelon utilities make these investments prudently and at the lowest
reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. Additionally,

ComEd, PECO and BGE anticipate making significant future investments in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing
greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.            Generation s competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative solutions and reliable, clean and affordable energy. Generation s electricity generation strategy is to pursue
opportunities that provide generation to load matching to reduce earnings volatility. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation s customer facing activities foster
development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation
fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.
           Exelon s financial priorities are to maintain
investment grade credit metrics at each of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, to maintain optimal capital structure and to return value to Exelon s shareholders with an attractive dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and
through stable earnings growth. Exelon s Board of Directors approved a revised dividend policy. The approved policy would raise our dividend 2.5% each year for the next three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The Board will take
formal action to declare the next dividend in the second quarter.            Various market, financial, and other factors could affect the Registrants  success in pursuing their strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions
to these issues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information regarding market and financial factors.         
  Continually optimizing the cost structure is a key component of Exelon s financial strategy. Through a recent focused cost management
program the company has committed to reducing operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs by $350 million, of which approximately 35% of run-rate savings are expected to be achieved by the end of 2016 and fully realized in
2018. Savings will be allocated approximately 75%, 14%, 6% and 6% to Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. Exelon anticipates the earnings per share savings impact on EPS will be within $0.13 to $0.18 from 2018 forward.
             Proposed Merger with Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon)
             On April 29, 2014, Exelon and Pepco Holdings,
Inc. (PHI) signed an agreement and plan of merger (as subsequently amended and restated as of July 18, 2014, the Merger Agreement) to combine the two companies in an all cash transaction. The resulting company will retain the Exelon name. Under
the Merger Agreement, PHI s shareholders will receive $27.25 of cash in exchange for each share of PHI common stock. Based on the outstanding shares of PHI s common stock as of December 31, 2015, PHI shareholders would receive $6.9
billion in total cash. In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Exelon entered into a subscription agreement under which it has purchased $180 million of a class of nonvoting, nonconvertible and nontransferable preferred securities of
PHI. The preferred securities are included in Other non-current assets on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet. PHI has the right to redeem the preferred securities at its option for the purchase price paid plus accrued dividends, if any.
           On November 2, 2015, Exelon and PHI each filed a new
Notification and Report Form with the DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) due to the expiration of the original filing. The HSR Act waiting period expired on December 2, 2015, and the HSR Act no longer
precludes completion of the merger.

   To date, the PHI stockholders, the Virginia State Corporation Commission, the New Jersey Board of
Public Utilities (NJBPU), the Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC), the Maryland Public Service Commission (MDPSC) and the FERC have approved the merger of PHI and Exelon. The Federal Communications Commission has also approved the transfer of
certain PHI communications licenses.            On February 11,
2015, the NJBPU approved the proposed merger and the previously filed settlement signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Atlantic City Electric (ACE), NJBPU staff, and the Independent Energy Coalition. The settlement provides a package of benefits to ACE
customers and the state of New Jersey. This package of benefits includes the establishment of customer rate credit programs, with an aggregate value of $62 million for ACE customers and energy efficiency programs that will provide savings for ACE
customers of $15 million. The March 6, 2015, order by the NJBPU approving the merger required that the consummation of the merger must take place no later than November 1, 2015 unless otherwise extended by the Board. On October 15,
2015, the NJBPU extended the November 1, 2015 date to June 30, 2016.            On February 13, 2015, Exelon and PHI announced that they had reached a settlement agreement in the proceeding before the DPSC to review the proposed merger. The settlement, which was amended on April 7,
2015, was signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Delmarva Power   Light Company (DPL), the DPSC Staff, the Delaware Public Advocate, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility,
the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition and the Clean Air Council. As part of this settlement, Exelon and PHI proposed a package of benefits to DPL customers and the state of Delaware including the establishment of customer rate credits of $40
million for DPL customers in Delaware, $2 million of funding for energy efficiency programs for DPL low income customers, and $2 million of funding for workforce development. On June 2, 2015, the DPSC issued an order accepting the settlement
and approving the merger between Exelon and PHI.            On
March 17, 2015, Exelon and PHI announced that they had reached settlements with multiple parties in the Maryland proceeding to review the proposed merger after filing a Request for Adoption of Settlements with the MDPSC. The settlements were
signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Montgomery County, Prince George s County, the National Consumer Law Center, National Housing Trust, the Maryland Affordable Housing Coalition, the Housing Association of Nonprofit Developers, and a consortium
of recreational trail advocacy organizations led by the Mid-Atlantic Off-Road Enthusiasts. Exelon and PHI also announced a settlement with The Alliance for Solar Choice. On May 15, 2015, the MDPSC approved the merger after modifying a number of
the conditions in the settlements, resulting in total rate credits of $66 million, funding for energy efficiency programs of $43.2 million, a Green Sustainability Fund of $14.4 million, 20 MWs of renewable generation development and increased
penalties related to reliability commitments. On May 18, 2015, Exelon and PHI accepted and committed to fulfill the conditions.         
  On June 11, 2015, the Maryland Office of People s Counsel (OPC), the Sierra Club, and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network filed
Petitions for Judicial Review of the MDPSC s approval of the merger with the Circuit Court for Queen Anne s County. On June 23, 2015, Public Citizen, Inc. filed its Petition for Judicial Review with the Circuit Court for Queen
Anne s County. On July 10, 2015, Exelon and PHI filed a response in opposition to the Petitions for Review.         
  On July 21, 2015, the OPC filed a motion to stay the MDPSC order approving the merger and to set a schedule for discovery and presentation of
new evidence. On July 29, 2015, Public Citizen, Inc. filed a response supporting OPC s motion to stay, and on July 31, 2015 the Sierra Club and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network filed a joint motion to stay. In July and August,
Exelon, PHI, the MDPSC, Prince George s County and Montgomery County filed responses opposing the motions to stay. The judge issued an order denying the motions for stay on August 12, 2015. On January 8, 2016, the Circuit Court judge
affirmed the MDPSC s order approving the merger and denied the petitions for   
         84

judicial review filed by the OPC, the Sierra Club, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) and Public Citizen, Inc. On January 19, 2016, the OPC filed a notice of appeal to the Maryland
Court of Special appeals, and on January 21, Sierra Club and CCAN filed a notice of appeal. In the ordinary course this appeal would be resolved no earlier than third quarter 2016.            On August 27, 2015, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) issued an Opinion and Order denying
approval of the merger, concluding that the merger as presented was not in the public interest. Exelon and PHI filed an Application for Reconsideration with the DCPSC on September 28, 2015. On October 6, 2015, Exelon, PHI, the District of
Columbia Government, the Office of Peoples Counsel, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, the National Consumer Law Center, National Housing Trust and National Housing Trust Enterprise Preservation Corporation, and the Apartment
and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington (collectively, Settling Parties) entered into a Nonunanimous Full Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (Settlement Agreement) with respect to the merger. Exelon and PHI subsequently filed a
motion of joint applicants requesting the DCPSC to reopen the approval application to allow for consideration of the Settlement Agreement and granting additional requested relief. The new package of benefits totals $78 million and includes
commitments to provide relief of residential customer base rate increases of $26 million, one-time direct bill credits of $14 million, low-income energy assistance of $16 million, improved reliability, a cleaner and greener D.C. through funding
energy efficiency programs and development of renewable energy, and investment in local jobs and the local economy through workforce development of $5 million. It also guarantees charitable contributions totaling $19 million over 10 years.
           On October 28, 2015, the DCPSC agreed to reopen the
approval application to allow for consideration of the Settlement Agreement. Since then, parties supporting and opposing the Settlement filed testimony, participated in formal hearings and, on December 23, 2015, submitted final briefs to the
DCPSC. The parties now await a formal decision from the DCPSC. The Merger Agreement provides that either Exelon or PHI may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not completed by October 28, 2015. Pursuant to a Letter Agreement related
to the Settlement Agreement, Exelon and PHI have agreed, among other things, that they will not exercise their rights to terminate the Merger Agreement before March 4, 2016, except under limited circumstances. If the DCPSC does not approve the
Settlement Agreement by March 4, 2016, either Exelon or PHI may terminate the Settlement Agreement.         
  The settlements reached and commission orders received to date in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey include a  most favored nation 
provision which, generally speaking, requires allocation of merger benefits proportionately across all the jurisdictions. When applying the most favored nation provision to the settlement terms and other conditions established in the merger
approvals received to date, and as proposed in the Settlement Agreement filed with the DCPSC, Exelon and PHI currently estimate direct benefits of $430 million or more on a net present value basis (excluding charitable contributions and renewable
generation commitments) will be provided, including rate credits, funding for energy efficiency programs and other required commitments. Exelon and PHI anticipate substantially all of such amounts will be charged to earnings at the time of merger
close and will be paid by the end of 2017. An additional $53 million will be charged to earnings for charitable contributions, which are required to be paid over a period of 10 years. Commitments to develop renewable generation, which are expected
to be primarily capital in nature, will be recognized as incurred. Upon completion of the merger, the actual nature, amount, timing and financial reporting treatment for these commitments may be materially different from the current projection.
           Exelon has been named in suits filed in the Delaware
Chancery Court alleging that individual directors of PHI breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the proposed merger transaction and Exelon aided and abetted the individual directors  breaches. The suits seek to enjoin PHI from
completing the merger or seek rescission of the merger if completed. In addition, they also seek unspecified damages and costs. Exelon was also named in a federal court suit making similar claims. In September 2014, the parties reached a proposed
settlement that would resolve all claims, which is   
         85   

Table of Contents  

subject to court approval. Final court approval of the proposed settlement is not anticipated until approximately 90 days after merger close. Exelon does not believe these suits will impact the
completion of the transaction, and they are not expected to have a material impact on Exelon s results of operations.         
  Including 2014 and through December 31, 2015, Exelon has incurred approximately $259 million of expense associated with the proposed merger. Of
the total costs incurred, $121 million is primarily related to acquisition and integration costs and $138 million are for costs incurred to finance the transaction. The financing costs include $22 million of costs associated with the private
exchange offer and redemption of certain Senior Unsecured Notes (see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the exchange), as well as, a net loss of $64
million related to the settlement of forward-starting interest-rate swaps. These swaps were terminated in connection with the $4.2 billion issuance of debt; refer to Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The financing costs exclude costs to issue equity and the initial debt offering which we recorded to Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
        Under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, PHI
may be required to pay Exelon a termination fee ranging from $259 million to $293 million plus certain expenses. If the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval, Exelon may be required to pay PHI a
termination fee equal to $180 million through the redemption by PHI of the outstanding nonvoting preferred securities described above for no consideration other than the nominal par value of the stock, plus reimbursement of PHI s documented
out-of-pocket expenses up to a maximum of $40 million.              Merger
Financing              Exelon has raised cash to fund the
all-cash purchase price, acquisition and integration related costs, and merger commitments, through the issuance of $4.2 billion of debt (of which $3.3 billion remains after execution of the exchange offer, see Note 14 Debt and Credit
Agreements for further information on the exchange), $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity units, the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock, cash proceeds of $1.8 billion from asset sales primarily at
Generation (after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion) and the remaining balance from cash on hand and/or short-term borrowings available to Exelon. Exelon will have sufficient cash to fund the all-cash purchase price, acquisition and
integration related costs, and merger commitments. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 19 Shareholder s Equity of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt and equity
issuances.            Exelon has listed various potential risks
relating to the pending merger with PHI (see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS), including difficulties that may be encountered in satisfying the conditions to completion of the merger and the potential for developments that might have an adverse effect on
Exelon and the ability to realize the expected benefits of the merger. Exelon is taking steps to manage these risks and expects that the merger can be completed on a basis favorable to the company s shareholders and customers. Refer to Note
4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the merger transaction.         
    Implications of Potential Early Plant Retirements           
  Exelon and Generation continue to evaluate the current and expected economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will
continue to affect the economic value of Generation s nuclear plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative solutions in New York and Illinois such as the proposed Low Carbon
Portfolio Standard (LCPS) legislation, the impact of final rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of the states to implement those final rules, and the outcome of the Ginna RSSA hearing and settlement
procedures and the resulting contractual terms and conditions.   
         86

On September 10, 2015, after considering the results of the recent PJM capacity auctions, Exelon and Generation decided to defer decisions about the future operations of its Quad Cities and
Byron nuclear plants and will offer both plants in the 2019/2020 auction in May 2016. As a result of clearing the other PJM capacity auction in September 2015 for the 2017/2018 transitional capacity auction, Exelon and Generation will continue to
operate its Quad Cities nuclear power plant through at least May 2018. The Byron plant is already obligated to operate through May 2019. On October 29, 2015, Exelon and Generation announced the deferral of any decision about the future
operations of its Clinton nuclear plant and plans to bid the plant into the MISO capacity auction for the 2016-2017 planning year April 2016. This decision was driven by MISO s acknowledgment of the need for market design changes to ensure
long-term power system reliability in southern Illinois, the desire to provide Illinois policy makers with additional time to consider needed reforms as well as the potential long-term impact of EPA s Clean Power Plan. Exelon and Generation
previously committed to cease operation of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant by the end of 2019. Exelon and Generation have not made any decisions regarding potential nuclear plant closures at other sites at this time.   
        As a result of a decision to early retire one or more other nuclear
plants, certain changes in accounting treatment would be triggered and Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by a number of items including, among other items: accelerated depreciation
expense, impairment charges related to inventory that cannot be used at other nuclear units and cancellation of in-flight capital projects, accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel costs, employee-related costs (i.e. severance,
relocation, retention, etc.), accelerated asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activities, and additional funding of nuclear decommissioning trust funds. In addition, any early plant retirement would also result in
reduced operating costs, lower fuel expense, and lower capital expenditures in the periods beyond shutdown. While there are a number of Generation s nuclear plants that are at risk of early retirement, the following table provides the balance
sheet amounts as of December 31, 2015 for significant assets and liabilities associated with the three nuclear plants currently considered by management to be at the greatest risk of early retirement due to their current economic valuations and
other factors:         

(a)  
  Assumes Clinton seeks and receives a 20-year operating license renewal extension.     
        In the event a decision is made to retire early one or more nuclear
plants, the precise timing of the retirement date, and resulting financial statement impact, is uncertain and would be influenced by a number of factors such as the results of any transmission system reliability study assessments, the nature of any
co-owner requirements and stipulations, and decommissioning trust fund requirements, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does not have capacity obligations and
just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage date in that year.            NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility. These NRC
minimum funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC   
         87   

Table of Contents  

minimum funding test, then Generation would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional cash
contributions to the NDTF to ensure sufficient funds are available.            As of December 31, 2015, all three of Generation s plants at the highest risk of early retirement (Quad Cities, Clinton, and Ginna) pass the NRC minimum funding test based on their current license lives.
See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information on NRC minimum funding requirements. However, in the event of an early retirement just before their next individual refueling outages, it is estimated that Clinton and Ginna
would no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDTF investments could appreciate in value. Quad Cities would also be at risk. However,
the size of the guarantees are ultimately dependent on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site (i.e., DECON, Delayed DECON and SAFSTOR), the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going
forward. Considering the three alternative decommissioning approaches available to Generation for each site, parental guarantees of up to $315 million, $260 million, and $65 million for Clinton, Ginna, and Quad Cities, respectively, could be
required in order for each site to access its NDTF for radiological decommissioning costs.            In addition, upon issuance of any required financial guarantees, while all three sites would be able to utilize their respective decommissioning trust funds for radiological decommissioning costs, the NRC must
approve an additional exemption in order for Generation to utilize the NDTF funds to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e. spent fuel management and site restoration costs). If a unit does not receive this exemption, the costs would
be borne by Generation. Accordingly, based on current projections, it is expected that some portion of the spent fuel management and/or site restoration costs would need to be funded through supplemental cash from Generation. While the ultimate
amounts may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenarios and/or reimbursement of certain costs under DOE reimbursement agreements or future litigation, across the three alternative decommissioning approaches available to
Generation, for the next 10 years, Clinton and Ginna could incur spent fuel management and site restoration costs of up to $165 million and $115 million, net of taxes, respectively. The costs associated with Ginna would be shared by the plant
co-owners at their respective ownership percentages. If Quad Cities fails the exemption test, at its ownership percentage Generation could be required to pay for spent fuel management costs of up to $180 million, net of taxes, but Quad Cities is
better positioned to pass the test than the other two plants.              Power
Markets                Price of Fuels.   The use of
new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in
Exelon s revenues. Forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).   
          Capacity Market Changes in PJM.   In the wake of the
January 2014 Polar Vortex that blanketed much of the Eastern and Midwestern United States, it became clear that while a major outage event was narrowly avoided, resources in PJM were not providing the level of reliability expected by customers. As a
result, on December 12, 2014, PJM filed at FERC a proposal to make significant changes to its current capacity market construct, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM). PJM s proposed changes generally sought to improve resource performance
and reliability largely by limiting the excuses for non-performance and by increasing the penalties for performance failures. The proposal permits suppliers to include in capacity market offers additional costs and risk so they can meet these higher
performance requirements. While offers are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing prices, operational improvements made as a result of PJM s proposal are expected to improve
  
         88   

Table of Contents  

reliability, to reduce energy production costs as a result of more efficient operations and to reduce the need for out of market energy payments to suppliers. Generation participated actively in
PJM s stakeholder process through which PJM developed the proposal and also actively participated in the FERC proceeding including filing comments. On June 9, 2015, FERC approved PJM s filing largely as proposed by PJM, including
transitional auction rules for delivery years 2016/2017 through 2017/2018. As a result of this and several related orders, PJM hosted its 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction (results posted on August 21, 2015) and its transitional auction for
delivery year 2016/2017 (results posted on August 31, 2015) and its transitional auction for delivery years 2017/2018 (results posted on September 9, 2015).   
          MISO Capacity Market Results.   On April 14, 2015, the
Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) released the results of its capacity auction covering the June 2015 through May 2016 delivery year. As a result of the auction, capacity prices for the zone 4 region in downstate Illinois increased to
$150 per MW per day beginning in June 2015, an increase from the prior pricing of $16.75 per MW per day that was in effect from June 2014 to May 2015. Generation had an offer that was selected in the auction. However, due to Generation s
ratable hedging strategy, the results of the capacity auction have not had a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s consolidated results of operations and cash flows.            Additionally, in late May and June 2015, separate complaints were filed at the FERC by each of the State of Illinois, the
Southwest Electric Cooperative, Public Citizens, Inc., and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers challenging the results of this MISO capacity auction for the 2015/2016 delivery in MISO delivery zone 4. The complaints allege generally that 1) the
results of the capacity auction for zone 4 are not just and reasonable, 2) the results should be suspended, set for hearing and replaced with a new just and reasonable rate, 3) a refund date should be established and that 4) certain alleged behavior
by one of the market participants other than Exelon or Generation, be investigated.            On October 1, 2015, the FERC announced that it was conducting a non-public investigation (that does not involve Exelon or Generation) into whether market manipulation or other potential violations occurred
related to the auction. On December 31, 2015, the FERC issued a decision that certain of the rules governing the establishment of capacity prices in downstate Illinois are  not just and reasonable  on a prospective basis. The FERC
ordered that certain rules must be changed for the next auction scheduled for April 2016 that will set capacity prices beginning June 1, 2016. In response to this order, MISO must file certain rule changes with the FERC within 30 days and
certain other changes within 90 days. The FERC continues to conduct its non-public investigation to determine if the April 2015 auction results were manipulated and, if so, whether refunds are appropriate. The FERC did establish May 28, 2015,
the day the first complaint was filed, as the date from which refunds (if ordered) would be calculated, and it also made clear that the findings in the December 31, 2015 order do not prejudge the investigation or related proceedings. Generation
cannot predict the impact the FERC order may ultimately have on future auction results, capacity pricing or decisions related to the potential early retirement of the Clinton nuclear plant, however, such impacts could be material to
Generation s future results of operations and cash flows. See Note 9 Implications of Potential Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impacts of the MISO
announcement.            MISO has acknowledged the need for capacity
market design changes in the zone 4 region and stated that reforms to its capacity market process may be required to drive future investment and that it plans to engage stakeholders to consider such reforms. The FERC has also encouraged such
efforts.              Subsidized Generation.   The rate of
expansion of subsidized generation, including low-carbon generation such as wind and solar energy, in the markets in which Generation s output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power prices, and in turn, Generation s results of
operations.   
         89   

Table of Contents  

   Various states have attempted to implement or propose legislation, regulations or other policies to
subsidize new generation development which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity prices. For example, the New Jersey legislature enacted into law in January 2011, the Long Term Capacity Pilot Program Act (LCAPP). LCAPP
provides eligible generators with 15-year fixed contracts for the sale of capacity in the PJM capacity market. Under LCAPP, the local utilities in New Jersey are required to pay (or receive) the difference between the price eligible generators
receive in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the 15-year contract. New Jersey ultimately selected three proposals to participate in LCAPP and build new generation in the state. In addition, on April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued
an order directing the Maryland electric utilities to enter into a 20-year contract for differences (CfD) with CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), under which CPV will construct an approximately 700 MW combined cycle gas turbine in Waldorf, Maryland, that it
projected would be in commercial operation by June 1, 2015. CPV subsequently sought to extend that date. The CfD mandated that utilities (including BGE) pay (or receive) the difference between CPV s contract price and the revenues it
receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the PJM capacity market.            Exelon and others challenged the constitutionality and other aspects of the New Jersey legislation in federal court. The actions taken by the MDPSC were also challenged in federal court in an action to which Exelon
was not a party. The federal trial courts in both the New Jersey and Maryland actions effectively invalidated the actions taken by the New Jersey legislature and the MDPSC, respectively. Each of those decisions was upheld by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, respectively. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the matter, and there is risk the Supreme Court will overrule the lower courts.   
        As required under their contracts, generator developers who were
selected in the New Jersey and Maryland programs (including CPV) offered and cleared in PJM s capacity market auctions. To the extent that the state-required customer subsidies are included under their respective contracts, Exelon believes that
these projects may have artificially suppressed capacity prices in PJM in these auctions and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of Exelon s market driven position. While the court decisions in New Jersey and Maryland are
positive developments, continuation of these state efforts, if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule (MOPR) for future capacity auctions, could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and/or energy
prices. Other states could seek to establish programs, which could substantially impact Exelon s market driven position and could have a significant effect on Exelon s financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
           One such state is Ohio, where state-regulated utility
companies FirstEnergy Ohio (FE) and AEP Ohio (AEP) have initiated actions at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to obtain approval for Riders that would effectively allow these two companies to pass through to all customers in their
service territories the differences between their costs and market revenues on PPAs entered into between the utility and its merchant generation affiliate. Collectively more than 6,000MW of primarily coal-fired generation owned by FE and AEP s
affiliates seek ratepayer guaranteed subsidies via the proposed Riders. Thus, the Riders are similar to the CfDs described above (except that the PPA Riders in Ohio would apply to certain existing generation facilities whereas the CfDs applied to
new generation facilities). While AEP and FE initially filed for these Riders in 2013 and 2014, respectively, it was not until late 2015 that the proposals obtained meaningful traction when PUCO staff entered into a settlement and stipulation with
the Ohio utilities supporting the proposals and recommending that the PUCO approve the Riders. Exelon is a participant in these proceedings. Although the matter is still in hearing and a decision by the PUCO is not expected until late February/early
March 2016, it is increasingly likely that these subsidies may be approved by the PUCO. Litigation around these approvals is also likely.         
  Exelon opposes the proposals in Ohio, continues to monitor developments in Maryland and New Jersey, and participates in stakeholder and other
processes to ensure that similar state subsidies are   
         90

not developed. Exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, while opposing policies that require taxpayers and/ or consumers to subsidize or give preferential treatment to
generation providers or technologies that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefits, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid.              Energy Demand.   Modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives is resulting in
positive growth for electricity for BGE and PECO; and a decrease in projected load for electricity for ComEd. BGE, PECO and ComEd are projecting load volumes to increase (decrease) by 1.5%, 0.4% and (0.3)%, respectively, in 2016 compared 2015.
             Retail Competition.   Generation s retail
operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. The market experienced high price volatility in the first quarter of 2014 which contributed to
bankruptcies and consolidations within the industry during the year. However, forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that
wholesale generators (including Generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.         
    Strategic Policy Alignment           
  Exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and
credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of
hypothetical credit downgrades.            Exelon s board of
directors declared first, second, third and fourth quarter 2015 and first quarter 2016 dividends of $0.31 per share each on Exelon s common stock. The dividends for the first, second, third and fourth quarter 2015 were paid on March 10,
2015, June 10, 2015, September 10, 2015 and December 10, 2015. The first quarter 2016 dividend is payable on March 10, 2016.         
  All future quarterly dividends require approval by Exelon s board of directors. Exelon s Board of Directors approved a revised dividend
policy. The approved policy would raise our dividend 2.5% each year for the next three years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The Board will take formal action to declare the next dividend in the second quarter.   
          Hedging Strategy     
        Exelon s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over
three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into non-derivative and
derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. Generation has hedges in
place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2015 and 2016. However, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently
unhedged. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 90%-93%, 60%-63% and 28%-31% for 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount
of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes
assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel,   
         91   

Table of Contents  

load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, such as wholesale and retail sales of power, options and swaps. Generation has been and will continue to be
proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk in subsequent years as well.            Generation procures oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts,
contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject
to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or
service at the contracted prices. Approximately 50% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2016 through 2020 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that
replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on
Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.            ComEd, PECO and BGE mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.              Growth Opportunities           
  Management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon s businesses, assets and markets, leveraging Exelon s expertise
in those areas and offering sustainable returns.             Regulated Energy
Businesses             The proposed merger with PHI provides an
opportunity to accelerate Exelon s regulated growth to provide stable cash flows, earnings accretion, and dividend support. Additionally, ComEd, PECO and BGE anticipate investing approximately $18 billion over the next five years in electric
and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart meter and smart grid initiatives, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to
current rate base of approximately $8 billion by the end of 2020. ComEd, PECO and BGE invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. These
investments are made prudently and at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.            See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Initiatives and infrastructure development and enhancement
programs.             Competitive Energy Businesses    
        Generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition
of our generation assets as well as explores wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. Generation s long-term growth strategy is to prioritize investments in long-term contracted generation across multiple
technologies and identify and capitalize on opportunities that provide generation to load matching as a means to provide stable earnings, while identifying emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future
growth or influence in market development. As of December 31, 2015, Generation has currently approved plans to invest a total of approximately $2 billion in 2016 through 2018 on capital growth projects (primarily new plant construction and
distributed generation).

  Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment
grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing
options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). The Registrants expect
cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.         
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5 billion, $5.3

  See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
          Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Developments.     
        Exelon is actively involved in the EPA s development and
implementation of environmental regulations for the electric industry, in pursuit of its business strategy to provide reliable, clean, affordable and innovative energy products. These efforts have most frequently involved air, water and waste
controls for electric generating units, as set forth in the discussion below. These regulations have a disproportionate adverse impact on fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance
expense, and have resulted in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. Retirements of coal-fired power plants will continue as additional EPA regulations take effect, and as air quality standards are updated and further restrict emissions. Due
to its low emission generation portfolio, Generation will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. Various bills
have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would prohibit or impede the EPA s rulemaking efforts, and it is uncertain whether any of these bills will become law.   
          Air Quality.   In recent years, the EPA has been
implementing a series of increasingly stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act applicable to electric generating units. These regulations have resulted in more stringent emissions limits on fossil-fuel electric generating stations as states
implement their compliance plans.             National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS).  The EPA continues to review and update its NAAQS for conventional air pollutants relating to ground-level ozone and emissions of particulate   
         93   

Table of Contents  

matter, SO2 and NOx. Following five years of litigation, the EPA is finalizing the Cross State Air Pollution Rule that requires 28 upwind states in the eastern half of the United States to
significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in downwind states.   
         Mercury and Air Toxics Standard Rule (MATS).  On
December 16, 2011, the EPA signed a final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the NSPS for electric generating units. The final rule, known as MATS, requires coal-fired electric generation
plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals, and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses. The initial compliance deadline to meet the new standards was
April 16, 2015; however, facilities may have been granted an additional one or two year extension in limited cases. Numerous entities challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon intervened in support of the rule. In April 2014, the
D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion upholding MATS in its entirety. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2015 that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate
hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, did not vacate the rule; rather, it was remanded to the D.C. Circuit Court to take further action consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s opinion on this
single issue. As such, the MATS rule remains in effect. Exelon will continue to participate in the remanded proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court as an intervenor in support of the rule.             Climate Change.  Exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade
program for GHG emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions. In the absence of Federal legislation, the EPA is moving forward with the regulation of GHG
emissions under the Clean Air Act. In addition, there have been recent developments in the international regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC  of
 Convention ). See ITEM 1. BUSINESS, Global Climate Change  for further discussion.         
    Water Quality.   Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants
reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the
regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing regulations. Those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Ginna,
Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Riverside, Salem and Schuylkill. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS , Water Quality  for further discussion.   
          Solid and Hazardous Waste.   In October 2015, the first
federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants became effective. The rule classifies CCR as non-hazardous waste under RCRA. Under the regulation, CCR will continue to be regulated by most states subject to
coordination with the federal regulations. Generation has previously recorded reserves consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the regulation is not expected to impact Exelon s and Generation s financial
results. Generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted under the new federal regulations for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by
Generation. For these reasons, Generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent it may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations.

   See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.              Other Regulatory and Legislative Actions                NRC Task Force Insights from the Fukushima Daiichi Accident (Exelon and Generation).   In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011, 9.0 magnitude earthquake and
ensuing tsunami, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, issued a report of its review of the accident, including tiered recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near
and longer term. The Task Force s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and its staff have issued orders and implementation
guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. Generation has assessed the impacts of the Tier 1 orders and information requests and will continue
monitoring the additional recommendations under review by the NRC staff, both from an operational and a financial impact standpoint. A comprehensive review of the NRC Tier 1 orders and information requests, as well as preliminary engineering
assumptions and analysis, indicate that the financial impact of compliance for Generation, net of expected co-owner reimbursements, for the period from 2016 through 2019 is expected to be between approximately $175 million and $200 million of
capital (which includes approximately $25 million for the CENG plants) and $25 million of operating expense (which includes approximately $5 million for the CENG plants). Generation s current assessments are specific to the Tier 1
recommendations as the NRC has not taken specific action with respect to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations. Exelon and Generation are unable to conclude at this time to what extent any actions to comply with the requirements of Tier 2 and Tier 3
will impact their future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Generation will continue to engage in nuclear industry assessments and actions and stakeholder input. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information.
             Financial Reform Legislation (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO, and BGE).   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was enacted in July 2010. The part of the Act that applies to Exelon is Title VII, which is known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Transparency and
Accountability Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank requires the creation of a new regulatory regime for over-the-counter swaps (Swaps), including mandatory clearing for certain categories of Swaps, incentives to shift Swap activity to exchange trading,
margin and capital requirements, and other obligations designed to promote transparency. For non security-based Swaps including commodity Swaps, Dodd-Frank empowers the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to promulgate regulations
implementing the law s objectives. The primary aim of Dodd-Frank is to regulate the key intermediaries in the Swaps market, which entities are either swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), and certain other financial entities, but
the law also applies to a lesser degree to end-users of Swaps. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that exempts from margin requirements Swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. Moreover, the
CFTC s Dodd-Frank regulations preserve the ability of end users in the energy industry to hedge their risks using Swaps without being subject to mandatory clearing, and excepts or exempts end-users from many of the other substantive
regulations. Accordingly, as an end-user, Generation is conducting its commercial business in a manner that does not require registration with the CFTC as an SD or MSP. Generation does not anticipate transacting in the future in a manner in which it
would become a SD or MSP.            There are, however, some rules,
including the capital and margin rules for (non-cleared) Swaps that do not impact Generation s collateral requirements directly, but may have an indirect impact.   
         95   

Table of Contents  

These rules, in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development and that are similar to Dodd-Frank, could subject Generation s SD or MSP counterparties to
additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements and could motivate the SDs and MSPs to increase collateral requirements or cash postings from their counterparties, including Generation.   
        Generation cannot predict to what extent, if any, further refinements
to Dodd-Frank and international regulatory requirements relating to Swaps may impact its cash flows or financial position, but such impacts could be material.         
  ComEd, PECO and BGE could also be subject to some Dodd-Frank requirements to the extent they were to enter into Swaps. However, at this time,
management of ComEd, PECO and BGE continue to expect that their companies will not be materially affected by Dodd-Frank.         
    Market-Based Rates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).   Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are public utilities for purposes of the
Federal Power Act and are required to obtain FERC s acceptance of rate schedules for wholesale electricity sales. Currently, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have authority to execute wholesale electricity sales at market-based rates. As is
customary with market-based rate schedules, FERC has reserved the right to suspend market-based rate authority on a retroactive basis if it subsequently determines that Generation, ComEd, PECO or BGE has violated the terms and conditions of its
tariff or the Federal Power Act. FERC is also authorized to order refunds in certain instances if it finds that the market-based rates are not just and reasonable under the Federal Power Act.            As required by FERC s regulations, as promulgated in the Order No. 697 series, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE
file market power analyses using the prescribed market share screens to demonstrate that Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE qualify for market-based rates in the regions where they are selling energy, capacity, and ancillary services under market-based
rate tariffs. On December 30, 2013, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE filed its updated analysis for the Northeast Region, based on 2012 historic test period data which the FERC accepted on August 5, 2014. On December 23, 2014,
Generation filed its updated market power analysis for the Southeast Region which the FERC accepted on July 16, 2015. On December 23, 2014, Generation filed its updated market power analysis for the Central Region which the FERC accepted
on November 25, 2015. On December 29, 2015, Generation filed its updated market power analysis for the SPP Region, and the FERC has not yet acted on the filing.   
          Illinois Low Carbon Portfolio Standard (Exelon, Generation and
ComEd).   In March 2015, the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard (LCPS) was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly. The legislation would require ComEd and Ameren to purchase low carbon energy credits to match 70 percent of the electricity used
on the distribution system. The LCPS is a technology-neutral solution, so all generators of zero or low carbon energy would be able to compete in the procurement process, including wind, solar, hydro, clean coal and nuclear. Costs associated with
purchasing the low carbon energy credits would be collected from customers. The LCPS proposal includes consumer protection such as a price cap that would limit the impact to a 2.015% increase based off 2009 monthly bills, or about $2 per month for
the average residential electricity customer. The legislation also includes a separate customer rebate provision that would provide a direct bill credit to customers in the event wholesale prices exceed a specified level. The proposed legislation is
pending and Exelon and Generation continue to work with stakeholders.              Legislation to Maximize Smart Grid Investments and to Promote a Cleaner and Greener Illinois (Exelon and ComEd).   In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly that would
(1) build on ComEd s investment in the Smart Grid to reinforce the resiliency and security of the electrical grid to withstand unexpected challenges, (2) expand energy efficiency
  
         96

programs to reduce energy waste and increase customer savings, (3) further integrate clean renewable energy onto the power system, and (4) introduce a new demand-based rate design for
residential customers that would allow for a more equitable sharing of smart grid costs among customers. The legislation also provides for additional funding for customer assistance programs for low-income customers. The proposed legislation is
pending and ComEd continues to work with stakeholders.         
    Distribution Formula Rate Update Filing (Exelon and ComEd).   On April 15, 2015, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate
to request a total decrease to the revenue requirement of $50 million. On December 9, 2015, the ICC issued its final order which decreased the revenue requirement by $67 million, reflecting an increase of $85 million for the initial revenue
requirement for 2015 and a decrease of $152 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2014. The rates took effect in January 2016. Intervenors requested a rehearing on specific issues. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to distribution formula updates.         
    2015 Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and PECO).   On March 27, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC
requesting an increase of $190 million to its annual service revenues for electric delivery, which requested an ROE of 10.95%. On September 10, 2015, PECO and interested parties filed with the PAPUC a petition for joint settlement for an
increase of $127 million in annual distribution service revenue. No overall ROE was specified in the settlement. On December 17, 2015, the PAPUC approved the settlement of PECO s electric distribution rate case. The approved electric
delivery rates became effective on January 1, 2016.         
  The settlement includes approval of the In-Program Arrearage Forgiveness ( IPAF ) Program, which provides for forgiveness of a portion of
the eligible arrearage balance of its low-income Customer Assistance Program (CAP) accounts receivable that will be determined as of program inception in October 2016. The forgiveness will be granted to the extent CAP customers remain current with
payments. The Settlement guarantees PECO s recovery of two-thirds of the arrearage balance through a combination of customer payments and rate recovery, including through future rates cases if necessary. The remaining one-third of the arrearage
balance will be absorbed by PECO, of which a portion has already been expensed as bad debt for CAP customer s accounts receivable balances.         
  Although the actual arrearage balance is not defined until program inception, PECO believes that it can reasonably estimate certain CAP customer
accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2015 that will remain outstanding at program inception. Management determined its best estimate based on historical collectability information. As a result, a regulatory asset of $7 million,
representing the previously incurred bad debt expense associated with the estimated eligible accounts receivable balances, was recorded on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. This estimate will be
revisited on a quarterly basis through program inception.         
    PECO Gas Main Extension Program (Exelon and PECO).   On November 6, 2014, PECO filed a plan with the PAPUC requesting approval of
three initiatives to provide more incentives to customers interested in switching to natural gas service. On October 1, 2015, the PAPUC approved the PECO Gas Main Extension Program, without modification. This approval allows local customers to
pay significantly less initially to have natural gas installed at their homes and businesses.              2015 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).   On November 6, 2015, and as amended on January 5, 2016, BGE filed for electric and gas base rate increases with the
MDPSC, ultimately requesting an increase of $121 million and $79 million, respectively, of which $103 million and $37 million, respectively, is related to recovery of smart grid initiative costs. BGE requested a ROE for the electric and gas
distribution rate case of 10.6% and 10.5%, respectively. The new   
         97   

Table of Contents  

electric and gas base rates are expected to take effect in June 2016. BGE is also proposing to recover an annual increase of approximately $30 million for Baltimore City conduit lease fees
through a surcharge. BGE cannot predict how much of the requested increase the MDPSC will approve or if it will approve BGE s request for a conduit fee surcharge.   
          Transmission Formula Rate Update Filing (Exelon, ComEd and BGE).
  On April 15, 2015 (and revised on May 19), ComEd filed its annual 2015 transmission formula rate update with the FERC, reflecting an increased revenue requirement of $86 million, including an increase of $68 million for the initial
revenue requirement and an increase of $18 million related to the annual reconciliation. The filing establishes the revenue requirement used to set rates that took effect in June 2015, subject to review by the FERC and other parties. The time period
for any challenges to ComEd s annual update expired in October 2015. No challenges were submitted. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to transmission
formula update.            In April 2015, BGE filed its annual
transmission formula rate update with the FERC, reflecting an increased revenue requirement of $10 million, including an increase of $13 million for the initial revenue requirement, inclusive of dedicated facilities charge revenues, and a decrease
of $3 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2014. The filing establishes the revenue requirement used to set rates that took effect in June 2015. The time period for any challenges to BGE s annual update expired in October 2015. No
challenges were submitted. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the transmission formula update.              Grand Prairie Gateway Transmission Line (Exelon and ComEd).   On December 2, 2013, ComEd filed a request
to obtain the ICC s approval to construct a 60-mile overhead 345kV transmission line that traverses Ogle, DeKalb, Kane and DuPage Counties in Northern Illinois. On May 28, 2014, in a separate proceeding, FERC issued an order granting
ComEd s request to include 100% of the capital costs recorded to construction work in progress during construction of the line in ComEd s transmission rate base. If the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond ComEd s
control, FERC approved the ability for ComEd to recover 100% of its prudent costs incurred after May 21, 2014 and 50% of its costs incurred prior to May 21, 2014 in ComEd s transmission rate base. The costs incurred for the project
prior to May 21, 2014 were immaterial. ComEd has acquired numerous easements across the project route through voluntary transactions. ComEd will seek to acquire the property rights on the remaining 28 parcels through condemnation proceedings in
the circuit courts. ComEd began construction of the line during the second quarter of 2015 with an in-service date expected in the second quarter of 2017.         
    FERC Ameren Order (Exelon and ComEd).   In July 2012, FERC issued an order to Ameren Corporation (Ameren) finding that Ameren had
improperly included acquisition premiums/goodwill in its transmission formula rate, particularly in its capital structure and in the application of AFUDC. FERC also directed Ameren to make refunds for the implied increase in rates in prior years.
Ameren filed for rehearing of the July 2012 order, which was denied in June 2014. On July 20, 2015, FERC approved a settlement between Ameren and its customers to resolve the matter. ComEd believes that the FERC settlement authorizing its
transmission formula rate is distinguishable from the circumstances that led to the July 2012 FERC order in the Ameren case. However, if ComEd were required to exclude acquisition premiums/goodwill from its transmission formula rate, the impact
could be material to ComEd s results of operations and cash flows.              FERC Order No. 1000 Compliance (ComEd, PECO and BGE).   In FERC Order No. 1000, the FERC required public utility transmission providers to enhance their transmission planning procedures and
their cost allocation methods applicable to certain new regional and interregional transmission   
         98

projects. As part of the changes to the transmission planning procedures, the FERC required removal from all FERC-approved tariffs and agreements of a right of first refusal to build certain new
transmission facilities. On October 25, 2012, certain of the PJM transmission owners, including ComEd, PECO and BGE (collectively, the PJM Transmission Owners), submitted a filing asserting that their contractual rights embodied in the PJM
governing documents continue to justify their right of first refusal to construct new reliability (and related) transmission projects and that the FERC should not be allowed to override such rights absent a showing that it is in the public interest
to do so under the FERC s   Mobile-Sierra   standard of review. This is a heightened standard of review which the PJM Transmission Owners argued could not be satisfied based on the facts applicable to them. On March 22,
2013, FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the arguments of the PJM Transmission Owners that changes to the PJM governing documents were entitled to review under the  Mobile-Sierra  standard. The FERC s March 22,
2013 order could enable third parties to seek to build certain regional transmission projects that had previously been reserved for the PJM Transmission Owners, potentially reducing ComEd PECO and BGE s financial return on new investments in
energy transmission facilities.            Numerous parties sought
rehearing of the FERC s March 22, 2013 order, including the PJM Transmission Owners. On May 15, 2014, FERC denied the PJM Transmission Owners rehearing request. Several parties filed an appeal of the FERC s May 15, 2014,
Order which upheld PJM s right of first refusal language in the D.C. Circuit. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted at this time, however, it could be material to Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE s results of operations
and cash flows.              FERC Transmission Complaint (Exelon
and BGE).   On February 27, 2013, consumer advocates and regulators from the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, and the Delaware Electric Municipal Cooperatives (the parties), filed a complaint at FERC against BGE
and the PHI companies relating to their respective transmission formula rates. BGE s formula rate includes a 10.8% base rate of return on common equity (ROE) and a 50 basis point incentive for participating in PJM (and certain additional
incentive basis points on certain projects). The parties sought a reduction in the base return on equity to 8.7% and changes to the formula rate process. Under FERC rules, any revenues subject to refund are limited to a fifteen month period and the
earliest date from which the base ROE could be adjusted and refunds required is the date of the complaint.         
  On August 21, 2014, FERC issued an order in the BGE and PHI companies  proceeding, which established hearing and settlement judge
procedures for the complaint, and set a refund effective date of February 27, 2013.            On December 8, 2014, various state agencies in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and D.C. filed a second complaint against BGE regarding the base ROE of the transmission business seeking a reduction from 10.8%
to 8.8%. The filing of the second complaint created a second refund window. By order issued on February 9, 2015, FERC established a hearing on the second complaint with the complainants  requested refund effective date of December 8,
2014. On February 20, 2015, the Chief Judge issued an order consolidating the two complaint proceedings and established an Initial Decision issuance deadline of February 29, 2016.            On November 6, 2015, BGE and the PHI companies and the complainants filed a settlement with FERC covering the issues
raised in the complaints. The settlement provides for a 10% base ROE, effective March 8, 2016, which will be augmented by the PJM incentive adder of 50 basis points, and refunds to BGE customers of $13.7 million. The settlement also provides a
moratorium on any change in the ROE until June 1, 2018. On December 16, 2015, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge submitted a Certification of the Uncontested Settlement to the FERC Commissioners. The settlement remains subject to FERC
approval. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

     The Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program (Exelon and
BGE).   In 2013, legislation intended to accelerate gas infrastructure replacements in Maryland was signed into law. The law established a mechanism, separate from base rate proceedings, for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and
prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects incurred after June 1, 2013. The monthly surcharge and infrastructure replacement costs must be approved by the MDPSC and are subject to a cap and require an annual true-up of the
surcharge revenues against actual expenditures. Investment levels in excess of the cap would be recoverable in a subsequent gas base rate proceeding at which time all costs for the infrastructure replacement projects would be rolled into gas
distribution rates. Irrespective of the cap, BGE is required to file a gas rate case every five years under this legislation.         
  On August 2, 2013, BGE filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. On January 29, 2014, the MDPSC issued a
decision conditionally approving the first five years of BGE s plan and surcharge. On November 16, 2015, BGE filed a surcharge update to be effective January 1, 2016, including a true-up of cost estimates included in the 2015
surcharge, along with its 2016 project list and projected capital estimates of $113 million to be included in the 2016 surcharge calculation. The MDPSC subsequently approved BGE s 2016 project list and the proposed surcharge for 2016, which
included the 2015 surcharge true-up. As of December 31, 2015, BGE recorded a regulatory asset of less than $1 million, representing the difference between the surcharge revenues and program costs.   
        In 2014, the residential consumer advocate in Maryland appealed
MDPSC s decision on BGE s infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge with the Baltimore City Circuit Court, who affirmed the MDPSC s decision. On October 10, 2014, the residential consumer advocate noticed its
appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals from the judgment entered by the Baltimore City Circuit Court. During the third quarter of 2015, the residential consumer advocate, MDPSC, and BGE filed briefs. Oral argument in this matter was held
before the Court of Special Appeals on November 3, 2015. On January 28, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued a decision affirming the MDPSC s decision. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
    PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule (Exelon and Generation).   PJM s capacity market rules include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) that
is intended to preclude sellers from artificially suppressing the competitive price signals for generation capacity. The FERC orders approving the MOPR were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in February 2014.
           Exelon continues to work with PJM stakeholders and through
the FERC process to implement several proposed changes to the PJM tariff aimed at ensuring that capacity resources (including those with state-sanctioned subsidy contracts and capacity market speculators) cannot inappropriately affect capacity
auction prices in PJM.               Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates             The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management
discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with its accounting and disclosure governance committee on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the Exelon board of directors. Management
believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of the application
of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)    
        Generation s ARO associated with decommissioning its nuclear
units was $8.2 billion at December 31, 2015. The authoritative guidance requires that Generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. To estimate that liability, Generation uses an
internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.         
  As a result of recent nuclear plant retirements in the industry, nuclear operators and third-party service providers are obtaining more information
about costs associated with decommissioning activities. At the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. In addition, as more nuclear
plants are retired, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. These factors could result in material changes to Generation s current estimates
as more information becomes available and could change the timing and probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.         
  The nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the
expected timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions described as follows:   
          Decommissioning Cost Studies.   Generation uses
unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the costs and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within its industry and other estimates.
Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates (such as a change in assumed operating life for a nuclear
plant). As part of the annual cost study update process, Generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the
updated estimates to the AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.         
    Cost Escalation Factors.   Generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost
studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and
materials, energy, LLRW disposal and other costs. All of the nuclear AROs are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factors.         
    Probabilistic Cash Flow Models.   Generation s probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various
scenarios for decommissioning cost levels, decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a unit-by-unit basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or
15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base cost scenario. Probabilities are also assigned to three different decommissioning approaches as follows:         

1.  
  DECON a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a facility and site containing radioactive
contaminants are removed and safely buried in a LLRW landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for unrestricted use,     

2.  
  Delayed DECON similar to the DECON scenario but with a delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities, or
    
         101   

Table of Contents  

3.  
  SAFSTOR a method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently
decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use generally within 60 years after cessation of operations.           
  The actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by Generation at the time of shutdown and may be
influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at the time of shutdown.         
  The assumed plant shutdown timing scenarios have historically included the following two alternatives: (1) the probability of operating through
the original 40-year nuclear license term, and (2) the probability of operating through an extended 60-year nuclear license term (regardless of whether such 20-year license extension had been received for each unit). During 2015, due to
changing market conditions and regulatory environments, Generation began to consider and incorporate assumptions regarding plant shutdown timing scenarios for certain plants other than just the two scenarios historically considered. In addition to
potential early shutdown scenarios, Generation also began in 2015 to incorporate into its ARO estimates some probability of a second, 20-year license renewal for some nuclear units. The successful operation of nuclear plants in the U.S. beyond the
initial 40-year license terms has prompted the NRC to consider regulatory and technical requirements for potential plant operations for an 80-year nuclear operating term. As power market and regulatory environment developments occur, Generation
evaluates and incorporates, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into its nuclear ARO assumptions and estimates.         
  Generation s probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal. Generation
currently assumes DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2025. The SNF acceptance date assumption was based on management s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for
long-term SNF storage. For more information regarding the estimated date that DOE will begin accepting SNF, see Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
          License Renewals.   Generation has received, has applied
for, or plans to seek, 20-year license renewals for all of its nuclear units. Generation has successfully secured 20-year operating license renewal extensions (i.e., extending the total license term to 60 years) for twenty-one of its nuclear units
(including the two Salem units co-owned by Generation, but operated by PSEG and Braidwood Units 1 and 2 for which the NRC approved the renewed license on January 27, 2016). None of Generation s previous applications for an operating
license extension has been denied. The 20-year license renewal for Oyster Creek nuclear unit was obtained in 2009, however, operations will cease by the end of 2019. For its remaining three operating units, Generation is in various stages of the
process of pursuing similar extensions and has filed license renewal applications for two operating nuclear units and has until 2021 to seek license renewal for one remaining operating nuclear unit. Generation s assumptions regarding successful
license extension for the remaining three operating units for ARO determination purposes is based in part on the good current physical condition and high performance of these nuclear units, the favorable status of the ongoing license renewal
proceedings with the NRC, and the successful renewals for twenty-one units to date.            Generation estimates that the failure to obtain initial license renewals to extend the operating life from 40 years to 60 years at any of its remaining nuclear units (assuming all other assumptions remain constant)
would increase its ARO on average approximately $300 million per unit as of December 31, 2015. The size of the increase to the ARO for a particular nuclear unit is dependent upon the current stage in its original license term and its specific
decommissioning cost estimates. If Generation does not receive license renewal on a particular unit, the increase to the ARO may be mitigated by Generation s ability to delay ultimate decommissioning activities under a SAFSTOR method of
decommissioning.   
         102

     Discount Rates.   The probability-weighted estimated future cash flows using these various
scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. The accounting guidance required Generation to establish an ARO at fair value at the
time of the initial adoption of the current accounting standard. Subsequent to the initial adoption, the ARO is adjusted for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions, as described
above. Increases in the ARO as a result of upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current CARFR as the increase creates a new cost layer within the ARO. Any decrease in the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the ARO are treated as a modification of an existing ARO and, therefore, are measured using the average historical CARFR rates used in creating the initial ARO cost layers.   
        Under the current accounting framework, the ARO is not required or
permitted to be re-measured for changes in the CARFR that occur in isolation. This differs from the accounting requirements for other long-dated obligations, such as pension and other post-employment benefits that are required to be re-measured as
and when corresponding discount rates change. If Generation s future nominal cash flows associated with the ARO were to be discounted at current prevailing CARFRs, the obligation would increase from approximately $8.2 billion to approximately
$8.5 billion. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the NDTs. The NDTs are recorded on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015 at fair value of approximately $10.3 billion and
have an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return of 6.1% to 6.3%.            To illustrate the significant impact that changes in the CARFR, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the ARO: i) had Generation used the
2014 CARFRs rather than the 2015 CARFRs in performing its third quarter 2015 ARO update, Generation would have increased the ARO by approximately $940 million as compared to the actual increase to the ARO of $831 million; and ii) if the CARFR used
in performing the third quarter 2015 ARO update (which also reflected increases in the amounts and changes to the timing of projected cash flows) was increased by 100 basis points or decreased by 50 basis points, the ARO would have increased by $100
million and $1.2 billion, respectively, as compared to the actual increase of $831 million.              ARO Sensitivities.   Changes in the assumptions underlying the foregoing items could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The impact to the ARO of a change in any one of these assumptions
is highly dependent on how the other assumptions will change as well.

         Goodwill (Exelon and ComEd)    
        As of December 31, 2015, Exelon s and ComEd s carrying
amount of goodwill was approximately $2.7 billion, relating to the acquisition of ComEd in 2000 as part of the PECO/Unicom Merger. Under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for goodwill, ComEd is required to perform an assessment for
possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the ComEd reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative
guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component
constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment for its combined business. There is no level below this
operating segment for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, ComEd s operating segment is considered its only reporting unit.   
        Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first
performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. In performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations,
overall financial performance, cost factors, and entity-specific events. If an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further
testing is required. If an entity bypasses the   
         104   

Table of Contents  

qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair
value-based test is performed. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second
step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining
the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth
rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s business and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step (if needed), management must estimate the fair value of specific
assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, Note 11 Intangible Assets and Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
            Purchase Accounting (Exelon and Generation)    
        In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if it exceeds the estimated fair value and as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if it is below the estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
requires management s judgment, often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices
and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability,
can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.             Unamortized Energy Assets and Liabilities
(Exelon and Generation)             Unamortized energy contract
assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that Generation has acquired. The initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contract at the time of acquisition, and the balance is
amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. Amortization expense and income are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues. Refer to Note 4 Mergers,
Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.         
   Impairment of Long-lived Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE regularly monitor and evaluate
their long-lived assets and asset groups, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment may include a deteriorating business climate,
including decline in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, among others.   
         105   

Table of Contents  

   The review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about
operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. For the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for
the sale of power, costs of fuel and the expected operations of assets. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could have a significant effect on
the consolidated financial statements. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets
and liabilities. For the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units
as well as the associated intangible assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. The cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk
management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with
a third party and operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables).         
  On a quarterly basis, Generation assesses its asset groups for indicators of impairment. If indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset
group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is
determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant s view of the
exit price of the assets. This includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates. Events and circumstances often do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences
between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, to the extent that any of the information used in the fair value analysis requires judgment, the resulting fair market value would be
different. As such, the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount
rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources. An impairment determination would require the affected Registrant to reduce the value of either the long-lived asset or asset group, including any associated
intangible assets or liabilities, as well as reduce the current period earnings by the amount of the impairment.         
  Generation evaluates natural gas and oil upstream properties on a quarterly basis to determine if they are impaired. Impairment indicators for
natural gas and oil upstream properties are present if there are no firm plans to continue drilling, lease expiration is at risk, historical experience indicates a decline in carrying value below fair value or the price of the underlying commodity
significantly declines.            Generation evaluates its equity
method investments and other investments in debt and equity securities to determine whether or not they are impaired based on whether the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature.   
        Exelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia subject to
long-term leases. The investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. The investments represent the estimated residual values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the
estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. Exelon estimates the
fair value of the residual values   
         106   

Table of Contents  

of its direct financing lease investments under the income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis, that takes into consideration significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including
the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to operate the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include fundamental energy and
capacity prices, fixed and variable costs, capital expenditure requirements, discount rates, tax rates, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the plants. The estimated fair values also reflect the cash flows associated with the service
contracts associated with the plants given that a market participant would take into consideration all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease agreements.   
        See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of asset impairment evaluations made by Exelon.             Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets.
Depreciation of these assets is generally provided over their estimated service lives on a straight-line basis using the composite method. The Registrants complete depreciation studies every five years, or more frequently if an event, regulatory
action, or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary. The estimation of service lives requires management judgment regarding the period of time that the assets will be in use. As circumstances warrant, the estimated service lives
are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed. Depreciation rates incorporate assumptions on interim retirements based on actual historical retirement experience. To the extent interim retirement patterns change, this could have a significant
impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. Changes to depreciation estimates resulting from a change in the estimated end of service lives could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense
recorded in the income statement. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of
the Registrants.            The estimated service lives of the nuclear
generating facilities are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year license renewal extension of the operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek.
While Generation has received license renewals for certain facilities, and has applied for or expects to apply for and obtain approval of license renewals for the remaining facilities, circumstances may arise that would prevent Generation from
obtaining additional license renewals. Generation also evaluates annually the estimated service lives of its generating facilities based on feasibility assessments as well as economic and capital requirements. The estimated service lives of
hydroelectric facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of the Conowingo and Muddy Run operating licenses. A change in depreciation estimates resulting from Generation s
extension or reduction of the estimated service lives could have a significant effect on Generation s results of operations.         
  Generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates
effective January 1, 2015.            ComEd is required to file a
depreciation rate study at least every five years with the ICC. ComEd completed a depreciation study and filed the updated depreciation rates with both FERC and the ICC in January 2014. This resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates
effective first quarter 2014.   
         107   

Table of Contents  

   PECO is required to file a depreciation rate study at least every five years with the PAPUC. In March
2015, PECO filed a depreciation rate study with the PAPUC for both its electric and gas assets, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015 for electric transmission assets, July 1, 2015 for gas
distribution assets and January 1, 2016 for electric distribution assets.            The MDPSC does not mandate the frequency or timing of BGE s depreciation studies. In July 2014, BGE filed revised depreciation rates with the MDPSC for both its electric distribution and gas assets. Revisions
to depreciation rates from this filing were finalized and effective December 15, 2014.             Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans for substantially all Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and
BSC employees. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
           The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of
providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required
assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan
participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and
upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in
the income statement. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. Pension and other
postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are ultimately allocated to projects within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.            Pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and international
securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and classification under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with authoritative guidance.   
          Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets.   The long-term
EROA assumption used in calculating pension costs was 7.00%, 7.00% and 7.50% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 6.46%, 6.59% and 6.45% in 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. The pension trust activity is non-taxable, while other postretirement benefit trust activity is partially taxable. The current year EROA is based on asset allocations from the prior year end. In 2010, Exelon began
implementation of a liability-driven investment strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Over time, Exelon has decreased its equity investments and increased its investments in
  
         108   

Table of Contents  

fixed income securities and alternative investments within the pension asset portfolio in order to achieve a balanced portfolio of liability hedging and return-generating assets. See Note
17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon s asset allocations. Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.71% to estimate its 2016 pension and other postretirement
benefit costs, respectively.            Exelon calculates the expected
return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In
determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years.
For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to
be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For other postretirement benefit plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.            Actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. The actual asset returns across the Registrants  pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 0.29% and 0.80%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of
7.00% and 6.46%, respectively.              Discount Rate.  
The discount rate used to determine the majority of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations was 4.29% at December 31, 2015. The discount rates at December 31, 2015 represent weighted-average rates for the majority of pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole
provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated distributions under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The discount
rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.   
        The discount rate assumptions used to determine the obligation at year
end are used to determine the cost for the following year. Exelon used discount rates ranging from 3.68% to 4.43% to estimate its 2016 pension and other postretirement benefit costs.              Health Care Reform Legislation.   In March 2010, the Health Care Reform Acts were signed into law, which
contain a number of provisions that impact retiree health care plans provided by employers, including a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate.
Additional legislation was passed in December 2015 that made some changes to the law, including moving the implementation date of the excise tax from 2018 to 2020. Although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2020, accounting guidance
requires Exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise tax in its annual actuarial valuation. The application of the legislation is still unclear and Exelon continues to monitor the Department of Labor and IRS for additional guidance.
Certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation, including projected inflation rates (based on the CPI). Exelon reflected its best estimate of the expected impact
in its annual actuarial valuation.              Health Care Cost
Trend Rate.   Assumed health care cost trend rates impact the costs reported for Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans for participant populations with plan designs that do not
  
         109   

Table of Contents  

have a cap on cost growth. Accounting guidance requires that annual health care cost estimates be developed using past and present health care cost trends (both for Exelon and across the broader
economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns, technological advances and changes in the health status of plan participants. Therefore, the trend rate assumption is subject
to significant uncertainty. Exelon assumed an initial health care cost trend rate of 6.00% for 2015, decreasing to an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5.00% in 2017.   
          Mortality.   The mortality assumption is composed of a base
table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Exelon uses a mortality base table for its accounting valuation
that is consistent with the IRS required table for funding (referred to as RP-2000). Exelon has a substantial employee population that provides a credible basis for mortality evaluation. Exelon is utilizing the Scale BB 2-Dimensional improvement
scale with long-term improvements of 0.75% for its mortality improvement assumption.              Sensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions.   The following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant
(dollars in millions):         

(a)  
  In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the
discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for a portion of its pension asset portfolio in
2010. The sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.     

(b)  
  Changes in the plan design of certain other postretirement benefit plans have resulted in reduced sensitivity to the health care cost trend rate.     
          Average Remaining Service Period.   For pension benefits,
Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses, as applicable, based on participants  average remaining service periods. The average remaining service period of defined benefit pension plan
participants was 11.9 years, 11.8 years and 11.8 years for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.         
  For other postretirement benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs over participants  average remaining service period to
benefit eligibility age and amortizes its transition obligations and certain actuarial gains and losses over participants  average remaining service period to expected retirement. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit
plan   
         110   

Table of Contents  

participants related to benefit eligibility age was 10.8 years, 9.1 years and 8.7 years for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average remaining service
period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to expected retirement was 9.7 years, 10.1 years and 9.8 years for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   
         Regulatory Accounting (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE account for their regulated electric and
gas operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulations, which requires Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements. This
guidance is applicable to entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities  cost of providing
services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities  costs from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future
recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future
regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. As of December 31, 2015, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE have concluded that the operations of ComEd, PECO and BGE meet the criteria to apply the
authoritative guidance. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of those operations no longer meets the criteria of this guidance, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and
liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and could be material. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE.         
  For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities
continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. Furthermore, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE make other judgments related to the financial statement impact of their
regulatory environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies, if any, to which costs will be recoverable through rates. Refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional
information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with ComEd s distribution formula rate tariff, pursuant to EIMA, and FERC-approved transmission formula rate tariffs for ComEd and BGE. Additionally, estimates are made in accordance
with the authoritative guidance for contingencies as to the amount of revenues billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes. These assessments
are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory bodies in ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the applicable regulatory
body. If the assessments and estimates made by Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be material.   
        The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after
the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.
  
         111

    Accounting for Derivative Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants utilize derivative instruments to manage their
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, changes in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances and changes in the fair value of outstanding debt. Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the
commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. Additionally, Generation enters into energy-related derivatives for proprietary
trading purposes. ComEd has entered into contracts to procure energy, capacity and ancillary services. In addition, ComEd had a financial swap contract with Generation that expired May 31, 2013 and currently holds floating-to-fixed energy swaps
with several unaffiliated suppliers that extend into 2032. PECO and BGE have entered into derivative natural gas contracts to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO has also entered into derivative contracts to procure
electric supply through a competitive RFP process as outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. BGE has also entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive auction process as outlined in its MDPSC-approved SOS
Program. ComEd, PECO and BGE do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. The Registrants  derivative activities are in accordance with Exelon s Risk Management Policy (RMP). See Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  derivative instruments.         
  The Registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. Determining whether or not a contract
qualifies as a derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing the market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts.
Further, interpretive guidance related to the authoritative literature continues to evolve, including how it applies to energy and energy-related products. Changes in management s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and
changes in authoritative guidance related to derivatives, could result in previously excluded contracts being subject to the provisions of the authoritative derivative guidance. Generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium, contracts
to purchase and sell capacity in certain ISO s, certain emission products and RECs do not meet the definition of a derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium, certain
capacity, emission nor the REC markets are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. If these markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and Generation would be required to account for
these contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with Generation s other derivative instruments. In this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts,
Generation would be required to record mark-to-market gains or losses, which may have a significant impact to Exelon s and Generation s financial positions and results of operations.            Under current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for
certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value
hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the
hedged cash flows of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings
immediately. For commodity transactions, effective with the date of the Constellation merger, Generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to
the Constellation merger. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remained probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated OCI and was reclassified to results of operations when the
forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurred. None of   
         112

Constellation s designated cash flow hedges for commodity transactions prior to the Constellation merger were re-designated as cash flow hedges. The effect of this decision is that all
economic hedges for commodities are recorded at fair value through earnings for the combined company. In addition, for energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
recognized in earnings each period. For economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for ComEd, PECO and BGE, changes in the fair value each period are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.   
          Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception.   As part of
Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and
energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. While some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these
qualifying transactions have been designated as normal purchases and normal sales and are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases
and normal sales exception requires that management exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. Revenues
and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. Contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which
physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and is not financially settled on a net basis. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with suppliers as
part of ComEd s energy procurement process, PECO s full requirement contracts and block contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP program, most of PECO s natural gas supply agreements and all of BGE s full requirement contracts and
natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception.         
    Commodity Contracts.   Identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires Generation to determine that the contract is
in accordance with the RMP. Generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the RMP.         
  As a part of accounting for derivatives, the Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements,
interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial
accounting treatment for derivative transactions. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in
the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the
bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an
orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The Registrant s derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading
points. The remaining derivative contracts are valued using models that take into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit
worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid   
         113   

Table of Contents  

markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets
with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in
valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. The Registrants consider
nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. The impacts of
credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements.         
    Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments.   The Registrants may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which
are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve the targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. Additionally, the Registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in
interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings and floating to fixed swaps for project financing. In addition, Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate
component of commodity positions. The characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that
gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does not utilize interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or change in market interest rates. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international
energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. The fair value of the agreements is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to
the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curves. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate and foreign
exchange derivatives are primarily categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain exchange based interest rate derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value
hierarchy.            See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Registrants  derivative instruments.             Taxation (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Significant management judgment
is required in determining the Registrants  provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. In accordance with applicable
authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax
positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the
position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount
of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements.   
         114   

Table of Contents  

   The Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a
forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of
carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the Registrants conclude it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be
realized in future periods.            Actual income taxes could vary
from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Registrants  forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as
well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While the Registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable
authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 15 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding taxes.             Accounting for Loss Contingencies (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  In the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record
liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amounts recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. The estimates that the
Registrants make in accounting for loss contingencies and the actual results that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on their consolidated financial statements.   
          Environmental Costs.   Environmental investigation and
remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties,
the timing of the remediation work, changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Periodic studies are conducted at ComEd, PECO and BGE to determine future remediation requirements and estimates are
adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at Generation to assess the adequacy of its environmental reserves. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant effect on the
Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   
          Other, Including Personal Injury Claims.   The Registrants
are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers  compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves
for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed
each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly,
these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material effect on the Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

    Revenue Recognition (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Sources of Revenue and Determination of Accounting
Treatment.   The Registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of energy and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail) ; 
the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.         
  The appropriate accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable accounting
standards. The Registrants primarily use accrual and mark-to-market accounting as discussed in more detail below.         
    Accrual Accounting.   Under accrual accounting, the Registrants record revenues in the period when services are rendered or energy is
delivered to customers. The Registrants generally use accrual accounting to recognize revenues for sales of electricity, natural gas and other commodities as part of their physical delivery activities. The Registrants enter into these sales
transactions using a variety of instruments, including non-derivative agreements, derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) of commodities that will be physically delivered, sales to utility
customers under regulated service tariffs and spot-market sales, including settlements with independent system operators.         
    Mark-to-Market Accounting.   The Registrants record revenues and expenses using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions
that meet the definition of a derivative for which they are not permitted, or have not elected, the NPNS exception. These mark-to-market transactions primarily relate to risk management activities and economic hedges of other accrual activities.
Mark-to-market revenues and expenses include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable and realized; and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts.   
          Use of Estimates.   Estimates are based upon actual costs
incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliations can be affected by, among other things,
variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.              Unbilled Revenues   .  The determination of Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s retail energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer
meters generally on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is
affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in volumes
delivered to the utilities  customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, revenues may fluctuate
monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for
each meter reading date would also have an effect on the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.         
  See Note 6 Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
          Regulated Transmission   Distribution
Revenues   .  ComEd s EIMA distribution formula rate tariff provides for annual reconciliations to the distribution revenue requirement. As of the balance   
         116   

Table of Contents  

sheet dates, ComEd has recorded its best estimates of the distribution revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC in accordance with
the formula rate mechanism. Estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The
estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed ROE and actions by regulators or courts.         
  ComEd s and BGE s FERC transmission formula rate tariffs provide for annual reconciliations to the transmission revenue requirements. As
of the balance sheet dates, ComEd and BGE have recorded the best estimate of their respective transmission revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that ComEd and BGE believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with the formula rate
mechanism. Estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated
reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.         
   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the
Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd, PECO and BGE estimate the
allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar
credit quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage
of accounts receivable in each risk segment. ComEd, PECO and BGE customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. ComEd,
PECO and BGE customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic
conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC regulations, respectively. See Note 6 Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.   
           Results of Operations by Business Segment    
        The comparisons of operating results and other statistical information

    Results of Operations Generation    

(a)  
  On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, the financial results include
CENG s results of operations on a fully consolidated basis.     

(b)  
  Generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that revenue net of purchased power and
fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to
other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.           
    Net Income Attributable to Membership Interest           
   Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  Generation s net income attributable to membership
interest increased compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to higher revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense and lower operating and maintenance expense; partially offset by the absence of the 2014 gains recorded on the sales of
Generation s ownership interest in generating stations, the absence of the 2014 gain recorded upon the consolidation of CENG, decreased other income and increased income tax expense. The increase in
  
         118   

Table of Contents  

revenue, net of purchase power and fuel expense was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on fully consolidated basis in 2015, the benefit of lower cost to serve load (including
the absence of higher procurement costs for replacement power in 2014), the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal fee, increased capacity prices, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, favorability from portfolio management
optimization activities, increased load served, and mark-to-market gains in 2015 compared to mark-to-market losses in 2014, partially offset by lower margins resulting from the 2014 sale of generating assets, lower realized energy prices, and the
absence of the 2014 fuel optimization opportunities in the South region due to extreme cold weather. The decrease in operating and maintenance expense was largely due to the reduction of long-lived asset impairment charges in 2015 versus 2014,
partially offset by increased labor, contracting and materials expense due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis in 2015 and increased energy efficiency projects. The decrease in other income is primarily the result
of the change in realized and unrealized gains and losses on NDT fund investments in 2015 as compared to 2014.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013.  Generation s net income attributable to membership
interest decreased compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense; partially offset by higher revenue, net of purchase power and fuel expense, higher other income, the
gains recorded on the sale of Generation s ownership interest in generating stations, the bargain-purchase gain recorded related to the Integrys acquisition, and the gain recorded upon consolidation of CENG. The increase in operating and
maintenance expense was largely due to increased labor contracting and materials expense due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis beginning April 1, 2014 and impairment charges related to 1) generating assets
held-for-sale, 2) certain Upstream assets, and 3) wind generating assets. The increase in revenue, net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results beginning April 1, 2014, a decrease in fuel
costs related to the cancellation of DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal fees, an increase in capacity prices, and favorable portfolio management activities in the New England and South regions, partially offset by lower realized energy prices related
to executing Exelon s ratable hedging strategy, higher procurement costs for replacement power due to extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014, and unrealized mark-to-market losses in 2014. The increase in other income is primarily the
result of increased realized and unrealized gains on NDT fund investments.         
    Revenue Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense           
  The basis for Generation s reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic
regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation s hedging strategies and
risk metrics are also aligned with these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation s six reportable segments are as follows:

Idaho, Colorado, and parts of New Mexico, Wyoming and South Dakota.            

Canada  represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes the AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.
              The following business activities are not
allocated to a region, and are reported under Other: natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation s overall operating revenues or results of operations. Further, the following activities
are not allocated to a region, and are reported in the table below in Other: unrealized mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities; amortization of certain intangible assets relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from
mergers and acquisitions; and other miscellaneous revenues.         
  Generation evaluates the operating performance of its power marketing activities using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel
expense, which is a non-GAAP measurement. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of
electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements.   
        For the years ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and
December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, Generation s revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense by region were as follows:

         Mid-Atlantic              Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic of $140 million was primarily due to the inclusion of CENG s results on a fully consolidated basis for the full year in 2015, the benefit of lower cost to serve load (which includes the
absence of higher procurement costs for replacement power due to extreme cold weather in the first quarter of 2014), increased load volumes served, higher nuclear volumes, the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal fee, and favorability
from portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by lower capacity revenues, and lower generation volumes due to the sale of generating assets.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2013 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic of $161 million was primarily due to the consolidation of CENG, the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal fees in 2014, and
favorable portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by higher procurement costs for replacement power, lower nuclear volumes (excluding CENG), lower capacity revenues, and lower realized energy prices related to executing
Generation s ratable hedging strategy.             Midwest    
         Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2014 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest of $293 million was primarily due to higher capacity revenues, increased load volumes served, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015,
the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal fee in 2014, and favorability from portfolio management optimization activities, partially offset by lower nuclear volumes.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2013 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest of $13 million was primarily due to higher capacity prices, higher nuclear volumes, and the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fuel
disposal fee, partially offset by lower realized energy prices related to executing Generation s ratable hedging strategy.         
   New England          
   Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel
expense in New England of $110 million was primarily due to the benefit of lower cost to serve load, increased load volumes served, the inclusion of Integrys  results in 2015, and favorability from portfolio management optimization activities,
partially offset by lower generation volumes due to the sale of a generating asset.             Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in New England of $166 million was primarily due to higher
realized energy prices and favorable impacts from the restructuring of a fuel supply contract, partially offset by lower generation volume.         
   New York          
   Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  The $151 million increase in revenue net of purchased power

December 31, 2013.  The $119 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in ERCOT was primarily due to higher procurement costs for replacement power in the second quarter of 2014 and the termination of an energy
supply contract with a retail power supply company that was previously a consolidated variable interest entity. As a result of the termination, Generation no longer has a variable interest in the retail supply company and ceased consolidation of the
entity during the third quarter of 2013. The decreases were partially offset by higher generation volume in the first quarter of 2014.         
   Other Power Regions          
   Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  The decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel
expense in Other Power Regions of $77 million was primarily due to the amortization of contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, lower realized energy prices, the absence of the 2014 fuel optimization opportunities,
partially offset by increased generation from power purchase agreements, and decreased fuel costs.             Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013.  The $126 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in Other Power Regions was primarily due to
higher generation volumes and higher realized energy prices.             Proprietary
Trading              Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  The $41 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in Proprietary trading was primarily due to the absence of gains on congestion trading products.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2013.  The $50 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in Proprietary trading was primarily due to gains on congestion trading products.             Mark-to-market          
  Generation is exposed to market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these
fluctuations. See Note 12 Fair Value of Financial

   Other              Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  The $246 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to the amortization of energy
contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, the inclusion of Integrys  gas results in 2015, and an increase in distributed generation and energy efficiency activity. See Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding energy contract intangibles.             Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013.  The $246 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to the amortization of energy
contracts recorded at fair value associated with prior acquisitions, partially offset by a loss on gas inventory from lower of cost or market adjustments in 2014. See Note 11 Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information regarding energy contract intangibles.         
    Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor           
  The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for 2015, as compared to 2014 and 2013, for the Generation-operated plants. The nuclear
fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period. Generation considers
capacity factor useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. Generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a
presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

  Excludes Salem, which is operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC. Reflects ownership percentage of stations operated by Exelon. As of April 1, 2014, CENG is included at ownership.
              Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2014 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem, decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a higher number of refueling outage days and non-outage energy losses, partially offset by a lower
number of unplanned outage days. For 2015 and 2014, planned refueling outage days totaled 290 and 275, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 82 and 92, respectively   
         Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2013 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. While total days offline

were greater in 2014 as compared to 2013, the larger capacity units were online for more days in 2014. Additionally, with the addition of the CENG nuclear facilities there were more days offline
in 2014 associated with units where Exelon s ownership percentage diminishes the impact on capacity factor. For 2014 and 2013, planned refueling outage days totaled 275 and 233, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 92 and 75,
respectively.              Operating and Maintenance Expense

         Results of Operations ComEd    

(a)  
  ComEd evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Revenue net of purchased power expense. ComEd believes that Revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful
measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. In general, ComEd only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. ComEd has included its discussion of Revenue net of
purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, Revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies 
presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.     

(b)  
  For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd s electric distribution and transmission formula rates, and riders, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully
recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings).     
          Net Income               Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014.  ComEd s Net income for the
year ended December 31, 2015 was higher than the same period in 2014 primarily due to increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment, partially offset by lower
allowed electric distribution ROE), partially offset by unfavorable weather and volume.   
         128   

Table of Contents  

    Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013.  ComEd s
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was higher than the same period in 2013 primarily due to the 2013 remeasurement of Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position and increased electric distribution and transmission formula rate
earnings (reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment), partially offset by unfavorable weather.              Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power Expense              There are certain drivers of Operating revenue that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power expense, such as commodity procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. ComEd is permitted
to recover electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in electricity procurement costs have no impact on Revenue net of purchased power expense. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s electricity procurement process.         
  All ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. Customer choice programs do not impact
ComEd s volume of deliveries, but do affect ComEd s Operating revenue related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in Purchased power expense. Therefore, customer choice programs have no impact on Revenue net of purchased power
expense.            Retail deliveries purchased from competitive
electric generation suppliers (as a percentage of kWh sales) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, consisted of the following:         
          Retail customers purchasing electric
generation from competitive electric generation suppliers at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:         
          Under an Illinois law allowing
municipalities to arrange the purchase of electricity for their participating residents, the City of Chicago previously participated in ComEd s customer choice program and arranged the purchase of electricity from Constellation (formerly
Integrys), for those participating residents. In September 2015, the City of Chicago discontinued its participation in the customer choice program and many of those participating residents resumed their purchase of electricity from ComEd.
ComEd s Operating revenue has increased as a result of the City of Chicago switching, but that increase is fully offset in Purchased power expense.   
         129   

Table of Contents  

   The changes in ComEd s Revenue net of purchased power expense for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, and for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, consisted of the following:   
     
           Weather.  The demand for
electricity is affected by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage.
Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, unfavorable weather conditions reduced Operating revenue net of purchased power expense when compared to the prior years.   
        Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect
the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in ComEd s service territory with cooling degree days generally
having a more significant impact to ComEd, particularly during the summer months. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:

Volume.  Revenue net of purchased
power expense decreased as a result of lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting decreased average usage per residential customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs,
as compared to the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Revenue net of purchased power expense remained relatively consistent, as compared to the same period in 2013.   
         Electric Distribution Revenue.  EIMA provides for a
performance-based formula rate tariff, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Under EIMA, electric distribution
  
         130   

Table of Contents  

revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, allowed ROE, and other billing determinants. ComEd s allowed ROE is the annual
average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus 580 basis points, subject to a collar of plus or minus 50 basis points. Therefore, the collar limits favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and load on revenue. During the year ended
December 31, 2015, electric distribution revenue increased $180 million, primarily due to higher Operating and maintenance expense and increased capital investment, partially offset by lower allowed ROE due to decreased treasury rates. During
the year ended December 31, 2014, electric distribution revenue decreased $2 million, primarily due to lower Operating and maintenance expense resulting from certain OPEB plan design changes, partially offset by increased capital investment.
See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Transmission Revenue.  Under a FERC-approved formula,
transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants, such as the highest daily peak load from the previous calendar year. During the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd recorded increased transmission revenue primarily due to higher Operating and maintenance expense and increased capital investment. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters
of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in Operating revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as ComEd s energy efficiency and
demand response and purchased power administrative costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. An equal and offsetting amount has been included in Operating and maintenance expense. See Operating and maintenance expense
discussion below for additional information on included programs.             Uncollectible Accounts Recovery, Net.  Uncollectible accounts recovery, net, represents recoveries under ComEd s uncollectible accounts tariff. See Operating and maintenance expense discussion below for
additional information on this tariff.             Pricing and
Customer Mix.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the decrease in Revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased usage across all major
customer classes and change in customer mix. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the increase in Revenue net of purchased power as a result of pricing and customer mix is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to
decreased usage across all major customer classes and change in customer mix.             Revenue Subject to Refund.  ComEd records revenue subject to refund based upon its best estimate of customer collections that may be required to be refunded. Revenue net of purchase power expense was higher
for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the one-time revenue refund recorded in 2014 associated with the 2007 Rate Case.         
   Other.  Other revenue, which can vary period to period, includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, assistance provided
to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, recoveries of environmental costs associated with MGP sites, and recoveries of energy procurement costs.

     Operating and Maintenance Expense     

(a)  
  Operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and
current basis through approved regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in Operating revenue.           
  The changes in Operating and maintenance expense for year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, and for the year ended
December 31, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Primarily reflects increased contracting costs related to preventative maintenance and other projects for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased contracting costs
resulting from new projects associated with EIMA for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding EIMA.

(b)  
  The increase from 2014 to 2015 primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of lower assumed pension and OPEB discount rates and an increase in the life expectancy assumption for
plan participants, partially offset by cost savings from plan design changes for certain OPEB plans effective April 2014 and forward. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 primarily reflects the cost savings from plan design changes for certain OPEB plans
effective April 2014 and forward. See Note 16 Retirement Benefits of the Exelon 2014 Form 10-K for additional information regarding plan changes.     

(c)  
  ComEd is allowed to recover from or refund to customers the difference between the utility s annual uncollectible accounts expense and the amounts collected in rates
annually through a rider mechanism. In 2015 and 2014, ComEd recorded a net increase in Operating and maintenance expense related to uncollectible accounts due to the timing of regulatory cost recovery. An equal and offsetting amount has been
recognized in Operating revenue for the periods presented.     

(d)

the following:         

(b)  
  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, primarily relates to a decrease in MGP regulatory asset amortization and ComEd s severance regulatory assets fully
amortizing during 2014.                Taxes Other Than Income
             Taxes other than income, which can vary year to
year, include municipal and state utility taxes, real estate taxes, and payroll taxes. Taxes other than income remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, and for the year ended

     Operating Revenue Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense     
        Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense
are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. PECO s electric supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to adjustments as specified in the PAPUC-approved tariffs that are designed to recover or refund the
difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with PECO s GSA and PGC, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no
impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense.            Electric and natural gas revenue and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the Customer Choice Program. All PECO customers have the choice to purchase electricity
and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers, respectively. The customer s choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy
and natural gas service. Customer Choice Program activity has no impact on electric and natural gas revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense.         
  Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) for
the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 consisted of the following:         
          Retail customers purchasing electric
generation and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 consisted of the following:         
          The changes in PECO s Operating
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2014 and 2013, respectively, consisted of the following:   
     
           Weather.  The demand for
electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric   
         136   

Table of Contents  

and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of
electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was higher primarily due to the impact of favorable 2015 summer and first
quarter winter weather conditions, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable fourth quarter 2015 winter weather conditions in PECO s service territory.         
  Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was lower due to the impact of unfavorable 2014
summer and fourth quarter weather conditions, partially offset by the impact of favorable first quarter 2014 winter weather conditions in PECO s service territory.   
        Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect
the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling
degree days in PECO s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 compared to the same periods in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:   

Volume.  The increase in
Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily reflects the impact of moderate economic and customer growth partially
offset by energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages for gas and residential and small commercial and industrial electric classes. Additionally, the increase represents a shift in the volume profile across classes from large commercial and
industrial classes to residential and small commercial and industrial classes for electric.            The increase in Operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily reflects the impact of
moderate economic and customer growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages for gas and residential electric and a shift in the volume profile across classes from commercial and industrial classes to residential
classes for electric.             Pricing.  The increase in
electric operating revenue net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to increased monthly customer demand in the commercial and industrial classes. The increase in
natural gas operating revenue net of fuel expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily attributable to higher overall effective rates due to decreased retail gas usage.   
        The decrease in natural gas operating revenue net of fuel expense as a

Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense as a result of the December 2013 and 2014 electric and gas distribution rate orders issued by the MDPSC offset by increases in Operating and
maintenance expense and Depreciation expense.              Operating Revenue Net
of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense              There are
certain drivers to Operating revenue that are offset by their impact on Purchased power and fuel expense, such as commodity procurement costs and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric or natural gas supplier. Electric and gas
revenue and Purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. BGE s electric and natural gas rates charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the
difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the MDPSC s market-based SOS and gas commodity programs, respectively.   
        BGE is obligated to provide market-based SOS to all of its electric
customers. The SOS rates charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes a shareholder return component, which for residential SOS customers is being returned to residential
distribution customers through December 31, 2016, and an incremental cost component. Bidding to supply BGE s market-based SOS occurs through a competitive bidding process approved by the MDPSC. Successful bidders, which may include
Generation, will execute contracts with BGE for terms of three months or two years. BGE is obligated by the MDPSC to provide several variations of SOS to commercial and industrial customers depending on customer load. Charges incurred for electric
supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in Purchased power from affiliates on BGE s Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
        The number of customers electing to select a competitive electric
generation supplier affects electric SOS revenue and purchased power expense. The number of customers electing to select a competitive natural gas supplier affects gas cost adjustment revenue and purchased natural gas expense. All BGE customers have
the choice to purchase energy from a competitive electric generation supplier and/or natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier. This customer choice of electric generation suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects
revenue collected from customers related to SOS.            Retail
deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers (as a percentage of kWh and mmcf sales, respectively) at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following:

December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, respectively, consisted of the following:         
           Revenue Decoupling.  The demand
for electricity and gas is affected by weather and usage conditions. The MDPSC has allowed BGE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas distribution revenue from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of
large industrial electric customers, and all firm service gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on BGE s electric and gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of
distribution revenue per customer, by customer class, regardless of changes in consumption levels. This allows BGE to recognize revenue at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what BGE s actual distribution volumes were for a
billing period. Therefore, while this revenue is affected by customer growth,  it  will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions. BGE bills or credits impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved
revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.            Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree
days for a 30-year period in BGE s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in BGE s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 and for the year ended
December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, respectively, and normal weather consisted of the following:         
       
           Distribution Rate Increase . The
increase in distribution revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became effective in December 2014 in accordance with the
MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate case order.            The increase in distribution revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the impact of new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became

   Regulatory Required Programs.  This represents the change in revenue collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the energy
efficiency and demand response programs as well as administrative and commercial and industrial customer bad debt costs for SOS. The riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs
are included in Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense and Taxes other than income in BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
         Transmission Revenue.  Under a FERC-approved formula,
transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the increase in transmission revenue
was primarily due to higher Operating and maintenance expense and increased capital investment. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.             Other . Other revenue, which can vary
from period to period, includes miscellaneous revenue such as service application and late payment fees.              Operating and Maintenance Expense              The changes in operating and maintenance expense for 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 consisted of the following:   

(a)  
  Storm-related costs decreased due to lack of major storms for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.     

(b)  
  Uncollectible accounts expense decreased primarily due to improved customer behavior and favorable weather for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period
in 2014.                Conduit Lease with City of Baltimore
             On September 23, 2015, the Baltimore City
Board of Estimates approved an increase in rental fees for access to the Baltimore City conduit system effective November 1, 2015, which is expected to result in an increase to operating and maintenance expense of approximately $24 million in
2016 subject to an annual increase based on the Consumer Price Index. On October 16, 2015, BGE filed a lawsuit against the City in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to protect its customers from any improper use by the City of the conduit
fee revenues and to place constraints on the City s ability to set the conduit fee in the future.   
         144   

Table of Contents  

   Among the relief sought by BGE was a preliminary injunction preventing the City from enforcing its
substantial increase in the conduit fee rate during the course of the litigation. A hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on December 15, 2015. While BGE s motion for preliminary injunction was denied, the Court s
decision was premised upon several important concessions or acknowledgments made by the City in its written papers and at the hearing. Most importantly, the City conceded that it can charge BGE only for the actual costs of conduit maintenance and
that a true-up process is required to the extent that the City fails to spend the amount collected for conduit maintenance.         
  As part of its electric and gas distribution rate case filed on November 6, 2015, and as amended on January 5, 2016, BGE is proposing to
recover the annual increase in conduit fees, effective November 1, 2015 of approximately $30 million through a surcharge. BGE cannot predict if the MDPSC will approve BGE s request for a conduit fee surcharge.   
          Depreciation and Amortization Expense     
        The changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 compared
to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Depreciation expense increased due to ongoing capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared 2013. The increase for the year
ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was offset by the effect of revised depreciation rates established in accordance with the MDPSC approved December 2014 electric and natural gas distribution rate case order.     

(b)  
  Regulatory asset amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to a reduction in regulatory asset amortization related

      Liquidity and Capital Resources    
        Exelon s and Generation s prior year activity presented
below includes the activity of CENG, from the integration date effective April 1, 2014. All results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.   
        The Registrants  operating and capital expenditures requirements
are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital
resources. Each Registrant s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions
deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5
billion, $5.3 billion, $1 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Exelon Corporate, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE s syndicated revolving credit facilities expire in 2018 and 2019. In addition, Generation has $0.4 billion in
bilateral facilities with banks which have various expirations between March 2016 and January 2019. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue
letters of credit. See the  Credit Matters  section below for further discussion. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.   
        The Registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash,
to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on
capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, ComEd, PECO and BGE operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where
such recovery takes place over an extended period of time.         
  See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
Registrants  debt and credit agreements.             PHI Merger Financing
            Exelon has raised cash to fund the all-cash purchase
price, acquisition and integration related costs, and merger commitments, through the issuance of $4.2 billion of debt (of which $3.3 billion remains after execution of the exchange offer, see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for further
information on the exchange), $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity units, the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock, cash proceeds of $1.8 billion from asset sales primarily at Generation (after-tax
proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion) and the remaining balance from cash on hand and/or short-term borrowings available to Exelon. Exelon will have sufficient cash to fund the all-cash purchase price, acquisition and integration related costs,
and merger commitments. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 19 Shareholder s Equity for further information on the debt and equity issuances. In the event the PHI merger is terminated, the Board of Directors could direct
Exelon to use its existing cash on hand to retire debt, to return capital to shareholders or for other general corporate purposes.

            Management considers various factors when making
pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, management of the
pension obligation and regulatory implications. On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the Twenty-first Century Act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower pension
contributions in the near term while increasing the premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Certain provisions of the law were applied in 2012 while others took effect in 2013. On August 8, 2014, this funding
relief was extended for five years. On November 2, 2015 the funding relief was extended for an additional three years and premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation were further increased. The estimated impacts of
the law are reflected in the projected pension contributions below.            Exelon expects to make qualified pension plan contributions of $250 million to its qualified pension plans in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE expect to contribute $134 million, $30 million, $28
million and $31 million, respectively. Exelon s and Generation s expected qualified pension plan contributions above include $25 million related to the legacy CENG plans that will be funded by CENG as provided in an Employee Matters
Agreement (EMA) between Exelon and CENG. Exelon s non-qualified pension plans are not funded. Exelon expects to make non-qualified pension plan benefit payments of $21 million in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE will make payments
of $9 million, $2 million, $1 million and $1 million respectively. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Registrants  2015 and 2014 pension contributions.   
        To the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension plans
do not earn the expected asset return rates, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. Additionally, the contributions above could change if Exelon changes its pension funding strategy.   
        Unlike qualified pension plans, other postretirement benefit plans are
not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements and certain plans are not funded. Exelon s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its funded other postretirement benefit
plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulator expectations and best assure continued recovery). Exelon expects to make other postretirement benefit plan contributions, including
benefit payments related to unfunded plans, of approximately $35 million in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE   
         149

expect to contribute $13 million, $3 million, $1 million, and $18 million, respectively. See Note 17  Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the
Registrants  2015 and 2014 other postretirement benefit contributions.            See the  Contractual Obligations  section for management s estimated future pension and other postretirement benefits contributions.             Tax Matters          
  The Registrants  future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by the following tax matters:   

In the event of a fully successful IRS challenge to Exelon s like-kind exchange position, Exelon would be required to either post a bond or pay the tax and
interest for the tax years before the court to appeal the decision. If an adverse decision is reached in 2016, the potential tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become payable may be as much as $860 million, of which
approximately $300 million would be attributable to ComEd after consideration of Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of the after-tax interest amounts on ComEd s equity, and the balance at Exelon. It is
expected that Exelon s remaining tax years affected by the litigation will be settled following a final appellate decision which could take several years.      

Exelon, Generation, and ComEd expect to receive tax refunds of approximately $430 million, $190 million, and $260 million, respectively, in 2016. PECO expects to
make tax payments of approximately $7 million related to IRS positions settling in 2016.            

State and local governments continue to face increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income tax levies, property taxes and
other taxes or the imposition, extension or permanence of temporary tax levies.            

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed H.R. 2029, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act. The Act included an extension of 50% bonus
depreciation for 2015 2017. It also includes provisions for 40% and 30% bonus depreciation allowance for qualified property placed in service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. As a result of the 50% bonus depreciation extension for 2015, Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE are estimated to generate incremental cash in 2016 of approximately $690 million, $350 million, $220 million, $70 million, and $50 million, respectively. Furthermore, the extension of 50% bonus depreciation resulted
in a decrease to Generation s Domestic Production Activities Deduction, reducing cash tax benefits and increasing income tax expense by approximately $65 million in 2015. Due to the extension of bonus depreciation, ComEd s 2015 revenue
requirement decreased by approximately $10 million (after-tax).

Table of Contents  

   The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting Exelon s cash flows from
operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  Represents depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, net fair value changes related to derivatives, deferred income taxes, provision for uncollectible accounts,
pension and non-pension postretirement benefit expense, equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates and investments, decommissioning-related items, stock compensation expense, impairment of long-lived assets, and other non-cash
charges. See note 24  Supplemental Financial Information for further detail on non-cash operating activity.     

(b)  
  Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion of long-term debt.
    
          Cash flows
provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 by Registrant were as follows:         
     
          Changes in
Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each Registrant s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the
normal course of business, except as discussed below. In addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:   
         Generation    

Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from its
counterparties. In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the OTC markets. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Generation had net collections/(payments) of
counterparty cash collateral of $407 million, $(1,748) million and $162 million, respectively, primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to      
         151   

Table of Contents  

Generation s net mark-to-market position, as well as Exelon s decision to post more cash collateral in 2014 compared to using letters of credit in 2015 to support the PHI merger
financing.            

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Generation had net collections/(payments) of approximately $58 million, $38 million and $(36) million, respectively, related to
purchases and sales of options. The level of option activity in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.      
         ComEd          

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, ComEd s payables for Generation energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $(28) million, $5 million and $(16) million,
respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased by $2 million, $27 million and $35 million, respectively.            

During 2015, ComEd posted $31 million of cash collateral to PJM. During 2014, ComEd posted no cash collateral to PJM. ComEd s collateral posted with PJM has
increased year over year primarily due to higher RPM credit requirements and higher PJM billings resulting from increased load being served by ComEd as a result of City of Chicago customers switching back to ComEd.      
         PECO          

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, PECO s payables to Generation for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $7 million, $(9) million and $(17) million,
respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $(38) million, $10 million and $39 million, respectively.      
         BGE          

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, BGE s payables to Generation for energy purchases increased/(decreased) by $(9) million, $13 million and $(4) million,
respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases decreased by $(25) million, $(7) million and $(12) million, respectively.      
          Cash Flows from Investing Activities     
        Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 by Registrant were as follows:

Table of Contents  

    Generation    
        Generation has entered into several agreements to acquire equity
interests in privately held development stage entities which develop energy-related technology. The agreements contain a series of scheduled investment commitments, including in-kind services contributions. There are approximately $327 million of
anticipated expenditures remaining through 2018 to fund anticipated planned capital and operating needs of the associated companies, of which up to $172 million will be contributed by a non-controlling interest holder. See Note 23 Commitments
and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of Generation s equity interests.         
  Capital expenditures by Registrant for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 and projected amounts for 2016 are as follows:

(a)  
  Total projected capital expenditures do not include adjustments for non-cash activity.     

(c)  
  The capital expenditures and 2016 projections include $610 million of expected incremental spending pursuant to EIMA, ComEd has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion
over a ten year period to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology.     

(d)  
  Other primarily consists of corporate operations and BSC.     

(e)  
  Generation s capital expenditures for the projected full year 2016 includes nuclear fuel of $1.1 billion and growth expenditures of $1.4 billion.     
        Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to
periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.            In 2014, Exelon and its affiliates initiated a comprehensive project to ensure corporate-wide compliance with Version 5 of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure
Protection Standards (CIP V.5) which will become effective on April 1, 2016. Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE will be incurring incremental capital expenditures through 2016 associated with the CIP V.5 compliance implementation project, which
are included in projected capital expenditures above.         
   Generation          
  Approximately 32% and 15% of the projected 2016 capital expenditures at Generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel and the construction of
new natural gas plants, respectively, with the remaining amounts reflecting investment in renewable energy and additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). Generation
anticipates that they will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.   
         153   

Table of Contents  

    ComEd, PECO and BGE    
        Approximately 86%, 98% and 97% of the projected 2016 capital
expenditures at ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as ComEd s reliability
related investments required under EIMA, and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s construction commitments under PJM s RTEP. In addition to the capital expenditure for continuing projects, ComEd s total expenditures include smart
grid/smart meter technology required under EIMA and for PECO and BGE, total capital expenditures related to their respective smart meter program.         
  In 2010, NERC provided guidance to transmission owners that recommends ComEd, PECO, and BGE perform assessments of their transmission lines. In
compliance with this guidance, ComEd, PECO and BGE submitted their final bi-annual reports to NERC in January 2014. ComEd, PECO and BGE have been incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of
the assessments. Specific projects and expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s forecasted 2016 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed in
2017.            ComEd, PECO and BGE anticipate that they will fund
capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent, including ComEd s capital expenditures associated with EIMA as further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory
Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
    Cash Flows from Financing Activities

          Credit Matters     
         Market Conditions    
        The Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working
capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include $8.4 billion in aggregate
total commitments of which $6.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2015, and of which no financial institution has more than 7% of the aggregate commitments for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. The Registrants had access to the
commercial paper market during 2015 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing
various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the
financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See PART I. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for
further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.            The Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If Generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of
December 31, 2015, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $2.0 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables,
net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of $4.3 billion. If ComEd lost its investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2015, it would
have been required to provide collateral of $31 million pursuant to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide incremental collateral of $19 million which is well within its current available credit facility capacity of $998
million. If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2015 it would have been required to provide collateral of $2 million pursuant to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $25
million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which, in the aggregate, are well within PECO s current available credit facility capacity of $599 million. If BGE lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2015 it
would have been required to

provide collateral of $6 million pursuant to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $35 million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which, in
the aggregate, are well within BGE s current available credit facility capacity of $600 million.         
   Exelon Credit Facilities          
  Exelon, ComEd and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet
their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting
short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Registrants  credit facilities and short term
borrowing activity.             Other Credit Matters    
          Capital Structure   .  At December 31, 2015, the
capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Includes approximately $641 million, $205 million, $184 million and $252 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE respectively. These special
purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd, PECO and BGE. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the authoritative guidance for VIEs.                Intercompany Money Pool.   To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, Exelon operates
an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participants during the year ended December 31, 2015, in addition to the net contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2015, are presented in
the following table:         
            Investments in Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds.   Exelon, Generation and CENG maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be
used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with Generation s
NDT fund investment policy. Generation s and CENG s investment policies establish limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in any one

industry. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the trust funds, the NRC s minimum
funding requirements and related liquidity ramifications.         
    Shelf Registration Statements.   The Registrants have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount,
filed with the SEC, that will expire in May 2017. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale,
including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.         
    Regulatory Authorizations.   As of December 31, 2015, ComEd had $442 million available in long-term debt refinancing authority and
$353 million available in new money long-term debt financing authority from the ICC. In November 2015, the PAPUC approved PECO s application for long-term financing for $2.5 billion, which is effective through December 31, 2018. As of
December 31, 2015, PECO had $1.9 billion available in long-term debt financing authority from the PAPUC. As of December 31, 2015, BGE had $1.4 billion available in long-term financing authority from MDPSC.   
        As of December 31, 2015, ComEd, PECO and BGE had short-term
financing authority from FERC, which expires on December 31, 2017, of $2.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $700 million, respectively. Generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate
authority. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
  Exelon s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of
dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility
 to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  In addition, under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things,
its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless ComEd has specific authorization from the ICC. BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions
established by the MDPSC. First, BGE was prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity
ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must
notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends unless: (1) BGE elects to defer interest payments
on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on BGE s preference stock have not been paid. At December 31, 2015,
Exelon had retained earnings of $12,068 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $2,701 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $978 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,617 million
partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, PECO s retained earnings of $780 million and BGE s retained earnings $1,320 million. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to

ITEM 7A.   
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            
  The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity
prices. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive
officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk
Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities.               Commodity Price Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather
conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon has price risk from commodity price movements.
Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel, and other commodities.   
         169   

Table of Contents  

     Generation     
          Normal Operations and Hedging Activities.   Electricity
available from Generation s owned or contracted generation supply in excess of Generation s obligations to customers, including portions of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce
price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation
believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2016 through 2018.   
        In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a
positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon s hedging program involves the hedging of commodity risk for Exelon s expected generation,
typically on a ratable basis over a three year period. As of December 31, 2015, the proportion of expected generation hedged is 90%-93%, 60%-63% and 28%-31% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is
the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model
that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain
non-derivative contracts including Generation s sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.         
  A portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices,
which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation s entire non-proprietary trading portfolio associated with a
$5 reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2015, market conditions and hedged position would be a decrease in pre-tax net income of approximately $50 million, $400 million and $725 million,
respectively, for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation expects to actively manage its portfolio to mitigate market price risk
exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation s portfolio.   
          Proprietary Trading Activities.   Generation also enters
into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent
of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including
volume, stop loss and Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the Exelon risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading
activities, which included physical volumes of 7,310 GWh, 10,571 GWh, and 8,762 GWh for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio, but represent a small
portion of Generation s overall revenue from energy marketing activities. Proprietary trading portfolio activity for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulted in pre-tax gains of $1 million due to net mark-to-market losses of $8 million
and realized gains of $9 million. Generation uses a 95% confidence interval, assuming standard normal distribution, one day holding period, one-tailed statistical measure in calculating its VaR. The daily VaR on proprietary trading activity averaged
$0.2 million of exposure during the year. Generation has not segregated proprietary trading activity within the following discussion because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to
  
         170   

Table of Contents  

Generation s total Revenue net of purchase power and fuel expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $9,114 million.   
          Fuel Procurement  . Generation procures coal and natural
gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrates supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or
a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make
Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 50% of Generation s uranium
concentrate requirements from 2016 through 2020 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be
unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial
positions. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information regarding uranium and coal supply agreement matters.   
          ComEd     
        The financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd was deemed
prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, thereby ensuring that ComEd would be entitled to receive full cost recovery in rates. The change in fair value each period was recorded by ComEd with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability. This
financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd expired on May 31, 2013. All realized impacts have been included in Generation s and ComEd s results of operations.            ComEd entered into 20-year contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to recover
its renewable energy and REC costs from retail customers with no mark-up. The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing contract terms. Pursuant to the ICC s Order on
December 19, 2012, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. In addition, the ICC s December 18, 2013 Order approved the reduction of
ComEd s commitments under those contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, and the amount of the reduction was approved by the ICC in March 2014. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives.         
    PECO           
  PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP
Programs, which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO has certain full requirements contracts and block contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify
for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Under the DSP Programs, PECO is permitted to recover its electric supply
procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up.   
         171   

Table of Contents  

   PECO has also entered into derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for the normal
purchases and normal sales exception or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge its long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO s hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct
impact on its financial position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.         
  PECO does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note
13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
    BGE           
  BGE procures electric supply for default service customers through full requirements contracts pursuant to BGE s MDPSC-approved SOS program.
BGE s full requirements contracts that are considered derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance and as a result, are accounted for on an accrual basis of
accounting. Under the SOS program, BGE is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers, plus an administrative fee which includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component. However, through
December 2016, BGE provides all residential electric customers a credit for the residential shareholder return component of the administrative charge.         
  BGE has also entered into derivative natural gas contracts, which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception, to hedge its
price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on BGE s financial position. However, under BGE s market-based rates incentive mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared
to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers.   
        BGE does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary
trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
          Trading and Non-Trading Marketing Activities     
        The following detailed presentation of Exelon s,
Generation s and ComEd s trading and non-trading marketing activities is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industry s Committee of Chief Risk Officers (CCRO).

         Credit Risk, Collateral, and Contingent Related Features (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             The Registrants would be exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See
Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk, collateral, and contingent related features.              Generation           
  The following tables provide information on Generation s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, normal purchase normal sales
agreements, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2015. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and
provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure
from individual retail customers, uranium procurement contracts, and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE, and Nodal commodity exchanges, which are discussed below. Additionally, the figures in the tables below exclude exposures with affiliates,
including net receivables with ComEd, PECO and BGE of $15 million, $36 million and $31 million, respectively. See Note 26 Related Party Transactions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

  As of December 31, 2015, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $13 million of cash and $69 million of letters of credit.
               ComEd     
        Credit risk for ComEd is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. ComEd is currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. ComEd records a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical
experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. ComEd
is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation as well as the ICC-approved procurement tariffs. ComEd will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision
for uncollectible accounts. The Illinois Settlement Legislation prohibits utilities, including ComEd, from terminating electric service to a residential electric space heat customer due to nonpayment between December 1 of any year through
March 1 of the following year. ComEd s ability to disconnect non space-heating residential customers is also impacted by certain weather restrictions, at any time of year, under the Illinois Public Utilities Act. ComEd will monitor the
impact of its disconnection practices and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. ComEd did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2015. See Note
3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ComEd s recently approved tariffs to adjust rates annually through a rider mechanism to reflect increases or decreases in
annual uncollectible accounts expense.            ComEd s power
procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the
contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid
deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents ComEd s net credit exposure. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to
  
         176   

Table of Contents  

recover realized energy costs through customer rates. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s credit exposure to energy suppliers was immaterial.   
          PECO     
        Credit risk for PECO is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. PECO is currently obligated to provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. PECO records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the
potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with PAPUC regulations,
after November 30 and before April 1, an electric distribution utility or natural gas distribution utility shall not terminate service to customers with household incomes at or below 250% of the Federal poverty level. PECO s provision
for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as well as changes in PAPUC regulations. PECO did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2015.   
        PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP
Program contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the
supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is
executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than
the supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2015, PECO had no net credit exposure with suppliers.         
  PECO does not obtain cash collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements. As of December 31, 2015,
PECO s credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers was immaterial.         
    BGE           
  Credit risk for BGE is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. BGE is currently
obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. BGE records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. BGE will monitor nonpayment from
customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for uncollectible accounts policy. MDPSC
regulations prohibit BGE from terminating service to residential customers due to nonpayment from November 1 through March 31 if the forecasted temperature is 32 degrees or below for the subsequent 72 hour period. BGE is also prohibited by
the Public Utilities Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland and MDPSC regulations from terminating service to residential customers due to nonpayment if the forecasted temperature is 95 degrees or above for the subsequent 72 hour period. BGE did
not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2015.            BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a
supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the
supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day   
         177   

Table of Contents  

a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required
to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2015, BGE had no net credit exposure with
suppliers.            BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to
market-price risk. This market-price risk is mitigated by BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make off-system sales after BGE has satisfied its customers 
demands, which are not covered by the gas cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, BGE had credit exposure of $4 million related to off-system sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or right to offset clauses
within other contracts with those third-party suppliers.              Collateral
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)           
    Generation           
  As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity,
natural gas and other commodities. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit Generation and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In
accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade
as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation s net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that
specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e.
capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding collateral requirements.            Generation transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure
to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation
is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation. In order to post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities,
which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        As of December 31, 2015, Generation had cash collateral of $1,267
million posted and cash collateral held of $21 million for external counterparties with derivative positions, of which $1,234 million and $9 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against energy derivatives and interest rate and foreign
exchange derivatives related to underlying energy contracts, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, $3 million of cash collateral deposits was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related
derivatives or as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. As of December 31, 2014, Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,497 million and cash collateral held of $77 million for external counterparties with derivative
positions, of which $1,406 million and $6 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against   
         178   

Table of Contents  

energy derivatives and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives related to underlying energy contracts, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, $8 million of cash collateral posted was
not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives or as the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.         
    ComEd           
  As of December 31, 2015, ComEd held no collateral from suppliers in association with standard block energy procurement contracts and held
approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit for renewable energy contracts. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.              PECO     
        As of December 31, 2015, PECO was not required to post collateral
under its energy and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.              BGE           
  BGE is not required to post collateral under its electric supply contracts. As of December 31, 2015, BGE was not required to post collateral
under its natural gas procurement contracts nor was it holding collateral under its electric supply and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.              RTOs and ISOs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)              Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE
participate in all, or some, of the established, real-time energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, ISO-NY, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO and ERCOT. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers
and on the spot markets that are operated by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or
ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one
member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial
positions.              Exchange Traded Transactions (Exelon and Generation)
             Generation enters into commodity transactions on
NYMEX, ICE and the Nodal exchange. The NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a
result, transactions on NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.

     Long-Term Leases (Exelon)     
        Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of December 31,
2015, included a $352 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia subject to long-term leases. This investment represents the estimated residual value of leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms of $639 million, less
unearned income of $287 million. As of December 31, 2014, Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $361 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia subject to long-term leases, which represented the estimated residual
value of leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms of $685 million, less unearned income of $324 million. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the lease terms. If the lessee does not
exercise the fixed purchase options, Exelon has the ability to operate the stations and keep or market the power itself or require the lessee to arrange for a third-party to bid on a service contract for a period following the lease term. Exelon
will be subject to residual value risk if the lessee does not exercise the fixed purchase options. This risk is partially mitigated by the fair value of the scheduled payments under the service contract. However, such payments are not guaranteed.
Further, the term of the service contract is less than the expected remaining useful life of the plants and, therefore, Exelon s exposure to residual value risk will not be mitigated by payments under the service contract in this remaining
period. Lessee performance under the lease agreements is supported by collateral and credit enhancement measures. Management regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of Exelon s counterparties to these long-term leases. Exelon monitors the
continuing credit quality of the credit enhancement party.         
  Pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance, Exelon is required to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments
at least annually and, if the review indicates a fair value below the carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary, must record an impairment charge in the period the estimate changed. Based on the annual review performed
in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014, the estimated residual value of Exelon s direct financing leases for the Georgia generating stations experienced other than temporary declines given increases in estimated long-term operating and
maintenance costs in the 2015 annual review and reduced long-term energy and capacity price expectations in the 2014 annual review. As a result, Exelon recorded a $24 million pre-tax impairment charge in 2015 and 2014 for these stations. See Note
8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
   Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt
to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may
utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At December 31, 2015, Exelon had
$800 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and Exelon and Generation had $738 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges are 100%
effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in approximately a $6 million decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax
income for the year ended December 31, 2015. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically
designated as economic hedges.

    Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)    
        Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to
fund certain costs of decommissioning Generation s nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2015, Generation s decommissioning trust funds are reflected at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust
funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity
markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with
Generation s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a $454 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables
constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of equity price risk as a result
of the current capital and credit market conditions.

  Generation s business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. Generation s capital resources are primarily
provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper, participation in the intercompany money pool or capital contributions from
Exelon. Generation s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to where Generation no
longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Generation has access to credit facilities in the aggregate of $5.7 billion that Generation currently utilizes to support its commercial paper program and to issue letters of credit.

Operations  of this Form 10-K.             Liquidity and Capital Resources
            PECO s business is capital intensive and requires
considerable capital resources. PECO s capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper or
participation in the intercompany money pool. PECO s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions
deteriorate to where PECO no longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, PECO has access to a revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015, PECO had access to a revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of
$600 million. See the  Credit Matters  section of  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for additional discussion.         
  Capital resources are used primarily to fund PECO s capital requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, the payment of dividends
and contributions to Exelon s pension plans. Additionally, PECO operates in a rate-regulated environment in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time.

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         
  Exelon s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
assessment, Exelon s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, Exelon s internal control over financial reporting was effective.         
  The effectiveness of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, has been audited by

        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Exelon Corporation (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.         
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
           Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of

        To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company:
           In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.         
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
           Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.            /s/

        The notes to the consolidated financial statements that follow are a
combined presentation. The following list indicates the registrants to which the footnotes apply:             Applicable Notes          
             1. Significant Accounting
Policies (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Description of
Business (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Exelon is a utility services holding company engaged through its principal subsidiaries in the energy generation and energy delivery businesses. On
April 1, 2014, Generation assumed the operating licenses and corresponding operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, Exelon and Generation consolidated CENG s financial position and results of operations into their
businesses. Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for CENG as an equity method investment. Refer to Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for further information regarding the integration
transaction.            The energy generation business includes:

Generation : Physical delivery and marketing of owned and contracted electric generation capacity and provision of renewable and other energy-related
products and services, and natural gas exploration and production activities. Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions.      
        The energy delivery businesses include:   

ComEd : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in northern Illinois, including the
City of Chicago.            

PECO : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in southeastern Pennsylvania,
including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.      

BGE : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in central Maryland, including the City
of Baltimore, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.                Basis of Presentation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             This is a combined annual report of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements apply to Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE as   
         230

indicated above in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO
and BGE are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures.            Each of the Registrant s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. As a result of the Registrants  2014 divestiture
of certain unconsolidated affiliates considered integral to their operations and the consolidation of CENG during 2014, all Equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates have been presented below Income taxes in the Registrants 
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income starting in the first quarter of 2015.         
  Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human
resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. The costs of BSC, including support services, are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries using a cost-causative allocation method. Corporate
governance-type costs that cannot be directly assigned are allocated based on a Modified Massachusetts Formula, which is a method that utilizes a combination of gross revenues, total assets and direct labor costs for the allocation base. The results
of Exelon s corporate operations are presented as  Other  within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.            Exelon owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for ComEd, of
which Exelon owns more than 99%, and BGE, of which Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of BGE s preference stock. Exelon owned none of PECO s preferred securities, which PECO redeemed in 2013. Exelon has reflected the third-party
interests in ComEd, which totaled less than $1 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, as equity, PECO s preferred securities as preferred securities of subsidiary through their redemption in 2013, and BGE s
preference stock as BGE preference stock not subject to mandatory redemption in its consolidated financial statements. BGE is subject to some ring-fencing measures established by order of the MDPSC. As part of this arrangement, BGE common stock is
held directly by RF Holdco LLC, which is an indirect subsidiary of Exelon. GSS Holdings (BGE Utility), an unrelated party, holds a nominal non-economic interest in RF Holdco LLC with limited voting rights on specified matters.   
        Generation owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated
subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for certain Exelon Wind projects, of which Generation holds a majority interest of 99% for certain periods of time, and CENG, of which Generation holds a 50.01% interest. The remaining interests
are included in noncontrolling interest on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for further discussion of Exelon s and Generation s VIEs and the reversionary interests
of the noncontrolling members for these certain subsidiaries.         
  ComEd owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for RITELine Illinois, LLC, of which
ComEd owns 75% and an additional 12.5% is indirectly owned by Exelon. Exelon and ComEd have reflected the third-party interests of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, in RITELine Illinois, LLC, which both totaled less than $1 million at December 31,
2015 and December 31, 2014, as equity.            Exelon
consolidates the accounts of entities in which Exelon has a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. A controlling financial interest is evidenced by either a voting interest greater than 50% in which
Exelon can exercise control over the operations and   
         231

policies of the investee, or the results of a model that identifies Exelon or one of its subsidiaries as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Where Exelon does not have a controlling financial
interest in an entity, it applies proportionate consolidation, equity method accounting or cost method accounting. Exelon applies proportionate consolidation when it has an undivided interest in an asset and is proportionately liable for its share
of each liability associated with the asset. Exelon proportionately consolidates its undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities, as well as its undivided ownership interests in Upstream natural gas
exploration and production activities. Under proportionate consolidation, Exelon separately records its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. Exelon applies equity
method accounting when it has significant influence over an investee through an ownership in common stock, which generally approximates a 20% to 50% voting interest. Exelon applies equity method accounting to certain investments and joint ventures,
including certain financing trusts of ComEd, PECO, and BGE. Under the equity method, Exelon reports its interest in the entity as an investment and Exelon s percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in its financial
statements. Exelon uses the cost method if it holds less than 20% of the common stock of an entity. Under the cost method, Exelon reports its investment at cost and recognizes income only to the extent Exelon receives dividends or distributions.
           The accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.   
         Use of Estimates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and other postretirement benefits, the application of purchase accounting, inventory reserves, allowance for uncollectible accounts, goodwill and asset impairments, derivative
instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
         Reclassifications (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Certain prior year amounts in the registrants  Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been reclassified between line items for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect any of the
Registrants  net income, financial positions, or cash flows from operating activities.            Exelon revised the presentation on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for PECO and BGE to reflect separately operating revenues from the sale of electricity and operating revenues from the sale
of natural gas, as well as, purchased power expense and purchased fuel expense within the operating expenses section of the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Further, Exelon revised the presentation from total operating revenues to
 Rate-regulated utility revenues  and  Competitive businesses revenues  on the face of Exelon s consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. Similarly, Exelon will separately
present rate-regulated purchased power and fuel expense and non-rate regulated   
         232

purchased power and fuel expense on the face of Exelon s consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. The reclassifications described herein were
made for presentation purposes and did not affect any of the Registrants  total revenues or net income.             Accounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires ComEd, PECO and BGE to
record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: 1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are
designed to recover the entities  cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities  costs from customers. Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE account
for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, the PAPUC, and the MDPSC, in the cases of ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, under state
public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund
included in customer rates. Exelon believes that it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. However, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE continue to evaluate
their respective abilities to apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, including consideration of current events in their respective regulatory and political environments. If a separable portion of
ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion,
which could have a material impact on their results of operations and financial positions. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.         
  The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements
as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.   
         Revenues (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues are recorded as
service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers. ComEd records its best estimates of the distribution
and transmission revenue impacts resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE records its best estimate of the transmission revenue impact
resulting from changes in rates that BGE believes are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanism. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 6 Accounts Receivable for further information.  
               RTOs and ISOs.   In RTO and ISO markets
that facilitate the dispatch of energy and energy-related products, the Registrants generally report sales and purchases conducted on a net hourly basis in either revenues or purchased power on their Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income, the classification of which depends on the net hourly activity. In addition, capacity revenue and expense classification is based on the net sale or purchase position of the Company in the different RTOs and ISOs.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Option Contracts, Swaps and Commodity Derivatives.   Certain option contracts and swap
arrangements that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction.
For example, gas transactions may be used to hedge the sale of power. This will result in the change in fair value recorded through revenue. As ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, ComEd
records the fair value of its energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments for further information.             
    Proprietary Trading Activities.   Exelon and Generation account for Generation s trading activities under the provisions of the
authoritative guidance for accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities, which require energy revenues and costs related to energy trading contracts to be presented on a net basis in the income statement.
Commodity derivatives used for trading purposes are accounted for using the mark-to-market method with unrealized gains and losses recognized in operating revenues. Refer to Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for further
information.                 Income Taxes (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO
and BGE)             Deferred Federal and state income taxes are
provided on all significant temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets
and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a
more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that
the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.
The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense or Other income and deductions (interest income) on their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
        Pursuant to the IRC and relevant state taxing authorities, Exelon and
its subsidiaries file consolidated or combined income tax returns for Federal and certain state jurisdictions where allowed or required. See Note 15 Income Taxes for further information.             Taxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE collect certain taxes from
customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges, and fees that are levied by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of gas and electricity. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but
paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are   
         234

reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. See Note 24 Supplemental Financial Information for
Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s utility taxes that are presented on a gross basis.             Cash and Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   
         Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds
that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon Corporate s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented restricted funds for payment of medical, dental, vision and
long-term disability benefits. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Generation s restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily included cash at Antelope Valley required for debt service and construction and cash at Continental
Wind and ExGen Texas Power, which is required for debt service and financing of operation and maintenance of the underlying entities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd s restricted cash primarily represented cash collateral held from
suppliers associated with ComEd s energy and REC procurement contracts. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, PECO s restricted cash primarily represented funds from the sales of assets that were subject to PECO s mortgage indenture.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, BGE s restricted cash primarily represented funds restricted at its consolidated variable interest entity for repayment of rate stabilization bonds and cash collateral held from suppliers.   
        Restricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current
liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon s and Generation s NDT funds, which are designated to satisfy future decommissioning obligations, were classified as noncurrent assets. As of
December 31, 2015, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE had investments in Rabbi trusts classified as noncurrent assets.         
   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the
Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging, historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd, PECO and BGE estimate the
allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar
credit quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage
of accounts receivable in each risk segment. ComEd, PECO and BGE customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. ComEd,
PECO and BGE customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic
conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC regulations, respectively. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of uncollectible accounts receivable at ComEd.

    Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon accounts for its investments in and arrangements with VIEs
based on the authoritative guidance which includes the following specific requirements:         

requires an entity to qualitatively assess whether it should consolidate a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most
significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,      

requires an ongoing reconsideration of this assessment instead of only upon certain triggering events, and      

requires the entity that consolidates a VIE (the primary beneficiary) to disclose (1) the assets of the consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle
specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (2) the liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.      
        Based on the above accounting guidance, Exelon has adopted the
following policies related to variable interest entities:         

Exelon has disclosed, to the extent material, the assets of its consolidated VIEs that can only be used to settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE,
and the liabilities of Exelon s consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to Exelon s general credit.            

Exelon has qualitatively assessed whether the equity holders of the entity have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the entity.
              See Note 2 Variable Interest
Entities for additional information.             Inventories (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Inventory is recorded at the
lower of weighted average cost or market. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory.         
    Fossil Fuel.   Fossil fuel inventory includes the weighted average costs of stored natural gas, propane and oil. The costs of natural
gas, propane and oil are generally included in inventory when purchased and charged to fuel expense when used or sold.             
    Materials and Supplies.   Materials and supplies inventory generally includes the weighted average costs of transmission, distribution
and generating plant materials. Materials are generally charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.       
          Emission Allowances.   Emission allowances are included in
inventory (for emission allowances exercisable in the current year) and other deferred debits (for emission allowances that are exercisable beyond one year) and are carried at the lower of weighted average cost or market and charged to fuel expense
as they are used in operations.                 Marketable Securities
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             All
marketable securities are reported at fair value. Marketable securities held in the NDT funds are classified as trading securities and all other securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the Regulatory Agreement Units are included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd and
PECO and in noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in noncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the Non-Regulatory
Agreement Units are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, for Exelon s available-for-sale securities are reported in OCI. Any decline in the fair value of Exelon s available-for-sale
securities below the cost basis is reviewed to determine if such decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the available-for-sale securities is written down to fair value as a new
cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in earnings. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for information regarding marketable securities held by NDT funds and Note 24 Supplemental Financial Information for additional
information regarding ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets and liabilities.             Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs. ComEd, PECO
and BGE also include indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes capitalized interest for Generation and Exelon
Corporate and AFUDC for regulated property at ComEd, PECO and BGE. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to maintenance expense as incurred.   
        Third parties reimburse ComEd, PECO and BGE for all or a portion of
expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, Plant and Equipment. DOE SGIG funds reimbursed to PECO and BGE have been accounted for as CIAC.   
        For Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is charged to
accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly-installed
asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.   
        For ComEd, PECO and BGE, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of
salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. ComEd s and BGE s depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement,
which is consistent with each utility s regulatory recovery method. ComEd s and BGE s actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability. PECO s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated
depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO s regulatory recovery method.   
        Generation s oil and gas exploration and production activities
consist of working interests in gas producing fields. Generation accounts for these activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Acquisition, development and exploration costs are capitalized. Costs of drilling exploratory wells are
initially capitalized and later charged to expense if reserves are not discovered or deemed not to be commercially viable. Other exploratory costs are charged to expense when incurred.

   See Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 10 Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
and Note 24 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment.         
   Nuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)          
  The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method. Prior
to May 16, 2014, the estimated disposal cost of SNF was established per the Standard Waste Contract with the DOE and was expensed through fuel expense at one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation. Effective May 16, 2014, the SNF
disposal fee was set to zero by the DOE and Exelon and Generation are not accruing any further costs related to SNF disposal fees until a new fee structure goes into effect. On-site SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a DOE (or
government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the SNF disposal fee.   
         Nuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)    
        Costs associated with nuclear outages, including planned major
maintenance activities, are expensed to operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment (based on the nature of the activities) in the period incurred.             New Site Development Costs (Exelon and Generation)    
        New site development costs represent the costs incurred in the
assessment and design of new power generating facilities. Such costs are capitalized when management considers project completion to be probable, primarily based on management s determination that the project is economically and operationally
feasible, management and/or the Exelon board of directors has approved the project and has committed to a plan to develop it, and Exelon and Generation have received the required regulatory approvals or management believes the receipt of required
regulatory approvals is probable. Capitalized development costs are charged to Operating and maintenance expense when project completion is no longer probable. New site development costs incurred prior to a project s completion being deemed
probable are expensed as incurred. Approximately $22 million, $13 million and $10 million of costs were expensed by Exelon and Generation for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These costs are related to the
possible development of new power generating facilities.

    Capitalized Software Costs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Costs incurred during the application development stage of software
projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within property, plant, and equipment. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational,
generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements. The following table presents net unamortized capitalized
software costs and amortization of capitalized software costs by year:         
           Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Except for the
amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis using the composite method. ComEd s and BGE s depreciation includes a provision for
estimated removal costs as authorized by the respective regulators. The estimated service lives for ComEd, PECO and BGE are primarily based on the average service lives from the most recent depreciation study for each respective company. The
estimated service lives of the nuclear-fuel generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year license renewal extension of the operating licenses (to the extent that such renewal has not yet been
granted) for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. The estimated service lives of the hydroelectric generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a
license renewal extension of the operating licenses. The estimated service lives of the fossil fuel and other renewable generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which Generation periodically evaluates based on
feasibility assessments taking into account economic and capital requirement considerations.            See Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment for further information regarding depreciation.         
  Depletion of oil and gas exploration and production activities is recorded using the units-of-production method over the remaining life of the
estimated proved reserves at the field level for acquisition costs and over the remaining life of proved developed reserves at the field level for development costs. The estimates for oil and gas reserves are based on internal calculations.
           Amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are
recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would
have originally been recorded in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd s distribution formula rate regulatory asset and ComEd s and BGE s transmission formula rate
regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues.

Amortization of income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities is generally recorded to Income tax expense. With the exception of the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed above, when
the recovery period is more than one year, the amortization is generally recorded to Depreciation and amortization in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
        See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 24 Supplemental
Financial Information for additional information regarding Generation s nuclear fuel, Generation s ARC and the amortization of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s regulatory assets.   
         Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            The authoritative guidance for accounting for AROs
requires the recognition of a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even though the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its
nuclear generating stations, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning
cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Generation generally updates its ARO annually during the third quarter, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost
studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years
unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates (such as a change in assumed operating life for a nuclear plant). As part of the annual cost study update process, Generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously
assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle. The liabilities
associated with Exelon s non-nuclear AROs are adjusted on an ongoing rotational basis, at least once every five years. Changes to the recorded value of an ARO result from the passage of new laws and regulations, revisions to either the timing
or amount of estimates of undiscounted cash flows, and estimates of cost escalation factors. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to Operating and maintenance
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or, in the case of the majority of ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s accretion, through an increase to regulatory assets. See Note 16 Asset Retirement
Obligations for additional information.             Capitalized Interest and AFUDC
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             During
construction, Exelon and Generation capitalize the costs of debt funds used to finance non-regulated construction projects. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to interest
expense.            Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE apply the
authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation to calculate AFUDC, which is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is
recorded to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to AFUDC that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed
under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities.   
         240

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following table summarizes total incurred interest, capitalized interest and credits to AFUDC
by year:         

(a)  
  On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, the 2014 financial results include CENG s financial position and
results of operations beginning April 1, 2014.     

(b)  
  Includes interest expense to affiliates.           
   Guarantees (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing
the guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur.         
  The liability that is initially recognized at the inception of the guarantee is reduced as the Registrants are released from risk under the
guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the
guarantee. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.             Asset Impairments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
    Long-Lived Assets.   The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of their long-lived assets or asset groups, excluding goodwill, when
circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific
regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows
to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or
asset group over its fair value less costs to sell.                Cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The cash flows from
the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level along with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet. In certain cases, generating assets   
         241

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generation assets (typically contracted
renewables). See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.              Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not
amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note
11 Intangible Assets for additional information regarding Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s goodwill.             
    Equity Method Investments.   Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they
are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature. Additionally, if the project in which Generation holds an investment recognizes an impairment loss, Exelon and
Generation would record their proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.       
          Debt and Equity Security Investments.   Exelon and
Generation regularly monitor and evaluate debt and equity investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.  
               Direct Financing Lease Investments.  
Direct financing lease investments represent the estimated residual values of leased coal-fired plants in Georgia. Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records an impairment charge if the review
indicates an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.       
         Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at
their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Additionally, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of the fair value
of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge) or hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the
change in the cost or value of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings
immediately. For derivative contracts intended to serve as economic hedges and that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales exception, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are
recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in revenue, purchased power and fuel, interest expense or other, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations based on the activity the transaction is economically
hedging. For energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, which are subject to Exelon s Risk Management Policy, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. All amounts
classified in earnings related to proprietary trading are included in revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing
cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction.   
         242

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   For commodity derivative contracts Generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the
cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to the Constellation merger. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remained probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges
was frozen in accumulated OCI and was reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurred through March 31, 2015. The effect of this decision is that all derivatives executed to hedge economic
risk related to commodities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings for the combined company.         
  As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its
customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity.
Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and will not be financially settled. Revenues and
expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they
are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.             Retirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all Generation,
ComEd, PECO, BGE and BSC employees.            The measurement of the
plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The
impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Gains or losses in excess of the
greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits for additional discussion of
Exelon s accounting for retirement benefits.             Equity Investment
Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates (Exelon and Generation)             Exelon and Generation include equity in earnings from equity method investments in qualifying facilities, power projects and joint ventures, in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates within their
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates also includes any adjustments to amortize the difference, if any, except for goodwill and land, between their cost in an equity
method investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment.         
  Exelon and Generation continuously monitor for issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these equity method investments and
which could result in the recognition of an impairment loss if such investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value.         
   New Accounting Pronouncements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon has identified the following new accounting standards that have
been recently adopted that management believes may significantly affect the Registrants.

     Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes     
        In November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
guidance can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Registrants early adopted the standard retrospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in the following impacts as of December 31, 2014 in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets of the Registrants:         
          The adoption of this guidance had no
impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.         
    Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments     
        In September 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and to record, in the same
period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the
acquisition date. Under current guidance, such effects would be retrospectively recorded in prior periods. The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance is required to be applied prospectively to
adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Registrants early adopted the standard in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adoption of
this guidance had no impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.   
          Application of Normal Purchases Normal Sales Exception to Power
Contracts in Nodal Energy Markets              In August 2015,
the FASB issued authoritative guidance addressing the ability of entities to elect the normal purchase normal sales (NPNS) scope exception when the contract for the purchase or sale of electricity on a forward basis is delivered to a nodal energy
market or transmitted through a nodal energy market. The NPNS scope exception allows entities to treat certain contracts that qualify as derivatives as contracts that do not require recognition at fair value. The guidance specifies that the use of
locational marginal pricing by an independent system operator in such transactions does not constitute net settlement of a contract for the purchase or sale of electricity, even in scenarios in which legal title to the associated electricity is
conveyed to the independent system operator during transmission. Consequently, the use of locational marginal pricing by the independent system operator does not cause that contract to fail to meet the physical delivery criterion of the NPNS scope
exception. Consistent with the Registrants  current practice, if the physical delivery criterion is met, along with all of the other criteria of the NPNS scope exception, an entity may elect to designate that contract as

NPNS. The guidance is effective upon issuance and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.         
    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs     
        In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the
presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new guidance requires entities to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct reduction to the related debt liability rather than as a deferred cost (i.e., an asset) as
required by current guidance. The new guidance does not change the recognition or measurement of debt issuance costs. The guidance is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted
for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Registrants early adopted the standard retrospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015. The
adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of $157 million, $70 million, $34 million, $14 million, and $16 million as of December 31, 2014, from Other long-term assets to Long-term debt, including Long-term debt to financing
trusts, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. The standard did not impact the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the
Registrants.            In August 2015, the FASB issued clarifying
authoritative guidance for debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. The guidance states that an entity should defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance
costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows and disclosures.            The following recently
issued accounting standards are not yet required to be reflected in the combined financial statements of the Registrants.         
    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities              In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which (i) requires all investments in equity securities,
including other ownership interests such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies, to be carried at fair value through net income, (ii) requires an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related
to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, (iii) amends several disclosure requirements, including the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value or
a description of the changes in the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value, and (iv) requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost at the amount that would be received to sell
the asset or paid to transfer the liability. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment
to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of adoption (modified retrospective method). The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the potential to early adopt the guidance.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory     
        In July 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires
inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The new guidance defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and
transportation. This definition is consistent with existing authoritative guidance. Current guidance requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable
value less an approximately normal profit margin. The guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied prospectively. The Registrants do not expect that
this guidance will have a significant impact on their Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures. The Registrants are currently assessing the
potential to early adopt the guidance.              Disclosures
for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share              In May 2015, FASB issued authoritative guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share
practical expedient. Investments measured at net asset value per share using the practical expedient will be presented as a reconciling item between the fair value hierarchy disclosure and the investment line item on the statement of financial
position. The guidance also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to
investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using the practical expedient. The guidance is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The guidance
is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their disclosures. There will be no impact to the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets,
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.         
    Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement              In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the circumstances under which a cloud computing
customer would account for the arrangement as a license of internal-use software. A cloud computing arrangement would include a software license if (1) the customer has a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during
the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. If the arrangement does not
contain a software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Registrants will apply the standard prospectively and do not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on their
Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures.         
    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis           
  In February 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends the consolidation analysis for variable interest entities (VIEs) as well as
voting interest entities. The new guidance primarily (1) changes the assessment of limited partnerships as VIEs, (2) amends the effect that fees paid to a decision maker or service provider have on the VIE analysis, (3) amends how
variable interests held by   
         246

a reporting entity s related parties and de facto agents impact its consolidation conclusion, (4) clarifies how to determine whether equity holders (as a group) have power over an
entity, and (5) provides a scope exception for registered and similar unregistered money market funds. The guidance is effective for the Registrants for the first interim period beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The guidance can be
applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of adoption (modified
retrospective method). The Registrants are in the process of evaluating the standard and have not identified any changes to consolidation conclusions as a result of the new guidance and therefore have not elected an adoption method. Based on the
analysis completed to date, a limited number of additional entities will be considered variable interest entities when the guidance is adopted, and required disclosures will be included in the Variable Interest Entities footnote.   
          Revenue from Contracts with Customers     
        In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the
criteria for recognizing revenue from a contract with a customer. The new standard replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition, including most industry specific guidance, with a five step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from
contracts with customers. The objective of the new standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries and across capital markets.
The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires a
number of disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows. The guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively
with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of initial adoption (modified retrospective method). The Registrants are currently assessing the impacts this guidance may have on their
Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and disclosures as well as the transition method that they will use to adopt the guidance. Exelon is considering the
impacts of the new guidance on our ability to recognize revenue for certain contracts where collectability is in question, our accounting for contributions in aid of construction, bundled sales contracts and contracts with pricing provisions that
may require us to recognize revenue at prices other than the contract price (e.g., straight line or forward curve). In addition, the Registrants will be required to capitalize costs to acquire new contracts, whereas Exelon currently expenses those
costs as incurred. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to provide a one year deferral of the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, as well as an option to early adopt the standard for
annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Registrants do not plan to early adopt the standard.         
     2. Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             A VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to
finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity owners who do not have the obligation to
absorb expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary, which is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that
most significantly affect the entity s economic performance.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon, Generation, and BGE collectively consolidated seven
and six VIEs or VIE groups, respectively, for which the applicable Registrant was the primary beneficiary ( see Consolidated Variable Interest Entities below) . As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Registrants had significant interests in
eight and six other VIEs, respectively, for which the Registrants do not have the power to direct the entities  activities and, accordingly, were not the primary beneficiary ( see Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities below) .
             Consolidated Variable Interest Entities     
        The carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs 
assets and liabilities included in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:         

(a)  
  Certain December 31, 2014 balances have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance related to classification of deferred taxes and simplifying the presentation of
debt costs. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.     

(b)  
  Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the BGE standalone entity.     
        Except as specifically noted below, the assets in the table above are
restricted for settlement of the VIE obligations and the liabilities in the table can only be settled using VIE resources.         
  Exelon s, Generation s and BGE s consolidated VIEs consist of:   
         RSB BondCo LLC.  In 2007, BGE formed RSB BondCo LLC (BondCo), a
special purpose bankruptcy remote limited liability company, to acquire and hold rate stabilization property and to issue and service bonds secured by the rate stabilization property. In June 2007, BondCo purchased rate stabilization property from
BGE, including the right to assess, collect, and receive non-bypassable rate stabilization charges payable by all residential electric customers of BGE. These charges are being assessed in order to recover previously incurred power purchase costs
that BGE deferred pursuant to Senate Bill 1. BGE has determined that BondCo is a VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary. As a result, BGE consolidates BondCo.     
        BondCo s assets are restricted and can only be used to settle the
obligations of BondCo. Further, BGE is required to remit all payments it receives from customers for rate stabilization charges to BondCo. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, BGE remitted $86 million, $85 million, and $83 million, respectively, to BondCo.
           BGE did not provide any additional financial support to
BondCo during 2015. Further, BGE does not have any contractual commitments or obligations to provide additional financial support to BondCo unless additional rate stabilization bonds are issued. The BondCo creditors do not have any recourse to the
general credit of BGE in the event the rate stabilization charges are not sufficient to cover the bond principal and interest payments of BondCo.

    Retail Gas Group.  During 2009, Constellation formed two new entities, which now are part of
Generation, and combined them with its existing retail gas activities into a retail gas entity group for the purpose of entering   into a collateralized gas supply agreement with a third-party gas supplier. While Generation owns 100% of these
entities, it has been determined that the retail gas entity group is a VIE because there is not sufficient equity to fund the group s activities without the additional credit support that is provided in the form of a parental guarantee.
Generation is the primary beneficiary of the retail gas entity group; accordingly, Generation consolidates the retail gas entity group as a VIE.           
  The third-party gas supply arrangement is collateralized as follows:   

the assets of the retail gas entity group must be used to settle obligations under the third-party gas supply agreement before it can make any distributions to
Generation,            

the third-party gas supplier has a collateral interest in all of the assets and equity of the retail gas entity group, and      

Generation provides a $75 million parental guarantee to the third-party gas supplier in support of the retail gas entity group.      
        Other than credit support provided by the parental guarantee, Exelon or
Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support under the collateralized third-party gas supply agreement. The third-party gas supply creditors do not have any recourse to Exelon s or
Generation s general credit other than the parental guarantee.             Solar Project Entity Group.  In 2011, Generation acquired all of the equity interests in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (Antelope Valley) from First Solar, Inc., a 242-MW solar PV project in northern Los
Angeles County, California. In addition, Generation owns a number of limited liability companies that build, own, and operate solar power facilities. While Generation owns 100% of these entities, it has been determined that certain of the individual
solar project entities are VIEs because the entities require additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental guarantee of debt, loans from the customers in order to obtain the necessary funds for construction of the solar
facilities, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the solar project entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation
controls the design, construction, and operation of the solar power facilities. Generation provides operating and capital funding to the solar entities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance of the solar power facilities and provides
limited recourse related to the Antelope Valley project. In addition, these solar VIE entities have an aggregate amount of outstanding debt with third parties of $655 million, as of December 31, 2015, for which the creditors have no recourse to
Generation. For additional information on these project-specific financing arrangements refer to Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements.           
   Retail Power and Gas Companies.  In March 2014, Generation began consolidating retail power and gas VIEs for which Generation is the primary
beneficiary as a result of energy supply contracts that give Generation the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the entities. Generation does not have an equity ownership interest in these
entities, but provides approximately $12 million in credit support for the retail power and gas companies. These entities are included in Generation s consolidated financial statements, and the consolidation of the VIEs do not have a material
impact on Generation s financial results or financial condition.               Wind Project Entity Group . Generation owns and operates a number of wind project limited liability entities, the majority of which were acquired during 2010 with the acquisition of all of the equity

 interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind). Generation has evaluated the significant agreements and ownership structures and the risks of each of its wind projects and
underlying entities, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs because either the projects have noncontrolling equity interest holders that absorb variability from the wind projects, or the customers absorb price variability from the
entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the   wind project entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the wind
generation facilities. While Generation owns 100% of the majority of the wind project entities, nine of the projects have noncontrolling equity interests of 1% held by third parties. Generation s current economic interests in eight of these
projects is significantly greater than its stated contractual governance rights and all of these projects have reversionary interest provisions that provide the noncontrolling interest holder with a purchase option, certain of which are considered
bargain purchase prices, which, if exercised, transfers ownership of the projects to the noncontrolling interest holder upon either the passage of time or the achievement of targeted financial returns. The ownership agreements with the
noncontrolling interests state that Generation is to provide financial support to the projects in proportion to its current 99% economic interests in the projects. However, no additional support to these projects beyond what was contractually
required has been provided during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are consolidated as a result of Generation being the primary beneficiary of the wind VIE entities primarily relates to the
wind generating assets, PPA intangible assets and working capital amounts.               Other Generating Facilities.  During the second quarter of 2015, Generation formed a limited liability company to build, own, and operate a backup generator. While Generation owns 100% of the backup generator
company, it was determined that the entity is a VIE because the customer absorbs price variability from the entity through the fixed price backup generator agreement. Generation provides operating and capital funding to the backup generator company.
Generation also owns 90% of a biomass fueled, combined heat and power company. In the second quarter of 2015, the entity was deemed to be a VIE because the entity requires additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental guarantee
provided by Generation for up to $275 million in support of the payment obligations related to the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the facility (see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional details on Albany
Green Energy, LLC). In addition to the parental guarantee, Generation provides operating and capital funding to the biomass fueled, combined heat and power company. Generation is the primary beneficiary of both entities since Generation has the
power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the entities.            
   CENG.  Through March 31, 2014, CENG was operated as a joint venture with EDF and was governed by a board of ten directors, five of which
were appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG was designed to operate under joint and equal control of Generation and EDF through the Board of Directors, subject to the Chairman of the Board s final decision making authority on certain
special matters; therefore, CENG was not subject to VIE guidance. Accordingly, Generation s 50.01% interest in CENG was accounted for as an equity method investment. On April 1, 2014, Generation, CENG, and subsidiaries of CENG executed the
Nuclear Operating Services Agreement (NOSA) pursuant to which Generation now conducts all activities associated with the operations of the CENG fleet and provides corporate and administrative services to CENG and the CENG fleet for the remaining
life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the CENG member rights of EDF. As a result of executing the NOSA, CENG now qualifies as a VIE due to the disproportionate relationship between
Generation s 50.01% equity ownership interest and its role in conducting the operational activities of CENG and the   CENG fleet conveyed through the NOSA.     
         250

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) (Continued)    

Further, since Generation is conducting the operational activities of CENG and the CENG fleet, Generation qualifies as the primary beneficiary of CENG and, therefore, is required to
consolidate the financial position and results of operations of CENG. On April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation derecognized Generation s equity method investment in CENG and reflected all assets, liabilities, and the EDF noncontrolling
interest in CENG at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets of Exelon and Generation, resulting in the recognition of a $261 million gain in their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended
December 31, 2014. For additional information on this transaction refer to Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC.           
  Generation and Exelon, where indicated, provide the following support to CENG (See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC
and Note 26 Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding Generation and Exelon s transactions with CENG):         

under the NOSA, Generation conducts all activities related to the operation of the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries (the CENG fleet) and
provides corporate and administrative services for the remaining life and decommissioning of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the CENG member rights of EDF,      

under the Power Services Agency Agreement (PSAA), Generation provides scheduling, asset management, and billing services to the CENG fleet for the remaining
operating life of the CENG nuclear plants,            

under power purchase agreements with CENG, Generation purchased or will purchase 50.01% of the available output generated by the CENG nuclear plants not subject
to other contractual agreements from January 2015 through the end of the operating life of each respective plant. However, pursuant to amendments dated March 31, 2015, the energy obligations under the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant (Ginna) PPAs have
been suspended during the term of the expected Reliability Support Services Agreement (RSSA). (see Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional details),      

Generation provided a $400 million loan to CENG. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining obligation is $300 million including accrued interest, which
reflects the principal payment made in January 2015 (see Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for more details),            

Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear
incident (as defined in the Price Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this Indemnity Agreement. (See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for more
details),            

in connection with CENG s severance obligations, Generation has agreed to reimburse CENG for a total of approximately $6 million of the severance benefits
paid or to be paid in 2014 through 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining obligation is approximately $1 million,            

Generation and EDF share in the $637 million of contingent payment obligations for the payment of contingent retrospective premium adjustments for the nuclear
liability insurance (See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for more details),            

Generation provides a guarantee of approximately $7 million associated with hazardous waste management facilities and underground storage tanks. In addition, EDF
executed a reimbursement agreement that provides reimbursement to Exelon for 49.99% of any amounts paid by Generation under this guarantee,      
         251

Generation and EDF are the members-insured with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited and have assigned the loss benefits under the insurance and the NEIL premium
costs to CENG and guarantee the obligations of CENG under these insurance programs in proportion to their respective member interests (see Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for more details), and      

Exelon has executed an agreement to provide up to $245 million to support the operations of CENG as well as a $165 million guarantee of CENG s cash pooling
agreement with its subsidiaries.               For each
of the consolidated VIEs, except as otherwise noted:         

the assets of the VIEs are restricted and can only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE;      

Exelon, Generation and BGE did not provide any additional material financial support to the VIEs;      

Exelon, Generation and BGE did not have any material contractual commitments or obligations to provide financial support to the VIEs; and

the creditors of the VIEs did not have recourse to Exelon s, Generation s or BGE s general credit.      
        As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd and PECO did not have any
material consolidated VIEs.

    Assets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs             Included within the balances above are assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs for which the assets can only
be used to settle obligations of those VIEs, and liabilities that creditors, or beneficiaries, do not have recourse to the general credit of the Registrants. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, these assets and liabilities primarily consisted of
the following:         

(a)  
  Certain December 31, 2014 balances have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance related to classification of deferred taxes and simplifying the presentation of
debt costs. See Note 1- Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.     

(b)  
  Includes the CNEG retail gas pension obligation, which is presented as a net asset balance within the Prepaid pension asset line item on Generation s balance sheet. See Note

    Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities             Exelon s and Generation s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs generally include equity investments and
energy purchase and sale contracts. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is reflected on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments. For the energy purchase and sale contracts
(commercial agreements), the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with the VIEs are predominately related to working capital accounts and
generally represent the amounts owed by, or owed to, Exelon and Generation for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements. Further, Exelon and Generation have not provided material debt or equity
support, liquidity arrangements or performance guarantees associated with these commercial agreements.         
  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon and Generation had significant unconsolidated variable interests in eight and six VIEs, respectively,
for which Exelon or Generation, as applicable, was not the primary beneficiary; including certain equity method investments and certain commercial agreements. The increase in the number of unconsolidated VIEs is due to the execution of an energy
purchase and sale agreement with a new unconsolidated VIE and an equity investment in a new unconsolidated VIE.         
  The following tables present summary information about Exelon and Generation s significant unconsolidated VIE entities:   

(a)  
  These items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not on Exelon s or Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These items are included to provide
information regarding the relative size of the unconsolidated VIEs. Exelon corrected an error in the December 31, 2014 balances within Commercial Agreement VIEs for an overstatement of Total assets, Total liabilities and Other ownership
interests in VIE of $392 million, $234 million and $158 million, respectively. The error is not considered material to any prior period.

as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These items are included to provide information regarding the relative size of the ZionSolutions LLC unconsolidated VIE.     
        For each unconsolidated VIE, Exelon and Generation assessed the risk of
a loss equal to their maximum exposure to be remote and, accordingly Exelon and Generation have not recognized a liability associated with any portion of the maximum exposure to loss. In addition, there are no agreements with, or commitments by,
third parties that would materially affect the fair value or risk of their variable interests in these variable interest entities.         
   Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Generation has several energy purchase and sale agreements with generating facilities. Generation has
evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structures and risks of each entity, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs because the entity absorbs risk through the sale of fixed price power and renewable energy credits. Generation
has reviewed the entities and has determined that Generation is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. 
             ZionSolutions . Generation has an asset sale
agreement with EnergySolutions, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions), which is further discussed in Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this agreement, ZionSolutions can put the assets and
liabilities back to Generation when decommissioning activities under the asset sale agreement are complete. Generation has evaluated this agreement and determined that, through the put option, it has a variable interest in ZionSolutions but is not
the primary beneficiary. As a result, Generation has concluded that consolidation is not required. Other than the asset sale agreement, Exelon and Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support
and ZionSolutions  creditors do not have any recourse to Exelon s or Generation s general credit.         
   Investment in Energy Development Projects, Distributed Energy Companies, and Energy Generating Facilities.  Generation has several equity
investments in energy development projects and energy generating facilities. Generation has evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structures and risks of each of its equity investments, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs
because the entity has an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, Generation guarantees the debt of the entity, provides equity support, or provides operating services to the entity. Generation has reviewed the entities and
has determined that Generation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance.     
        In July 2014, Generation entered into an arrangement to purchase a 90%
equity interest and 90% of the tax attributes of a distributed energy company. Generation s total equity commitment in this arrangement was $91 million and is paid incrementally over an approximate two year period (see
Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for additional details). This arrangement did not meet the definition of a VIE and is recorded as an equity method investment.   
        In June 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, then a wholly owned subsidiary of
Generation, entered into an arrangement to purchase a 90% equity interest and 99% of the tax attributes of another distributed energy company. Separate from the equity investment, Generation provided $27 million in cash to the other
(10%) equity holder in the distributed energy company in exchange for a convertible

promissory note. In November 2015, Generation sold 69% of its equity interest in 2015 ESA Investco, LLC to a tax equity investor. Generation and the tax equity investor will contribute $250
million of equity incrementally through December 2016 in proportion to their ownership interests, which equates to approximately $172 million for the tax equity investor and $78 million for Generation (see Note 23 Commitments and
Contingencies for additional details). Generation and the tax equity investor provide a parental guarantee of up to $275 million in proportion to their ownership interests in support of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC s obligation to make equity
contributions to the distributed energy company. The investment in the distributed energy company was evaluated and it was determined to be a VIE for which Generation is not the primary beneficiary. Generation continues to consolidate 2015 ESA
Investco, LLC under the voting interest model.            Both
distributed energy companies from the 2014 and 2015 arrangements are considered related parties.             ComEd, PECO and BGE             The financing trust of ComEd, ComEd Financing III, the financing trusts of PECO, PECO Trust III and PECO Trust IV, and the financing trust of BGE, BGE Capital Trust II are not consolidated in Exelon s,
ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial statements. These financing trusts were created to issue mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. ComEd, PECO, and BGE have concluded that they do not have a significant variable interest
in ComEd Financing III, PECO Trust III, PECO Trust IV or BGE Capital Trust II as each Registrant financed its equity interest in the financing trusts through the issuance of subordinated debt and, therefore, has no equity at risk. See Note
14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.       
        3. Regulatory Matters (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The following matters below discuss the current status of material
regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.             Illinois
Regulatory Matters               Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act
(Exelon and ComEd).               Background    
        Since 2011, ComEd s electric distribution rates are established
through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA. EIMA also provides a structure for substantial capital investment by utilities to modernize Illinois  electric utility infrastructure. EIMA was scheduled to sunset, ending ComEd s
performance based rate formula and investment commitment, at December 31, 2017, unless approved to continue through 2022 by the Illinois General Assembly. On April 3, 2015, the Governor signed legislation extending the EIMA sunset from
2017 to 2019.            Participating utilities are required to file
an annual update to the performance-based formula rate tariff on or before May 1, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. This annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected
capital additions (initial revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation). See  Annual Electric
Distribution Filings  below for further details. Throughout each year, ComEd records regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and corresponding increases or decreases to   
         256

Operating revenue for any differences between the revenue requirement in effect and ComEd s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be approved by the ICC for that year s
reconciliation. As of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, ComEd had a regulatory asset associated with the electric distribution formula rate of $189 million and $371 million, respectively. The regulatory asset associated with
electric distribution true-up is amortized to Operating revenue in ComEd s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as the associated amounts are recovered through rates.   
        Participating utilities are also required to file an annual update on
their AMI implementation progress. On April 1, 2015, ComEd filed an annual progress report on its AMI Implementation Plan with the ICC, which allows for the installation of more than four million smart meters throughout ComEd s service
territory by 2018. To date, approximately two million smart meters have been installed in the Chicago area.         
  Pursuant to EIMA, ComEd annually contributes $4 million for customer education for as long as the AMI Deployment Plan remains in effect.
Additionally, ComEd contributes $10 million annually through 2016 to fund customer assistance programs for low-income customers, which will not be recoverable through rates.   
         Annual Electric Distribution Filings    
        For each of the following years, the ICC approved the following total
increases/(decreases) in ComEd s electric distributions formula rate filings:         

(a)  
  Includes a reduction of 5 basis points for a reliability performance metric penalty.     
         Formula Rate Structure Investigation    
        In October 2013, the ICC opened an investigation (the Investigation),
in response to a complaint filed by the Illinois Attorney General, to change the formula rate structure by requesting three changes: the elimination of the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate interest on the
annual reconciliation balance, the netting of associated accumulated deferred income   
         257   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
taxes against the annual reconciliation balance in calculating interest, and the use of average rather than year-end rate base for determining any ROE collar adjustment. On November 26,
2013, the ICC issued its final order in the Investigation, rejecting two of the proposed changes but accepting the proposed change to eliminate the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate interest on the annual
reconciliation balance. The accepted change became effective in January 2014, and reduced ComEd s 2014 revenue by approximately $8 million. This change had no financial statement impact on ComEd in 2013. ComEd and intervenors requested
rehearing, however all rehearing requests were denied by the ICC. ComEd and intervenors filed appeals with the Illinois Appellate Court. ComEd subsequently withdrew its appeal, but the Illinois Attorney General and the Citizens Utility Board
continued to argue that the ICC had wrongly approved ComEd s treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes (ADIT) relating to the annual reconciliation. On July 29, 2015, the Illinois Appellate Court rejected that appeal and affirmed the
ICC s decision and its acceptance of ComEd s treatment of ADIT. The period in which to file requests for further review has expired and that decision is final.   
         Appeal of Initial Formula Rate Tariff    
        On March 26, 2014, the Illinois Appellate Court issued an opinion
with respect to ComEd s appeal of the ICC s order relating to ComEd s initial formula rate tariff. The most significant financial issues under appeal related to ICC findings that were counter to the formula rate legislation and were
clarified by subsequent legislation (Senate Bill 9). Therefore, only a subset of the issues originally appealed remained. The Court found against ComEd on each of the remaining issues: compensation related adjustments, billing determinants and the
use of certain allocators. The Court s opinion has no accounting impact as ComEd recorded the distribution formula regulatory asset consistent with the ICC s final Order. On September 14, 2014, the Illinois Supreme Court declined to
hear that appeal. ComEd elected not to seek review by the United States Supreme Court on the Federal law issues. Accordingly, the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court is considered final.              Grand Prairie Gateway Transmission Line (ComEd).   On December 2, 2013, ComEd filed a request to obtain
the ICC s approval to construct a 60-mile overhead 345kV transmission line that traverses Ogle, DeKalb, Kane and DuPage Counties in Northern Illinois. On May 28, 2014, in a separate proceeding, FERC issued an order granting ComEd s
request to include 100% of the capital costs recorded to construction work in progress during construction of the line in ComEd s transmission rate base. If the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond ComEd s control, FERC
approved the ability for ComEd to recover 100% of its prudent costs incurred after May 21, 2014 and 50% of its costs incurred prior to May 21, 2014 in ComEd s transmission rate base. The costs incurred for the project prior to
May 21, 2014 were immaterial. ComEd has acquired numerous easements across the project route through voluntary transactions. ComEd will seek to acquire the property rights on the remaining 28 parcels through condemnation proceedings in the
circuit courts. ComEd began construction of the line during the second quarter of 2015 with an in-service date expected in the second quarter of 2017.       
          Illinois Procurement Proceedings (Exelon, Generation and
ComEd).   ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Since June 2009, the IPA designs, and the ICC approves, an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and the IPA administers a
competitive process under which ComEd procures its electricity supply from various suppliers, including Generation. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd has completed the ICC-approved procurement process for a portion of its energy requirements
through 2021.

   ComEd is required to purchase an increasing percentage of the electricity for customer deliveries
from renewable energy resources. Purchases by customers of electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers, whether as a result of the customers  own actions or as a result of municipal aggregation, are not included in this
calculation and have the effect of reducing ComEd s purchase obligation. ComEd entered into several 20-year contracts with unaffiliated suppliers in December 2010 regarding the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs in
order to meet its obligations under the Illinois  RPS. All associated costs are recoverable from customers.         
    FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc (Exelon and ComEd).   During 2013, the ICC approved, and directed ComEd and Ameren (the Utilities) to
enter into 20-year sourcing agreements with FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc (FutureGen), under which FutureGen will retrofit and repower an existing plant in Morgan County, Illinois to a 166 MW near zero emissions coal-fueled generation plant,
with an assumed commercial operation date in 2017. The sourcing agreement provides that ComEd and Ameren will pay FutureGen s contract prices, which are set annually pursuant to a formula rate. The contract prices are based on the difference
between the costs of the facility and the revenues FutureGen receives from selling capacity and energy from the unit into the MISO or other markets, as well as any other revenue FutureGen receives from the operation of the facility. The order also
directs ComEd and Ameren to recover these costs from their electric distribution customers through the use of a tariff, regardless of whether they purchase electricity from ComEd or Ameren, or from competitive electric generation suppliers.  
             In February 2013, ComEd filed an appeal with the
Illinois Appellate Court questioning the legality of requiring ComEd to procure power for retail customers purchasing electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. On July 22, 2014, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its ruling
re-affirming the ICC s order requiring ComEd to enter into the sourcing agreement with FutureGen and allowing the use of a tariff to recover its costs. ComEd decided not to appeal the Illinois Appellate Court s decision to the Illinois
Supreme Court. However, the competitive electric generation suppliers and several large consumers petitioned for leave to appeal the Illinois Appellate Court s decision. On November 26, 2014, the Illinois Supreme Court granted the
petition. ComEd executed the sourcing agreement with FutureGen in accordance with the ICC s order. In addition, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC seeking approval of the tariff allowing for the recovery of its costs associated with the
FutureGen contract from all of its electric distribution customers, which was approved by the ICC on September 30, 2014.         
  A significant portion of the cost of the development of FutureGen was being funded by the DOE under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009. In early February 2015, the DOE suspended funding for the project until further clarity could be obtained on certain significant hurdles facing the project, including the outcome of the litigation described above. Whether or not the DOE
funding will be reinstated at some later date is unknown at this time.            On January 13, 2016, FutureGen informed the Illinois Supreme Court that it had ceased all development efforts on the FutureGen project and would soon be seeking to terminate the FutureGen supply agreements.
Accordingly, FutureGen requested that the court dismiss the proceeding as moot. A decision from the Illinois Supreme Court dismissing the matter is expected in early 2016. In February 2016, FutureGen terminated its sourcing agreement with ComEd. As
a result, ComEd is under no further obligation under this agreement.              Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources (Exelon and ComEd).   Electric utilities in Illinois are required to include cost-effective energy efficiency resources in their plans to meet an  
    
         259

  incremental annual program energy savings requirement of 2% of energy delivered in the year commencing June 1, 2015 and each year thereafter. Additionally, during the ten-year period
that began June 1, 2008, electric utilities must implement cost-effective demand response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers. The energy efficiency and demand response goals are subject to
rate impact caps each year. Utilities are allowed recovery of costs for energy efficiency and demand response programs, subject to approval by the ICC. In January 2014, the ICC approved ComEd s third three-year Energy Efficiency and Demand
Response Plan covering the period June 2014 through May 2017. The plans are designed to meet Illinois  energy efficiency and demand response goals through May 2017, including reductions in delivered energy to all retail customers and in the
peak demand of eligible retail customers.              
  EIMA provides for additional energy efficiency in Illinois. Starting in the June 2013 through May 2014 period and occurring annually thereafter, as
part of the IPA procurement plan, ComEd is to include cost-effective expansion of current energy efficiency programs, and additional new cost-effective and/or third-party energy efficiency programs that are identified through a request for proposal
process. All cost-effective energy efficiency programs are included in the IPA procurement plan for consideration of implementation. While these programs are monitored separately from the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS), funds for both
the EEPS portfolio and IPA energy efficiency programs are collected under the same rider.            Illinois utilities are required to procure cost-effective renewable energy resources in amounts that equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers.
ComEd is also required to acquire amounts of renewable energy resources that will cumulatively increase this percentage to at least 10% by June 1, 2015, with an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate
impact criteria set forth by Illinois legislation. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply with the Illinois legislation. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon
transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without mark-up through rates.         
   Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters          
    2015 Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and PECO).   On March 27, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC
requesting an increase of $190 million to its annual service revenues for electric     delivery, which requested an ROE of 10.95%. On September 10, 2015, PECO and interested parties filed with the PAPUC a petition for joint settlement
for an increase of $127 million in annual distribution service revenue. No overall ROE was specified in the settlement. On December 17, 2015, the PAPUC approved the settlement of PECO s electric distribution rate case. The approved
electric delivery rates became effective on January 1, 2016.                 The settlement includes approval of the In-Program Arrearage Forgiveness ( IPAF ) Program, which provides for forgiveness of a portion of the eligible arrearage balance of its low-income Customer
Assistance Program (CAP) accounts receivable that will be determined as of program inception in October 2016. The forgiveness will be granted to the extent CAP customers remain current with payments. The Settlement guarantees PECO s recovery of
two-thirds of the arrearage balance through a combination of customer payments and rate recovery, including through future rates cases if necessary. The remaining one-third of the arrearage balance will be absorbed by PECO, of which a portion has
already been expensed as bad debt for CAP customer s accounts receivable balances.   
         260

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Although the actual arrearage balance is not defined until program inception, PECO believes that
it can reasonably estimate certain CAP customer accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2015 that will remain outstanding at program inception. Management determined its best estimate based on historical collectability information. As a
result, a regulatory asset of $7 million, representing the previously incurred bad debt expense associated with the estimated eligible accounts receivable balances, was recorded on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2015. This estimate will be revisited on a quarterly basis through program inception.         
    2010 Pennsylvania Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate Cases (Exelon and PECO).   On December 16, 2010, the PAPUC approved
the settlement of PECO s electric and natural gas distribution rate cases, which were filed in March 2010, providing increases in annual service revenue of $225 million and $20 million, respectively.        
        The settlements included a stipulation regarding how tax benefits
related to the application of any new IRS guidance on repairs deduction methodology are to be handled from a rate-making perspective. The settlements required that the expected cash benefit from the application of any new guidance to tax years prior
to 2011 be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011-43 providing a safe harbor method of tax accounting for electric transmission and distribution property. PECO adopted the safe
harbor and elected a method change for the 2010 tax year. The total refund to customers for the tax cash benefit from the application of the safe harbor to costs incurred prior to 2010 was $171 million. On October 4, 2011, PECO filed a
supplement to its electric distribution tariff to execute the refund to customers of the tax cash benefit related to the IRC Section 481(a)  catch-up  adjustment claimed on the 2010 income tax return, which is subject to adjustment
based on the outcome of IRS examinations. Credits have been reflected in customer bills since January 1, 2012.         
  In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. The
expected total refund to customers for the tax cash benefit from the application of the new method to costs incurred prior to 2011 is $54 million. This amount is subject to adjustment based on the outcome of IRS examinations. Credits have been
reflected in customer bills since January 1, 2013. PECO is awaiting IRS guidance that will provide a safe harbor method of accounting for gas transmission and distribution property.            The prospective tax benefits claimed as a result of the new methodology will be reflected in tax expense in the year in
which they are claimed on the tax return. As agreed to in the 2010 distribution rate case settlements, these benefits were reflected in the determination of revenue requirements in the 2015 electric distribution rate case discussed above and will be
reflected in the next natural gas distribution rate case. See Note 15 Income Taxes for additional information.         
  The 2010 electric and natural gas distribution rate case settlements did not specify the rate of return upon which the settlement rates are based,
but rather provided for an increase in annual revenue. PECO has not filed a transmission rate case since rates have been unbundled.         
    Pennsylvania Procurement Proceedings (Exelon and PECO).   Through PECO s first two PAPUC approved DSP Programs, PECO procured
electric supply for its default electric customers through PAPUC approved competitive procurements. DSP I and DSP II expired on May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2015, respectively.       
        The second DSP Program included a number of retail market enhancements
recommended by the PAPUC in its previously issued Retail Markets Intermediate Work Plan Order. PECO was also directed

to submit a plan to allow its low-income CAP customers to purchase their generation supply from EGSs beginning in April 2014. In May 2013, PECO filed its CAP Shopping Plan with the PAPUC. By an
Order entered on January 24, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s plan, with modifications, to make CAP shopping available beginning April 15, 2014. On March 20, 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA) and low-income advocacy
groups filed an appeal and emergency request for a stay with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, claiming that the PAPUC-ordered CAP Shopping plan does not contain sufficient protections for low-income customers. On July 14, 2015, the Court
issued opinions on the OCA and low-income advocacy group appeal. Specifically, the Court remanded the issue to the PAPUC with instructions that it approve a rule revision to the PECO CAP Shopping Plan that would prohibit CAP customers from entering
into contracts with an EGS that would impose early cancellation/termination fees. The PAPUC has appealed the Court s decision. PECO does not have information at this time as to what action it may be required to take following remand to the
PAPUC.            On December 4, 2014, the PAPUC approved
PECO s third DSP Program. The program has a 24-month term from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017, and complies with electric generation procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. Under the program, PECO is procuring electric supply
through four competitive procurements for fixed price full requirements contracts of two years or less for the residential classes and small and medium commercial classes and spot market price full requirement contracts for the large commercial and
industrial class load. Beginning in June 2016, the medium commercial class (101-500 kW) will move to spot market pricing. As of December 31, 2015, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, resulting from the
first two of its four scheduled procurements. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in purchased power from affiliates on PECO s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.            On March 12, 2015, PECO settled the CAP Design
with the Office of Consumer Advocates (OCA) and Low Income Advocates, and filed the proposed plan with the PAPUC on March 20, 2015. The program design changes the rate structure of PECO s CAP to make the bills more affordable to customers
enrolled in the assistance program. The CAP discounts continue to be recovered through PECO s universal service fund cost. On July 8, 2015, the CAP Design was approved by the PAPUC. PECO plans to implement the program changes in October
2016.              Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon
and PECO).   In April 2010, pursuant to Act 129 and the follow-on Implementation Order of 2009, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan (SMPIP), under which PECO will install more than 1.6 million
electric smart meters and an AMI communication network by 2020. PECO is currently in the second phase of the SMPIP and has deployed substantially all remaining smart meters as of December 31, 2015, for a total of 1.7 million smart meters.
In total, PECO currently expects to spend up to $589 million, excluding the cost of the original meters, on its smart meter infrastructure and approximately $155 million on smart grid investments through final deployment of which $200 million has
been funded by SGIG. As of December 31, 2015, PECO has spent $578 million and $155 million on smart meter and smart grid infrastructure, respectively, not including the DOE reimbursements received. Recovery of smart meter costs will be
reflected in base rates effective January 1, 2016.                   Energy Efficiency Programs (Exelon and PECO).   PECO s PAPUC-approved Phase I EE C Plan had a four-year term that began on June 1, 2009 and concluded on May 31, 2013. The Phase I plan
set forth how PECO     would meet the required reduction targets established by Act 129 s EE C provisions. On November 15, 2013, PECO filed its final compliance report with the PAPUC communicating PECO had met all Phase I
reduction targets.

   The PAPUC issued its Phase II EE C implementation order on August 2, 2012, that provided
energy consumption reduction requirements for the second phase of Act 129 s EE C program, which went into effect on June 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Phase II implementation order, PECO filed its three-year EE C Phase II Plan with the
PAPUC on November 1, 2012. The plan set forth how PECO would reduce electric consumption by at least 1,125,852 MWh in its service territory for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016, adjusted for weather and extraordinary
loads. The implementation order permitted PECO to apply any excess savings achieved during Phase I against its Phase II consumption reduction targets, with no reduction to its Phase II budget. In accordance with the Act 129 Phase II implementation
order, at least 10% and 4.5% of the total consumption reductions had to be through programs directed toward PECO s public and low income sectors, respectively. If PECO failed to achieve the required reductions in consumption, it would have been
subject to civil penalties of up to $20 million, which would not be recoverable from ratepayers. Act 129 mandates that the total cost of the plan may not exceed 2% of the electric company s total annual revenue as of December 31, 2006.
           On March 15, 2013 and February 28, 2014, PECO
filed Petitions for Approval to amend its EE C Phase II Plan to continue its DLC demand reduction program for mass market customers through May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2016, respectively. PECO proposed to fund the estimated $10 million
annual costs of the plan by modifying incentive levels for other Phase II programs. The costs of the DLC program will be recovered through PECO s Energy Efficiency Plan surcharge along with other Phase II Plan costs. The PAPUC granted
PECO s Petitions on May 5, 2013 and April 23, 2014, respectively.            The PAPUC issued its Phase III EE C implementation order on June 19, 2015, that provides energy consumption reduction requirements for the third phase of Act 129 s EE C program with a five-year
term from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. The order tentatively established PECO s five-year cumulative consumption reduction target at 2,080,553 MWh.   
        Pursuant to the Phase III implementation order, PECO filed its
five-year EE C Phase III Plan with the PAPUC on November 30, 2015. The Plan sets forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least 1,962,659 MWh, with a goal of 2,100,875 MWh in its service territory for the period June 1,
2016 through May 31, 2021. PECO expects a final decision from the PAPUC on PECO s EE C Phase III Plan during the first quarter of 2016.         
    Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (Exelon and PECO).   In November 2004, Pennsylvania adopted the AEPS Act. The AEPS Act mandated
that beginning in 2011, following the expiration of PECO s rate cap transition period, certain percentages of electric energy sold to Pennsylvania retail electric customers shall be generated from certain alternative energy resources as
measured in AECs. The requirement for electric energy that must come from Tier I alternative energy resources ranges from approximately 3.5% to 8%, and the requirement for Tier II alternative energy resources ranges from 6.2% to 10%. The required
compliance percentages incrementally increase each annual compliance period, which is from June 1 through May 31, until May 31, 2021. These Tier I and Tier II alternative energy resources include acceptable energy sources as set forth
in Act 129 and the AEPS Act.                PECO continues
to procure alternative energy credits through full requirements contracts and its existing long-term solar contracts to meet the annual AEPS compliance requirements. All AEPS compliance costs are being recovered on a full and current basis from
default service customers through the GSA.

     Pennsylvania Retail Electricity and Gas Markets (Exelon and PECO).   Beginning in
2011, the PAPUC issued an order outlining the next steps in its investigation into the status of competition in Pennsylvania s retail     electricity market. The PAPUC found that the existing default service model presents substantial
impediments to the development of a vibrant retail market in Pennsylvania and directed its Office of Competitive Markets Oversight to evaluate potential intermediate and long-term structural changes to the default service model. Through various
orders, the PAPUC issued default electric service pricing for customers in PECO s service territory. See Pennsylvania procurement proceedings discussed above for additional details.       
        In early 2014, the extreme weather in PECO s service territory
resulted in increased electricity commodity costs causing certain shopping customers to receive unexpectedly high utility bills. In response to a significant number of customer complaints throughout Pennsylvania, on April 3, 2014, the PAPUC
unanimously voted to adopt two rulemaking orders to address the issue. The first rulemaking order requires electric generation suppliers to provide more consumer education regarding their contract. The second rulemaking order requires electric
distribution companies to enable customers to switch suppliers within three business days (known as accelerated switching). The improved customer education and accelerated switching were to be in place within 30 days and six months of approval of
the orders, respectively. The orders became final on June 14, 2014. On December 4, 2014, the PAPUC approved PECO s implementation plan (known as Bill on Supplier Switch), allowing PECO to implement accelerated switching by the
December 15, 2014 deadline.            On September 12,
2013, the PAPUC issued an Order that initiated an investigation into Pennsylvania s natural gas retail market, including the role of the existing default service model and opportunities for market enhancements. On December 18, 2014, the
PAPUC issued a Final Order directing the Office of Competitive Market Oversight (OCMO) to continue its investigation, confirming that natural gas distribution companies should remain with the default service model for the time being and directing
establishment of a working group to examine other competitive issues. The OCMO has established a working group to review operation of the natural gas retail market and to consider potential recommendations on competitive issues.   
          Pennsylvania Act 11 of 2012 (Exelon and PECO).   In
February 2012, Act 11 was signed into law, which provided the PAPUC authority to approve the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge (DSIC) in rates designed to recover capital project costs incurred to repair, improve or replace
utilities  aging electric and natural gas distribution systems in Pennsylvania. Prior to recovering costs pursuant to a DSIC, the PAPUC s implementation order requires a utility to have a Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP)
approved by the Commission, which outlines how the utility is planning to increase its investment for repairing, improving or replacing aging infrastructure.         
  On May 7, 2015, the PAPUC approved PECO s modified natural gas LTIIP. In accordance with the approved LTIIP, PECO plans to spend $534
million through 2022 to further accelerate the replacement of existing gas mains and to relocate meters from indoors to outside in accordance with recent PAPUC rulemaking. In addition, on March 20, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC for
approval of its gas DSIC mechanism for recovery of gas LTIIP expenditures. On September 11, 2015, the PAPUC entered its Opinion and Order approving PECO s petition for a gas DSIC.            On March 27, 2015, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC for approval of its proposed electric DSIC and LTIIP. In
accordance with the LTIIP (System 2020 plan), PECO plans to spend $275 million over the next five years to modernize and storm-harden its electric distribution system, making it more

weather resistant and less vulnerable to damage. The DSIC will allow PECO the opportunity to recover the costs, subject to certain criteria, incurred to repair, improve or replace its electric
distribution property between rate cases. On October 22, 2015, the PAPUC entered its Opinion and Order approving PECO s proposed petition for its electric LTIIP and DSIC.   
         Maryland Regulatory Matters    
          2015 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon
and BGE).   On November 6, 2015, and as amended on January 5, 2016, BGE filed for electric and gas base rate increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting an increase of $121 million and $79 million, respectively, of which $103
million and $37 million,     respectively, is related to recovery of smart grid initiative costs. BGE requested a ROE for the electric and gas distribution rate case of 10.6% and 10.5%, respectively. The new electric and gas base rates are
expected to take effect in June 2016. BGE is also proposing to recover an annual increase of approximately $30 million for Baltimore City conduit lease fees through a surcharge. BGE cannot predict how much of the requested increase the MDPSC will
approve or if it will approve BGE s request for a conduit fee surcharge.                  2014 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).   On July 2, 2014, and as amended on September 15, 2014, BGE filed for electric and gas base increases with the MDPSC,
ultimately requesting increases of $99 million and $68 million, respectively.                On October 17, 2014, BGE filed with the MDPSC a unanimous settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) reached with all parties to the case under which it would receive an increase of $22 million in
electric base rates and an increase of $38 million in gas base rates. The Settlement Agreement establishes new depreciation rates which have the effect of decreasing annual depreciation expense by approximately $20 million, primarily for electric.
On December 4, 2014, the Public Utility Law Judge issued a proposed order approving the Settlement Agreement without modification, which became a final order on December 12, 2014. The approved distribution rate order authorizing BGE to
increase electric and gas distribution rates became effective for services rendered on or after December 15, 2014.         
    2013 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).   On May 17, 2013, and as amended on August 23, 2013,
BGE filed for electric and gas base increases with the MDPSC, ultimately requesting increases of $83 million and $24 million, respectively. In addition to these requested rate increases, BGE s application includes a request for recovery of
incremental capital expenditures and operating costs associated with BGE s proposed short-term reliability improvement plan (the  ERI initiative ) in response to a MDPSC order through a surcharge separate from base rates.  
             On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an
order in BGE s 2013 electric and natural gas distribution rate case for increases in annual distribution service revenue of $34 million and $12 million, respectively, and an allowed return on equity of 9.75% and 9.60%, respectively. Rates
became effective for services rendered on or after December 13, 2013. The MDPSC also authorized BGE to recover through a surcharge mechanism costs associated with five ERI initiative programs designed to accelerate electric reliability
improvements premised upon the condition that the MDPSC approve specific projects in advance of cost recovery. On March 31, 2014, after reviewing comments filed by the parties and conducting a hearing on the matter, the MDPSC approved all but
one project proposed for completion in 2014 as part of the ERI initiative. The ERI initiative surcharge became effective June 1, 2014. On November 2, 2015, BGE filed a surcharge update including a true-up of cost estimates included in the
2015 surcharge, along with its work plan and cost estimates for 2016, to be included in the 2016 surcharge. The MDPSC subsequently approved BGE s 2016 work plan and the 2016 surcharge.

   In January 2014, the residential consumer advocate in Maryland filed an appeal to the order issued
by the MDPSC on December 13, 2013 in BGE s 2013 electric and gas distribution rate cases. The residential consumer advocate filed its related legal memorandum on August 22, 2014, challenging the MDPSC s approval of the ERI
initiative surcharge. BGE submitted a response to the appeal on October 15, 2014, and a hearing was held on November 17, 2014. On October 26, 2015, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued an order affirming the MDPSC s
decision. However, on November 30, 2015, the residential consumer advocate filed an appeal of the Circuit Court s decision with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. BGE cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. If the residential
consumer advocate s appeal is successful, BGE could recover ERI expenditures through other regulatory mechanisms.         
    Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and BGE).   In August 2010, the MDPSC approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for
BGE that included the planned installation of 2 million residential and commercial electric and gas smart meters at an expected total cost of $480 million of which $200 million was funded by SGIG. The MDPSC s approval ordered BGE to defer
the associated incremental costs, depreciation and amortization, and an appropriate return, in a regulatory asset until such time as a cost-effective advanced     metering system is implemented. As of December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, BGE recorded a regulatory asset of $196 million and $128 million, respectively, representing incremental costs, depreciation and amortization, and a debt return on fixed assets related to its AMI program. As part of the
settlement in BGE s 2014 electric and gas distribution rate case, the cost of the retired non-AMI meters will be amortized over 10 years.              
  On February 26, 2014, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing BGE to impose a $75 upfront fee and an $11 recurring fee to customers electing to
opt-out of BGE s smart meter installation program, effective the later of the first full billing cycle following July 1, 2014, or the AMI installation date in a customer s community. The fees authorized by the order will be reviewed
after an initial 12 to 18 month period. On November 25, 2014, the MDPSC issued a decision approving BGE s proposal to automatically enroll unresponsive customers into the opt-out program and to charge those customers opt-out fees after BGE
has exhausted attempts to schedule a meter installation. On November 5, 2015, the MDPSC held a hearing to evaluate the $11 recurring monthly fee paid by opt-out customers. Effective with January 2016 bills, the monthly recurring fee was reduced
to $5.50.            As part of the 2015 electric and gas distribution
rate case filed on November 6, 2015, BGE is seeking recovery of its smart grid initiative costs. Of BGE s requested $200 million, $140 million relates to the smart grid initiative. In support of its recovery of smart grid initiative costs,
BGE provided evidence demonstrating that the benefits exceed the costs by a ratio of 2.3 to 1.0, on a nominal basis.         
    New Electric Generation (Exelon and BGE).   On April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order directing BGE and two other Maryland
utilities to enter into a contract for differences (CfD) with CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), under which CPV will construct an approximately 700MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation plant in Waldorf, Maryland, that CPV projected will be in
commercial operation by June 1, 2015. CPV subsequently sought to extend that date. The initial term of the proposed contract is 20 years. The CfD mandates that BGE and the other utilities pay (or receive) the difference between CPV s
contract prices and the revenues CPV receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the PJM capacity market. The MDPSC s order requires the three Maryland utilities to enter into a CfD in amounts proportionate to their relative SOS
load. On April 16, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order that required BGE to execute a specific form of contract with CPV, and the parties executed the contract as of June 6, 2013.        
        On April 27, 2012, a civil complaint was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland by certain unaffiliated parties that challenged the actions taken by the MDPSC on Federal law grounds. On

October 24, 2013, the U.S. District Court issued a judgment order finding that the MDPSC s Order directing BGE and the two other Maryland utilities to enter into a CfD, which assures
that CPV receives a guaranteed fixed price regardless of the price set by the federally regulated wholesale market, violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. On November 22, 2013, the MDPSC and CPV appealed the District
Court s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling in an opinion issued June 2, 2014. The MDPSC and CPV filed petitions for certiorari, seeking review of the
case by the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition to review the Fourth Circuit decision, and that appeal is now pending in the Supreme Court with oral argument scheduled for February 24, 2016.
           On February 9, 2011, a civil complaint was filed by
Exelon and other unaffiliated parties in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, challenging a 2011 New Jersey law, the Long Term Capacity Pilot Program Act (LCAPP). LCAPP provides eligible generators with 15-year fixed
contracts for the sale of capacity in the PJM capacity market. On October 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court issued a judgment order finding that LCAPP violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. CPV and New Jersey appealed
the District Court s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September 11, 2014, the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court s ruling finding LCAPP unconstitutional. On November 26, 2014, CPV and
New Jersey sought Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit decision. On October 29, 2015, the Supreme Court stayed the petition to review the Third Circuit case pending their review of the Fourth Circuit Maryland case described above.
           On May 4, 2012, BGE filed a petition in the Circuit
Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland, seeking judicial review of the MDPSC order under state law. That petition was subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and consolidated with similar appeals that have been filed by
other interested parties. On October 1, 2013, the Circuit Court Judge issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order finding the decisions of the MDPSC were within its statutory authority under Maryland law. This decision is separate from the judgment
in the federal litigation that the MDPSC Order is unconstitutional and the CfD is unenforceable under federal law. The federal judgment, if upheld, would prevent enforcement of the CfD even if the Circuit Court decision stands. On October 29,
2013, BGE and the two other Maryland utilities appealed the Circuit Court s ruling to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. That appeal has been stayed pending decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the federal action described above.
           Depending on the ultimate outcome of the pending state and
federal litigation, on the eventual market conditions, and on the manner of cost recovery as of the effective date of the agreement, the CfD could have a material impact on Exelon and BGE s results of operations, cash flows and financial
positions.            Exelon believes that this and other states 
projects may have artificially suppressed capacity prices in PJM and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of Exelon s market driven position. In addition to this litigation, Exelon is working with other market participants
to implement market rules that will appropriately limit the market suppressing effect of such state activities.         
    MDPSC Derecho Storm Order (Exelon and BGE).   Following the June 2012 Derecho storm which hit the mid-Atlantic region interrupting
electrical service to a significant portion of the State of Maryland, the MDPSC issued an order on February 27, 2013 requiring BGE and other Maryland utilities to file several comprehensive reports with short-term and long-term plans to improve
reliability and grid resiliency that were due at various times before August 30, 2013.       
         267

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   On September 3, 2013, BGE filed a comprehensive long term assessment examining potential
alternatives for improving the resiliency of the electric grid and a staffing analysis reviewing historical staffing levels as well as forecasting staffing levels necessary under various storm scenarios. During the summer of 2014, an evaluation of
the reports filed by BGE and other Maryland utilities was undertaken by consultants on behalf of the MDPSC and MDPSC Staff. The MDPSC Staff also proposed standards for reliability during major events and estimated times of restoration as well as
undertaking an evaluation of performance-based ratemaking principles and methodologies that would more directly and transparently align reliable service with the utilities  distribution rates and that reduce returns or otherwise penalize
sub-standard performance. The MDPSC held hearings in September 2014. BGE currently cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, which may result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs.   
          The Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement
Program (Exelon and BGE).   In 2013, legislation intended to accelerate gas infrastructure replacements in Maryland was signed into law. The law established a mechanism, separate from base rate proceedings, for gas companies to promptly
recover reasonable and prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects incurred after June 1, 2013. The monthly surcharge and infrastructure replacement costs must be approved by the MDPSC and are subject to a cap and require an
annual true-up of the surcharge revenues against actual expenditures. Investment levels in excess of the cap would be recoverable in a subsequent gas base rate proceeding at which time all costs for the infrastructure replacement projects would be
rolled into gas distribution rates. Irrespective of the cap, BGE is required to file a gas rate case every five years under this legislation.             
  On August 2, 2013, BGE filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. On January 29, 2014, the MDPSC issued a
decision conditionally approving the first five years of BGE s plan and surcharge. On November 16, 2015, BGE filed a surcharge update to be effective January 1, 2016, including a true-up of cost estimates included in the 2015
surcharge, along with its 2016 project list and projected capital estimates of $113 million to be included in the 2016 surcharge calculation. The MDPSC subsequently approved BGE s 2016 project list and the proposed surcharge for 2016, which
included the 2015 surcharge true-up. As of December 31, 2015, BGE recorded a regulatory asset of less than $1 million, representing the difference between the surcharge revenues and program costs.   
        In 2014, the residential consumer advocate in Maryland appealed
MDPSC s decision on BGE s infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge with the Baltimore City Circuit Court, who affirmed the MDPSC s decision. On October 10, 2014, the residential consumer advocate noticed its
appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals from the judgment entered by the Baltimore City Circuit Court. During the third quarter of 2015, the residential consumer advocate, MDPSC and BGE filed briefs. Oral argument in this matter was held
before the Court of Special Appeals on November 3, 2015. On January 28, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals issued a decision affirming the MDPSC s decision.   
         New York Regulatory Matters    
          Ginna Nuclear Power Plant Reliability Support Services Agreement
(Exelon and Generation).   Ginna Nuclear Power Plant s (Ginna) prior period fixed-price PPA contract with Rochester Gas   Electric Company (RG E) expired in June 2014. In light of the expiration of the PPA and prevailing
market conditions, in January 2014, Ginna advised the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) and the ISO-NY that, in the absence of a reliability need, Ginna management       
         268

  would make a recommendation, subject to approval by the CENG board, that the Ginna plant be retired as soon as practicable. A formal study conducted by the ISO-NY and RG E dated as of
May 12, 2014 concluded that Ginna needs to remain in operation to maintain the reliability of the transmission grid in the Rochester region through September 2018 when planned transmission system upgrades undertaken by RG E are expected to
be completed.                In November 2014, in response
to a petition filed by Ginna, the NYPSC directed Ginna and RG E to negotiate a Reliability Support Services Agreement (RSSA). In February 2015, regulatory filings, including RSSA terms negotiated between Ginna and RG E, to support the
continued operation of Ginna for reliability purposes were made with the NYPSC and with the FERC for their approval. Although the RSSA contract is still subject to such regulatory approvals, on April 1, 2015, Ginna began delivering the power
and capacity from the Ginna plant into the ISO-NY consistent with the technical provisions of the proposed RSSA contract.         
  In April 2015, the FERC issued an order which directed Ginna to make a compliance filing to ensure that the RSSA does not allow Ginna to receive
revenues above its full cost of service and which rejected any extension of the RSSA beyond its initial term; rather the order required that any extension be subject to the rules currently being developed by the ISO-NY. The FERC order also set the
RSSA for hearing and settlement procedures. In response to the FERC s April 2015 order, in May 2015, Ginna submitted a compliance filing to the FERC containing proposed revisions to the RSSA addressing the FERC s requirements and
maintaining the April 1, 2015 proposed effective date. In July 2015, the FERC accepted Ginna s compliance filing effective April 1, 2015. The FERC accepted Ginna s proposal for market revenue sharing subject to a cap effective
April 1, 2015, and rejected requests for rehearing by intervenors on a number of matters related to jurisdiction, the reliability need, the RSSA term, and possible price suppression.            In August 2015, Ginna reached a settlement in principle with intervenors modifying certain terms and conditions in the
originally negotiated agreement. The proposed RSSA under the settlement preserves the value of the contract originally negotiated with RG E, but shortens the term from 3.5 to 2 years, expiring March 31, 2017 and required RG E to
complete a new transmission reliability study to determine whether an interim reliability solution is required beyond March 31, 2017. That reliability study was completed in October 2015, and it identified certain RG E projects that are
needed to solve reliability problems that would be caused by an early retirement of Ginna. Under the settlement agreement, Ginna was required by December 29, 2015 to submit a bid to provide reliability services beginning April 1, 2017
until the necessary RG E transmission upgrades are in service, which RG E expects will be no later than October 31, 2017. Ginna submitted such a bid in December 2015. RG E has the right until June 30, 2016 to select Ginna as an
ongoing reliability solution. If such a need exists, and if Ginna is selected, Ginna and RG E could enter into an additional RSSA commencing April 1, 2017 on the rates, terms and conditions set forth in Ginna s bid, or as might be
otherwise agreed by Ginna and RG E.            If RG E seeks a
reliability solution with Ginna, but RG E and Ginna do not reach an agreement on rates, terms, and conditions of a new RSSA by March 31, 2016 (or by June 30, 2016 if RG E elects to defer the decision date), the settlement agreement
requires Ginna to file an unexecuted additional RSSA with the FERC for adjudication. If Ginna is not selected for continued reliability service and does not plan to retire shortly after the expiration of the RSSA, Ginna is required to file a notice
to that effect with the NYPSC no later than September 30, 2016. Under the terms of the proposed RSSA, if RG E does not select Ginna to provide reliability service after March 31, 2017, and Ginna continues to operate after June 14,
2017, Ginna would be required to make certain refund payments related to capital expenditures to RG E.

   The August 2015 settlement was filed at the NYPSC and at the FERC in October 2015 and remains
subject to review and approval by both agencies; such reviews are not expected to be completed until the first quarter of 2016.         
  Until final regulatory approvals are received, Generation is recognizing revenue based on market prices for energy and capacity delivered by Ginna
into the ISO-NY. Upon receiving regulatory approvals, under the RSSA contract terms, Generation would then recognize revenue based on the final approved pricing contained in the contract retroactively from the April 1, 2015 effective date.
While the RSSA is expected to receive regulatory approvals and, therefore, permit Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term, there is still a risk that, for economic reasons, including the possibility that the FERC or the NYPSC may condition
the approval of the RSSA on a modification of the rates set forth in the RSSA, Ginna could be retired before 2029, which is the end of its operating license period. In the event the plant were to be retired before the current license term ends in
2029, Exelon s and Generation s results of operations could be adversely affected by accelerated future decommissioning costs, severance costs, increased depreciation rates, and impairment charges, among other items. However, it is not
expected that such impacts would be material to Exelon s or Generation s results of operations.             Federal Regulatory Matters               Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd and BGE).   ComEd s and BGE s transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd and BGE are required to file an annual
update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year. The annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions. The
update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. ComEd and BGE record regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and corresponding
increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement in effect and ComEd s and BGE s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be filed with the FERC for that year s
reconciliation. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, ComEd had a regulatory asset associated with the transmission formula rate of $31 million and $21 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, BGE had a net regulatory asset
associated with the transmission formula rate of $12 million and $1 million, respectively. The regulatory asset associated with transmission true-up is amortized to Operating revenues within their Consolidated Statements of Operations of
Comprehensive Income as the associated amounts are recovered through rates.

   For each of the following years, the following total increases/(decreases) were included in
ComEd s and BGE s electric transmission formula rate filings:         

(a)  
  For BGE, this excludes the increase in revenue requirement associated with dedicated facilities charges. The increases for dedicated facilities were $13 million and $3 million
for 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no dedicated facilities charges in 2013 for BGE.     

(b)  
  Refers to the weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate bases for ComEd and BGE. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd s 2007 transmission rate
case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50% and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55%. As part of the FERC-approved
settlement of BGE s 2005 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.30%, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for participating in PJM.     

(c)  
  The time period for any challenges to the annual transmission formula rate update filings expired with no challenges submitted.     
          FERC Transmission Complaint (Exelon and BGE).   On
February 27, 2013, consumer advocates and regulators from the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, and the Delaware Electric Municipal Cooperatives (the parties), filed a complaint at FERC against BGE and the PHI companies
relating to their respective transmission formula rates. BGE s formula rate includes a 10.8% base rate of return on common equity (ROE) and a 50 basis point incentive for participating in PJM (and certain additional incentive basis points on
certain projects). The parties sought a reduction in the base return on equity to 8.7% and changes to the formula rate process. Under FERC rules, any revenues subject to refund are limited to a fifteen month period and the earliest date from which
the base ROE could be adjusted and refunds required is the date of the complaint.                On August 21, 2014, FERC issued an order in the BGE and PHI companies  proceeding, which established hearing and settlement judge procedures for the complaint, and set a refund effective date of
February 27, 2013.            On December 8, 2014, various
state agencies in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and D.C. filed a second complaint against BGE regarding the base ROE of the transmission business seeking a reduction from 10.8% to 8.8%. The filing of the second complaint created a second refund
window. By order issued on February 9, 2015, FERC established a hearing on the second complaint with the complainants  requested refund effective date of December 8, 2014. On February 20, 2015, the Chief Judge issued an order
consolidating the two complaint proceedings and established an Initial Decision issuance deadline of February 29, 2016.         
  On November 6, 2015, BGE and the PHI companies and the complainants filed a settlement with FERC covering the issues raised in the complaints.
The settlement provides for a 10% base ROE, effective March 8, 2016, which will be augmented by the PJM incentive adder of 50 basis points, and refunds to BGE customers of $13.7 million. The settlement also provides a moratorium on any change
in the ROE until June 1, 2018. On December 16, 2015, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge submitted a Certification of the Uncontested Settlement to the FERC Commissioners. The settlement remains subject to FERC approval.

     PJM Transmission Rate Design and Operating Agreements (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE).  
PJM Transmission Rate Design specifies the rates for transmission service charged to customers within PJM.     Currently, ComEd, PECO and BGE incur costs based on the existing rate design, which charges customers based on the cost of the
existing transmission facilities within their load zone and the cost of new transmission facilities based on those who benefit from those facilities. In April 2007, FERC issued an order concluding that PJM s current rate design for existing
facilities is just and reasonable and should not be changed. In the same order, FERC held that the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above should be socialized across the entire PJM footprint and that the costs of new facilities less than 500 kV
should be allocated to the customers of the new facilities who caused the need for those facilities. A number of parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for review of the decision.        
        In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC s
order with regard to the existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue of the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above (Cost Allocation Issue) for further consideration by the FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its
earlier decision to socialize the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above. A number of parties filed appeals of these orders. In June 2014, the court again remanded the Cost Allocation Issue to FERC. On December 18, 2014, FERC issued an order
setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the Cost Allocation Issue. The hearing only concerns new facilities approved by the PJM Board prior to February 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, settlement discussions are
continuing.            Because a new cost allocation had been adopted
for projects approved by the PJM Board on or after February 1, 2013, this latest remand only involves the cost allocation for facilities 500 kV and above approved prior to that date. ComEd anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes
effective after December 31, 2006, should be recoverable through retail rates and, thus, the rate design changes are not expected to have a material impact on ComEd s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. PECO
anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes should be recoverable through the transmission service charge rider approved in PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement and, thus, the rate design changes are not expected
to have a material impact on PECO s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. To the extent any rate design changes are retroactive to periods prior to January 1, 2011, there may be an impact on PECO s results of
operations. BGE anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes effective after the implementation of its standard offer service programs in Maryland should be recoverable through retail rates and, thus, the rate design changes are not
expected to have a material impact on BGE s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.         
  ComEd, PECO and BGE are committed to the construction of transmission facilities under their operating agreements with PJM to maintain system
reliability. ComEd, PECO and BGE will work with PJM to continue to evaluate the scope and timing of any required construction projects. ComEd, PECO and BGE s estimated commitments are as follows:   
     
            Demand Response Resource Order
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE).   On May 23, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion vacating the FERC Order No. 745 (D.C. Circuit Decision). Order No. 745 established uniform compensation levels for demand
response resources       
         272

that participate in the day ahead and real-time wholesale energy markets. Under Order No. 745, buyers in ISO and RTO markets were required to pay demand response resources the full
Locational Marginal Price when the demand response replaced a generation resource and was cost-effective. On January 25, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court decision and remanded the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court.
While we cannot predict exactly how the D.C. Circuit Court will handle the matter on remand, we do not expect there will be any significant change in how demand response resources have or will participate in and be paid by wholesale energy markets.
Thus, we do not     anticipate that there will be any impact to the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows based on these proceedings.       
          New England Capacity Market Results (Exelon and
Generation).   Each year, ISO New England, Inc. (ISO-NE) files the results of its annual capacity auction at the FERC which is required to include documentation regarding the competitiveness of the auction. Consistent with this requirement, on
February 27, 2015, ISO-NE filed the results of its ninth capacity auction (covering the June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019 delivery period). On June 18, 2015, the FERC accepted the results of the ninth capacity auction. On
July 20, 2015, a union representing utility workers sought rehearing of that decision which the FERC denied on December 30, 2015. It is not clear whether the FERC s order will be appealed.       
        On February 28, 2014, ISO-NE filed the results of its eighth
capacity auction (covering the June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018 delivery period). On June 27, 2014, the FERC issued a letter to ISO-NE noting that ISO-NE s February 28, 2014 filing was deficient and that ISO-NE must file
additional information before the FERC can process the filing. ISO-NE filed the information on July 17, 2014, and the ISO-NE s filings became effective by operation of law pursuant to a notice issued by the secretary of FERC on
September 16, 2014. Several parties sought rehearing of the secretary s notice which was effectively denied in October 2014 and have since appealed the matter to the D.C. Circuit Court. On April 7, 2015 the D.C. Circuit Court issued
an order referring the matter to a merits panel where issues raised by parties challenging the FERC decision will be heard as well as FERC s Motion to Dismiss the challenges. It is not clear whether the court will decide ultimately on the
merits of the case or whether it will dismiss the case as FERC urges based on the fact that there is no action by the FERC to be considered. Nonetheless, while any change in the auction results is thought to be unlikely, Exelon and Generation cannot
predict with certainty what further action the court may take concerning the results of that auction, but any court action could be material to Exelon s and Generation s expected revenues from the capacity auction.   
          License Renewals (Exelon and Generation).   Generation has
40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review.  
             On May 29, 2013, Generation submitted
applications to the NRC to extend the current operating licenses of Byron Units 1 and 2 and Braidwood Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. On November 19, 2015, the NRC approved Generation s request to extend the operating licenses of Byron Unit 1
and 2 by 20 years to 2044 and 2046, respectively. On January 27, 2016 the NRC approved Generation s request to extend the operating licenses of Braidwood Unit 1 and 2 by 20 years to 2046 and 2047, respectively.   
        On December 09, 2014, Generation submitted an application to the
NRC to extend the current operating licenses of LaSalle Units 1 and 2, which were set to expire in 2022 and 2023, respectively.         
  On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to FERC for 46-year licenses for the
Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy   
         273

Run Pumped Storage Project (Muddy Run), respectively. On December 22, 2015, FERC issued a new 40-year license for Muddy Run. The license term expires on December 1, 2055. The financial
impact associated with Muddy Run license commitments is estimated to be in the range of an incremental $25 million to $35 million, and includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses, primarily relating to fish passage and habitat
improvement projects. At December 31, 2015, $22 million of direct costs associated with the licensing effort have been capitalized.         
  Generation is working with stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues with the MDE for Conowingo, including: (1) water quality,
(2) fish passage and habitat, and (3) sediment. On January 30, 2014, Generation filed a water quality certification application pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA with MDE for Conowingo, addressing these and other issues,
although Generation cannot currently predict the conditions that ultimately may be imposed. MDE indicated that it believed it did not have sufficient information to process Generation s application. As a result, Generation entered into an
agreement with MDE to work with state agencies in Maryland, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Chesapeake Bay Program
to design, conduct and fund an additional multi-year sediment study. Generation has agreed to contribute up to $3.5 million to fund the additional study. Because states must act on applications under Section 401 of the CWA within one year and
the sediment study would not be completed prior to January 31, 2015, Exelon withdrew its application for a water quality certification on December 4, 2014. FERC policy requires that an applicant resubmit its request for a water quality
certification within 90 days of the date of withdrawal. Accordingly, on March 3, 2015, Generation refiled its application for a water quality certification. Exelon has agreed with MDE to withdraw and refile its application for a water quality
certification as necessary pending completion of the sediment study. On August 7, 2015, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) submitted its modified fishway prescription to FERC in the Conowingo licensing proceedings. On September 11, 2015,
Exelon filed a request for an administrative hearing and proposed an alternative prescription to challenge USFWS s preliminary prescription. Resolution of these issues relating to Conowingo may have a material effect on Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations and financial position through an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs.         
  The FERC license for Conowingo expired on September 1, 2014. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC is required to issue an annual license for a
facility until the new license is issued. On September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. If FERC does not issue a new license prior to the expiration of an annual
license, the annual license will renew automatically. On March 11, 2015, FERC issued the final Environmental Impact Statement for Conowingo. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which includes the
license renewal period. As of December 31, 2015, $23 million of direct costs associated with licensing efforts have been capitalized.         
   Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain
types of regulation. Under this guidance, regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of
costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.

Pension and other postretirement
benefits.   As of December 31, 2015, Exelon had regulatory assets of $3,156 million and regulatory liabilities of $94 million related to ComEd s and BGE s portion of deferred costs associated with Exelon s pension plans and
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s portion of   
         276

deferred costs associated with Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans. PECO s pension regulatory recovery is based on cash contributions and is not included in the regulatory asset
(liability) balances. The regulatory asset (liability) is amortized in proportion to the recognition of prior service costs (gains), transition obligations and actuarial losses (gains) attributable to Exelon s pension and other postretirement
benefit plans determined by the cost recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits. ComEd, PECO and BGE will recover these costs through base rates as allowed in their most recently approved regulated
rate orders. The pension and other postretirement benefit regulatory asset balance includes a regulatory asset established at the date of the Constellation merger related to BGE s portion of the deferred costs associated with legacy
Constellation s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The BGE-related regulatory asset is being amortized over a period of approximately 12 years, which generally represents the expected average remaining service period of plan
participants at the date of the Constellation merger. See Note 17 Retirement Benefits for additional detail. No return is earned on Exelon s regulatory asset.   
          Deferred income taxes.   These costs represent the
difference between the method by which the regulator allows for the recovery of income taxes and how income taxes would be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets and liabilities associated with deferred income taxes, recorded in compliance with the
authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation and income taxes, include the deferred tax effects associated principally with accelerated depreciation accounted for in accordance with the ratemaking policies of the ICC, PAPUC
and MDPSC, as well as the revenue impacts thereon, and assume continued recovery of these costs in future transmission and distribution rates. For BGE, this amount includes the impacts of a reduction in the deductibility, for Federal income tax
purposes, of certain retiree health care costs pursuant to the March 2010 Health Care Reform Acts. For BGE, these additional income taxes are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s March
2011 rate order. For PECO, this amount includes the impacts of electric and gas distribution repairs in the deductibility pursuant to PUC s 2010 and 2015 rate case settlement agreements. See Note 15 Income Taxes and Note 17 Retirement
Benefits for additional information. ComEd, PECO and BGE are not earning a return on the regulatory asset in base rates.         
    AMI programs.   For ComEd, this amount represents meter costs associated with ComEd s AMI pilot program approved in ComEd s
2010 rate case. The recovery periods for the meter costs are through January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, ComEd had regulatory assets of $137 million and $88 million, respectively, related to accelerated
depreciation costs resulting from the early retirements of non-AMI meters, which will be amortized over an average ten year period pursuant to the ICC approved AMI Deployment plan. ComEd is earning a return on the regulatory asset. For PECO, this
amount represents accelerated depreciation and filing and implementation costs relating to the PAPUC-approved Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan as well as the return on the un-depreciated investment, taxes, and operating and maintenance
expenses. The approved plan allows for recovery of filing and implementation costs incurred through December 31, 2012. In addition, the approved plan provides for recovery of program costs, which includes depreciation on new equipment placed in
service, beginning in January 2011 on full and current basis, which includes interest income or expense on the under or over recovery. The approved plan also provides for recovery of accelerated depreciation on PECO s non-AMI meter assets over
a 10-year period ending December 31, 2020. Recovery of smart meter costs will be reflected in base rates effective January 1, 2016. For BGE, this amount represents smart grid pilot program costs as well as the incremental costs associated
with implementing full deployment of a smart grid program. Pursuant to a MDPSC order, pilot program costs of $11 million were deferred in a regulatory asset, and, beginning with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order, is earning BGE s most
current authorized rate of return. In August   
         277

2010, the MDPSC approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE, authorizing BGE to establish a separate regulatory asset for incremental costs incurred to implement the initiative,
including the net depreciation and amortization costs associated with the meters, and an appropriate rate of return on these costs, a portion of which is not recognized under GAAP until cost recovery begins. Additionally, the MDPSC requires that BGE
prove the cost-effectiveness of the entire smart grid initiative prior to seeking recovery of the costs deferred in these regulatory assets. As part of the 2015 electric and gas distribution rate case filed on November 6, 2015 and amended on
January 5, 2016, BGE is seeking recovery of its smart grid initiative costs. Of BGE s requested $200 million, $140 million relates to the smart grid initiative. In support of its recovery of smart grid initiative costs, BGE provided
evidence demonstrating that the benefits exceed the costs by a ratio of 2.3 to 1.0, on a nominal basis. If approved by the MDPSC, the amortization of these deferred costs would begin in June 2016. BGE s AMI regulatory asset excludes costs for
non-AMI meters being replaced by AMI meters, as recovery of those costs commenced with the new rates approved and implemented with the MDPSC order in BGE s 2014 electric and gas distribution case.   
          Under-recovered distribution services costs.   These
amounts represent under (over) recoveries related to electric distribution services costs recoverable (refundable) through EIMA s performance based formula rate tariff. Under (over) recoveries for the annual reconciliations are recoverable
(refundable) over a one-year period and costs for certain one-time events, such as large storms, are recoverable over a five-year period. ComEd earns and pays a return on under and over recovered costs, respectively. As of December 31, 2015,
the regulatory asset was comprised of $142 million for the 2014 and 2015 annual reconciliations and $47 million related to significant one-time events, including $36 million in deferred storm costs and $11 million of Constellation merger and
integration related costs. As of December 31, 2014, the regulatory asset was comprised of $286 million for the 2013 and 2014 annual reconciliations and $85 million related to significant one-time events, including $66 million in deferred storm
costs and $19 million of Constellation merger and integration related costs. See  Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act  above for further details.         
    Debt costs.   Consistent with rate recovery for ratemaking purposes, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s recoverable losses on
reacquired long-term debt related to regulated operations are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the new debt issued to finance the debt redemption or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not
refinanced. Interest-rate swap settlements are deferred and amortized over the period that the related debt is outstanding or the life of the original issuance retired. These debt costs are used in the determination of the weighted cost of capital
applied to rate base in the rate-making process. ComEd and BGE are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs, while PECO is earning a return on the premium of the cost of the reacquired debt through base rates.   
          Fair value of BGE long-term debt.   These amounts represent
the regulatory asset recorded at Exelon for the difference in the fair value of the long-term debt of BGE as of the Constellation merger date based on the MDPSC practice to allow BGE to recover its debt costs through rates. Exelon is amortizing the
regulatory asset and the associated fair value over the life of the underlying debt and is not earning a return on the recovery of these costs.         
    Severance.   For BGE, these costs represent deferred severance costs associated with a 2010 workforce reduction that were deferred as a
regulatory asset and are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order. Additionally, costs associated with the 2012 BGE voluntary workforce reduction were deferred in 2012 as
a regulatory asset in accordance with the MDPSC s orders in prior rate cases and are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in July 2012. BGE is earning a regulated return on the regulatory asset included in base rates.   
         278

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Asset retirement obligations.   These costs represent future legally required removal
costs associated with existing asset retirement obligations. PECO will begin to earn a return on, and a recovery of, these costs once the removal activities have been performed. ComEd and BGE will recover these costs through future depreciation
rates and will earn a return on these costs once the removal activities have been performed. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.   
          MGP remediation costs  . ComEd is allowed recovery of these
costs under ICC approved rates. For PECO, these costs are recoverable through rates as affirmed in the 2010 approved natural gas distribution rate case settlement. The period of recovery for both ComEd and PECO will depend on the timing of the
actual expenditures. ComEd and PECO are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in
distribution rates. For BGE, $5 million of clean-up costs incurred during the period from July 2000 through November 2005 and an additional $1 million from December 2005 through November 2010 are recoverable through rates in accordance with MDPSC
orders. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset and these costs are being amortized over 10-year periods that began in January 2006 and December 2010,     respectively. The recovery period for the 10-year period that began January
2006 was extended for an additional 24 months, in accordance with the MDPSC approved 2014 electric and natural gas distribution rate case order. See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.       
          Under recovered uncollectible accounts.   These amounts
represent the difference between ComEd s annual uncollectible accounts expense and revenues collected in rates through an ICC-approved rider. The difference between net uncollectible account charge-offs and revenues collected through the rider
each calendar year is recovered or refunded over a twelve-month period beginning in June of the following calendar year. ComEd does not earn a return on these under recoveries.   
          Renewable energy.   In December 2010, ComEd entered into
several 20-year floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. Since the swap contracts were deemed prudent by the Illinois
Settlement Legislation, ensuring ComEd of full recovery in rates, the changes in fair value each period as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability are recorded by ComEd. ComEd does not earn (pay) a return on the regulatory asset
(liability). The basis for the mark-to-market derivative asset or liability position is based on the difference between ComEd s cost to purchase energy at the market price and the contracted price.   
          Energy and transmission programs.   These amounts represent
under (over) recoveries related to energy and transmission costs recoverable (refundable) under ComEd s ICC and/or FERC-approved rates. Under (over) recoveries are recoverable (refundable) over a one-year period or less. ComEd earns a return or
interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s regulatory asset of $43 million included $5 million related to under-recovered energy costs, $31 million associated
with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC-approved formula rate tariff, and $7 million of Constellation merger and integration costs to be recovered upon FERC approval. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s regulatory liability of
$53 million included $29 million related to over-recovered energy costs and $24 million associated with revenues received for renewable energy requirements. As of December 31, 2014, ComEd s regulatory asset of $33 million included $4
million related to under-recovered energy costs, $22 million associated with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC-approved formula rate tariff, and $7 million of   
         279

Constellation merger and integration costs to be recovered upon FERC approval. As of December 31, 2014, ComEd s regulatory liability of $19 million included $3 million related to
over-recovered energy costs and $16 million associated with revenues received for renewable energy requirements. See  Transmission Formula Rate  above for further details.   
        The PECO energy costs represent the electric and gas supply related
costs recoverable (refundable) under PECO s GSA and PGC, respectively. PECO earns interest on the under-recovered energy and natural gas costs and pays interest on over-recovered energy and natural gas costs to customers. In addition, the DSP
Program costs are presented on a net basis with PECO s GSA under (over)-recovered energy costs. See additional discussion below. The PECO transmission costs represent the electric transmission costs recoverable (refundable) under the TSC under
which PECO earns interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2015, PECO had a regulatory liability that included $35 million related to the DSP program, $22 million related to
over-recovered natural gas supply costs under the PGC and $3 million related to over-recovered electric transmission costs. As of December 31, 2014, PECO had a regulatory liability that included $39 million related to the DSP program, $3
million related the over-recovered electric transmission costs and $16 million related to over-recovered natural gas supply costs under the PGC.         
    DSP Program Costs.   These amounts represent recoverable administrative costs incurred relating to the filing and procurement associated
with PECO s PAPUC-approved DSP programs for the procurement of electric supply. The filings and procurements of these DSP Programs are recoverable through the GSA over each respective term. The original DSP Program had a 29-month term that
began January 1, 2011. DSP II and DSP III each have a 24-month term that began June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2015, respectively. The independent evaluator costs associated with conducting procurements are recoverable over a 12-month period
after the PAPUC approves the results of the procurements. PECO is not earning a return on these costs. Certain costs included in PECO s original DSP program related to information technology improvements were recovered over a 5-year period that
began January 1, 2011. PECO earns a return on the recovery of information technology costs. These costs are included within the energy and transmission programs line item.   
        The BGE energy costs represent the electric supply, gas supply, and
transmission related costs recoverable (refundable) from (to) customers under BGE s market-based SOS program, MBR program, and FERC approved transmission rates, respectively. BGE does not earn or pay interest on under- or over-recovered costs
to customers. As of December 31, 2015, BGE s regulatory asset of $40 million included $12 million associated with transmission costs recoverable through its FERC approved formula rate and $28 million related to under-recovered electric
energy costs. As of December 31, 2015, BGE s regulatory liability of $18 million related to $5 million of over-recovered natural gas costs $14 million of over-recovered transmission costs, offset by $1 million of abandonment costs to be
recovered upon FERC approval. As of December 31, 2014, BGE s regulatory asset of $15 million included $10 million related to under-recovered electric energy costs, $4 million of Constellation merger and integration costs and $1 million of
transmission costs recoverable through its FERC approved formula rate. As of December 31, 2014, BGE s regulatory liability of $7 million related to over-recovered natural gas supply costs.   
          Deferred storm costs.   In the MDPSC s March 2011 rate
order, BGE was authorized to defer $16 million in storm costs incurred in February 2010. BGE earns a return on this regulatory asset and the recovery period was extended for an additional 25 months, in accordance with the MDPSC approved 2014
electric and natural gas distribution rate case order.

     Electric generation-related regulatory asset.   As a result of the deregulation of
electric generation, BGE ceased to meet the requirements for accounting for a regulated business for the previous electric generation portion of its business. As a result, BGE wrote-off its entire individual, generation-related regulatory assets and
liabilities and established a single, generation-related regulatory asset to be collected through its regulated rates, which is being amortized on a basis that approximates the pre-existing individual regulatory asset amortization schedules. The
portion of this regulatory asset that does not earn a regulated rate of return was $19 million as of December 31, 2015, and $28 million as of December 31, 2014. BGE will continue to amortize this amount through 2017.   
          Rate stabilization deferral.   In June 2006, Senate Bill 1
was enacted in Maryland and imposed a rate stabilization measure that capped rate increases by BGE for residential electric customers at 15% from July 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007. As a result, BGE recorded a regulatory asset on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the difference between the costs to purchase power and the revenues collected from customers, as well as related carrying charges based on short-term interest rates from July 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. In
addition, as required by Senate Bill 1, the MDPSC approved a plan that allowed residential electric customers the option to further defer the transition to market rates from June 1, 2007 to January 1, 2008. During 2007, BGE deferred $306
million of electricity purchased for resale expenses and certain applicable carrying charges, which are calculated using the implied interest rates of the rate stabilization bonds, as a regulatory asset related to the rate stabilization plans.
During 2015 and 2014, BGE recovered $73 million and $65 million, respectively, of electricity purchased for resale expenses and carrying charges related to the rate stabilization plan regulatory asset. BGE began amortizing the regulatory asset
associated with the deferral which ended in May 2007 to earnings over a period not to exceed ten years when collection from customers began in June 2007.         
    Energy efficiency and demand response programs.   For ComEd, these amounts represent over recoveries related to
ComEd s ICC-approved Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan. ComEd refunds these over recoveries through a rider over a twelve-month period. ComEd earns a return on the capital investment incurred under the program, but does not earn or pay
interest on under or over recoveries, respectively. For PECO, these amounts represent over recoveries of program costs related to both Phase I and Phase II of its PAPUC-approved EE C Plan. PECO began recovering the costs of its Phase I and Phase
II EE C Plans through a surcharge in January 2010 and June 2013, respectively, based on projected spending under the programs. Phase I recovery continued over the life of the program, which expired on May 31, 2013 and excess funds collected
began being refunded in June 2013. Phase II of the program began on June 1, 2013, and will continue over the life of the program, which will expire on May 31, 2016. Excess funds collected are required to be refunded beginning in June 2016.
PECO earned a return on the capital investment incurred under Phase I of the program. PECO does not earn (pay) interest on under (over) collections. For BGE, these amounts represent under (over) recoveries related to BGE s Smart Energy Savers
Program     , which includes both MDPSC-approved demand response and energy efficiency programs. For the BGE Peak
Rewards   SM    demand response program which began in January 2008, actual
marketing and customer bonus costs incurred in the demand response program are being recovered over a 5-year amortization period from the date incurred pursuant to an order by the MDPSC. Fixed assets related to the demand response program are
recovered over the life of the equipment. Also included in the demand response program are customer bill credits related to BGE s Smart Energy Rewards program which began in July 2013 and are being recovered through the surcharge. Actual costs
incurred in the energy efficiency program are being amortized over a 5-year period with recovery beginning in 2010 pursuant to an order by the MDPSC. BGE earns a rate of return on the capital investments and deferred costs incurred under the program
and earns (pays) interest on under (over) collections.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Merger integration costs.   These amounts represent integration costs to achieve
distribution synergies related to the Constellation merger transaction. As a result of the MDPSC s February 2013 rate order, BGE deferred $8 million related to non-severance merger integration costs incurred during 2012 and the first quarter of
2013. Of these costs, $4 million was authorized to be amortized over a  5-year  period that began in March 2013. The recovery of the remaining $4 million was deferred. In the MDPSC s December 2013 rate
order, BGE was authorized to recover the remaining $4 million and an additional $4 million of non-severance merger integration costs incurred during 2013. These costs are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in December 2013. BGE is
earning a return on this regulatory asset included in base rates.              Under (Over)-recovered electric and gas revenue decoupling.   These amounts represent the electric and gas distribution costs recoverable from or (refundable) to customers under BGE s decoupling
mechanism, which does not earn a rate of return. As of December 31, 2015, BGE had a regulatory asset of $30 million related to under-recovered electric revenue decoupling and a regulatory liability of $1 million related to over-recovered
natural gas revenue decoupling. As of December 31, 2014, BGE had a regulatory asset of $7 million related to under-recovered electric revenue decoupling and a regulatory liability of $12 million related to over-recovered natural gas revenue
decoupling.              CAP arrearage.   These amounts
represent the guaranteed recovery of previously incurred bad debt expense associated with the estimated eligible CAP accounts receivable balances under the IPAF Program as provided by the 2015 electric distribution rate case settlement. These costs
are amortized as recovery is received through a combination of customer payments and rate recovery, including through future rate cases if necessary. PECO is not earning a return on this regulatory asset.   
          Nuclear decommissioning.   These amounts represent
estimated future nuclear decommissioning costs for the Regulatory Agreement Units that exceed (regulatory asset) or are less than (regulatory liability) the associated decommissioning trust fund assets. Exelon believes the trust fund assets,
including prospective earnings thereon and any future collections from customers, will be sufficient to fund the associated future decommissioning costs at the time of decommissioning. Exelon is not accruing interest on these costs. See
Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.              Removal costs.   These amounts represent funds ComEd and BGE have received from customers through depreciation rates to cover the future non-legally required cost of removal of property, plant and
equipment which reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes. This liability is reduced as costs are incurred.         
    DLC program costs.   The DLC program costs include equipment, installation, and information technology costs necessary to implement the
DLC Program under PECO s EE C Phase I Plans. PECO received full cost recovery through Phase I collections and will amortize the costs as a credit to the income statement to offset the related depreciation expense during the same period
through September 2025, which is the remaining useful life of the assets. PECO is not paying interest on these over-recovered costs.         
    Electric distribution tax repairs.   PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement required that the expected cash benefit
from the application of Revenue Procedure 2011-43, which was issued on August 19, 2011, to prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. Credits began being reflected in customer bills on January 1, 2012. PECO s
2015 electric distribution rate case settlement requires PECO to pay interest on the unamortized balance of the tax-effected catch-up deduction beginning January 1, 2016.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Gas distribution tax repairs.   PECO s 2010 natural gas distribution rate case
settlement required that the expected cash benefit from the application of new tax repairs deduction methodologies for 2010 and prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the
IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. Credits began being reflected in customer bills on January 1, 2013. No interest will be paid to customers.   
          Revenue subject to refund.   These amounts represent
refunds and associated interest ComEd owes to customers primarily related to the treatment of the post-test year accumulated depreciation issue in the 2007 Rate Case. As of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, ComEd owed $0 million
and $3 million, respectively.             Purchase of Receivables Programs (Exelon,
ComEd, PECO, and BGE)             ComEd, PECO and BGE are
required, under separate legislation and regulations in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively, to purchase certain receivables from retail electric and natural gas suppliers. For retail suppliers participating in the utilities 
consolidated billing, ComEd, PECO and BGE must purchase their customer accounts receivables. ComEd and BGE purchase receivables at a discount to primarily recover uncollectible accounts expense from the suppliers. PECO is required to purchase
receivables at face value and is permitted to recover uncollectible accounts expense from customers through distribution rates. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, and BGE do not record unbilled commodity receivables under their POR programs. Purchased billed
receivables are classified in other accounts receivable, net on Exelon s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables provide information about the purchased receivables of the Registrants as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014.         

(a)  
  PECO s gas POR program became effective on January 1, 2012 and includes a 1% discount on purchased receivables in order to recover the implementation costs of the
program. The implementation costs were fully recovered and the 1% discount was reset to 0%, effective July 2015.     

(b)  
  For ComEd and BGE, reflects the incremental allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded, which is in addition to the purchase discount. For ComEd, the incremental uncollectible
accounts expense is recovered through its Purchase of Receivables with Consolidated Billing (PORCB) tariff.           
     4. Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions (Exelon and Generation)              Proposed Merger with Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon)    
          Description of Transaction     
        On April 29, 2014, Exelon and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) signed
an agreement and plan of merger (as subsequently amended and restated as of July 18, 2014, the Merger Agreement) to

combine the two companies in an all cash transaction. The resulting company will retain the Exelon name. Under the Merger Agreement, PHI s shareholders will receive $27.25 of cash in
exchange for each share of PHI common stock. Based on the outstanding shares of PHI s common stock as of December 31, 2015, PHI shareholders would receive $6.9 billion in total cash. In addition, in connection with the Merger Agreement,
Exelon entered into a subscription agreement under which it has purchased $180 million of a class of nonvoting, nonconvertible and nontransferable preferred securities of PHI. The preferred securities are included in Other non-current assets on
Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet. PHI has the right to redeem the preferred securities at its option for the purchase price paid plus accrued dividends, if any.   
        On November 2, 2015, Exelon and PHI each filed a new Notification
and Report Form with the DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) due to the expiration of the original filing. The HSR Act waiting period expired on December 2, 2015, and the HSR Act no longer precludes
completion of the merger.            To date, the PHI stockholders,
the Virginia State Corporation Commission, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), the Delaware Public Service Commission (DPSC), the Maryland Public Service Commission (MDPSC) and the FERC have approved the merger of PHI and Exelon. The
Federal Communications Commission has also approved the transfer of certain PHI communications licenses.         
  On February 11, 2015, the NJBPU approved the proposed merger and the previously filed settlement signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Atlantic City
Electric (ACE), NJBPU staff, and the Independent Energy Coalition. The settlement provides a package of benefits to ACE customers and the state of New Jersey. This package of benefits includes the establishment of customer rate credit programs, with
an aggregate value of $62 million for ACE customers and energy efficiency programs that will provide savings for ACE customers of $15 million. The March 6, 2015, order by the NJBPU approving the merger required that the consummation of the
merger must take place no later than November 1, 2015 unless otherwise extended by the Board. On October 15, 2015, the NJBPU extended the November 1, 2015 date to June 30, 2016.   
        On February 13, 2015, Exelon and PHI announced that they had
reached a settlement agreement in the proceeding before the DPSC to review the proposed merger. The settlement, which was amended on April 7, 2015, was signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Delmarva Power   Light Company (DPL), the DPSC
Staff, the Delaware Public Advocate, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition and the Clean Air Council. As part of this settlement,
Exelon and PHI proposed a package of benefits to DPL customers and the state of Delaware including the establishment of customer rate credits of $40 million for DPL customers in Delaware, $2 million of funding for energy efficiency programs for DPL
low income customers, and $2 million of funding for workforce development. On June 2, 2015, the DPSC issued an order accepting the settlement and approving the merger between Exelon and PHI.   
        On March 17, 2015, Exelon and PHI announced that they had reached
settlements with multiple parties in the Maryland proceeding to review the proposed merger after filing a Request for Adoption of Settlements with the MDPSC. The settlements were signed and filed by Exelon, PHI, Montgomery County, Prince
George s County, the National Consumer Law Center, National Housing Trust, the Maryland Affordable Housing Coalition, the Housing Association of Nonprofit Developers, and a consortium of recreational trail advocacy organizations led by the
Mid-Atlantic Off-Road Enthusiasts.

Exelon and PHI also announced a settlement with The Alliance for Solar Choice. On May 15, 2015, the MDPSC approved the merger after modifying a number of the conditions in the settlements,
resulting in total rate credits of $66 million, funding for energy efficiency programs of $43.2 million, a Green Sustainability Fund of $14.4 million, 20 MWs of renewable generation development and increased penalties related to reliability
commitments. On May 18, 2015, Exelon and PHI accepted and committed to fulfill the conditions.            On June 11, 2015, the Maryland Office of People s Counsel (OPC), the Sierra Club, and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network filed Petitions for Judicial Review of the MDPSC s approval of the merger
with the Circuit Court for Queen Anne s County. On June 23, 2015, Public Citizen, Inc. filed its Petition for Judicial Review with the Circuit Court for Queen Anne s County. On July 10, 2015, Exelon and PHI filed a response in
opposition to the Petitions for Review.            On July 21,
2015, the OPC filed a motion to stay the MDPSC order approving the merger and to set a schedule for discovery and presentation of new evidence. On July 29, 2015, Public Citizen, Inc. filed a response supporting OPC s motion to stay, and on
July 31, 2015 the Sierra Club and the Chesapeake Climate Action Network filed a joint motion to stay. In July and August, Exelon, PHI, the MDPSC, Prince George s County and Montgomery County filed responses opposing the motions to stay.
The judge issued an order denying the motions for stay on August 12, 2015. On January 8, 2016, the Circuit Court judge affirmed the MDPSC s order approving the merger and denied the petitions for judicial review filed by the OPC, the
Sierra Club, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) and Public Citizen, Inc. On January 19, 2016, the OPC filed a notice of appeal to the Maryland Court of Special appeals, and on January 21, Sierra Club and CCAN filed a notice of
appeal. In the ordinary course this appeal would be resolved no earlier than third quarter 2016.            On August 27, 2015, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission (DCPSC) issued an Opinion and Order denying approval of the merger, concluding that the merger as presented was not in the public
interest. Exelon and PHI filed an Application for Reconsideration with the DCPSC on September 28, 2015. On October 6, 2015, Exelon, PHI, the District of Columbia Government, the Office of Peoples Counsel, the District of Columbia Water and
Sewer Authority, the National Consumer Law Center, National Housing Trust and National Housing Trust Enterprise Preservation Corporation, and the Apartment and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington (collectively, Settling
Parties) entered into a Nonunanimous Full Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (Settlement Agreement) with respect to the merger. Exelon and PHI subsequently filed a motion of joint applicants requesting the DCPSC to reopen the approval application
to allow for consideration of the Settlement Agreement and granting additional requested relief. The new package of benefits totals $78 million and includes commitments to provide relief of residential customer base rate increases of $26 million,
one-time direct bill credits of $14 million, low-income energy assistance of $16 million, improved reliability, a cleaner and greener D.C. through funding energy efficiency programs and development of renewable energy, and investment in local jobs
and the local economy through workforce development of $5 million. It also guarantees charitable contributions totaling $19 million over 10 years.         
  On October 28, 2015, the DCPSC agreed to reopen the approval application to allow for consideration of the Settlement Agreement. Since then,
parties supporting and opposing the Settlement filed testimony, participated in formal hearings and, on December 23, 2015, submitted final briefs to the DCPSC. The parties now await a formal decision from the DCPSC. The Merger Agreement
provides that either Exelon or PHI may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not completed by October 28, 2015. Pursuant to a Letter Agreement related to the Settlement Agreement, Exelon and PHI have agreed, among other things, that
they will not exercise their rights to terminate   
         285

the Merger Agreement before March 4, 2016, except under limited circumstances. If the DCPSC does not approve the Settlement Agreement by March 4, 2016, either Exelon or PHI may
terminate the Settlement Agreement.            The settlements reached
and commission orders received to date in Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey include a  most favored nation  provision which, generally speaking, requires allocation of merger benefits proportionately across all the jurisdictions. When
applying the most favored nation provision to the settlement terms and other conditions established in the merger approvals received to date, and as proposed in the Settlement Agreement filed with the DCPSC, Exelon and PHI currently estimate direct
benefits of $430 million or more on a net present value basis (excluding charitable contributions and renewable generation commitments) will be provided, including rate credits, funding for energy efficiency programs and other required commitments.
Exelon and PHI anticipate substantially all of such amounts will be charged to earnings at the time of merger close and will be paid by the end of 2017. An additional $53 million will be charged to earnings at the time of the merger close for
charitable contributions, which are then required to be paid over a period of 10 years. Commitments to develop renewable generation, which are expected to be primarily capital in nature, will be recognized as incurred. Upon completion of the merger,
the actual nature, amount, timing and financial reporting treatment for these commitments may be materially different from the current projection.         
  Exelon has been named in suits filed in the Delaware Chancery Court alleging that individual directors of PHI breached their fiduciary duties by
entering into the proposed merger transaction and Exelon aided and abetted the individual directors  breaches. The suits seek to enjoin PHI from completing the merger or seek rescission of the merger if completed. In addition, they also seek
unspecified damages and costs. Exelon was also named in a federal court suit making similar claims. In September 2014, the parties reached a proposed settlement that would resolve all claims, which is subject to court approval. Final court approval
of the proposed settlement is not anticipated until approximately 90 days after merger close. Exelon does not believe these suits will impact the completion of the transaction, and they are not expected to have a material impact on Exelon s
results of operations.            Including 2014 and through
December 31, 2015, Exelon has incurred approximately $259 million of expense associated with the proposed merger. Of the total costs incurred, $121 million is primarily related to acquisition and integration costs and $138 million are for costs
incurred to finance the transaction. The financing costs include $22 million of costs associated with the private exchange offer and redemption of certain Senior Unsecured Notes (see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information on
the exchange), as well as, a net loss of $64 million related to the settlement of forward-starting interest-rate swaps. These swaps were terminated in connection with the $4.2 billion issuance of debt; refer to Note 13 Derivative Financial
Instruments for more information. The financing costs exclude costs to issue equity and the initial debt offering which we recorded to Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(a)  
  The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and maintenance expense in the Registrants  respective Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income, with the exception of the financing costs, which are included within Interest expense.           
  Under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, PHI may be required to pay Exelon a termination fee ranging from $259 million to
$293 million plus certain expenses. If the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval, Exelon may be required to pay PHI a termination fee equal to $180 million through the redemption by PHI of the
outstanding nonvoting preferred securities described above for no consideration other than the nominal par value of the stock, plus reimbursement of PHI s documented out-of-pocket expenses up to a maximum of $40 million.   
          Merger Financing     
        Exelon has raised cash to fund the all-cash purchase price,
acquisition and integration related costs, and merger commitments, through the issuance of $4.2 billion of debt (of which $3.3 billion remains after execution of the exchange offer, see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information
on the exchange), $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity units, the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock, cash proceeds of $1.8 billion from asset sales primarily at Generation (after-tax proceeds of
approximately $1.4 billion) and the remaining balance from cash on hand and/or short-term borrowings available to Exelon. Exelon will have sufficient cash to fund the all-cash purchase price, acquisition and integration related costs, and merger
commitments. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 19 Shareholder s Equity for further information on the debt and equity issuances.         
   Acquisitions (Exelon and Generation)          
    Acquisition of Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (Exelon and Generation)              On November 1, 2014, Generation acquired the competitive retail electric and natural gas business activities of
Integrys Energy Group, Inc. through the purchase of all of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services, Inc. (IES) for a purchase price of $332 million, including net working capital. Generation has elected to account for the
transaction as an asset acquisition for federal income tax purposes. The generation and solar asset businesses of Integrys are excluded from the transaction. The Purchase Agreement also includes various representations, warranties, covenants,
indemnification and other provisions customary for a transaction of this nature.            Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined as of the acquisition date through the use of significant estimates and assumptions
that are judgmental in nature. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions used include: projected future cash flows (including the amount and timing); discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future power
and fuel market prices.

acquisition date. The after-tax gain is included within Gain on consolidation and acquisition of businesses in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
        IES s operating revenues and net loss included in Exelon s
and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the period from November 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 were $386 million and $(42) million, respectively. The net loss for the period from
November 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 includes pre-tax unrealized losses on derivative contracts of $108 million and the bargain purchase gain of $28 million. It is impracticable to determine the overall financial statement impact of IES
for 2015 due to the integration of the business into ongoing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon and Generation incurred $5 million and $7 million, respectively, of merger and integration related costs which are
included within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

    Asset Divestitures (Exelon and Generation)             Including the Quail Run generating facility that was sold on January 21, 2015, Generation has sold certain
generating assets with a total net book value of approximately $1.8 billion prior to consideration of asset impairments (See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for further information), for total pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.8
billion (after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion), which resulted in cumulative pre-tax gains on sale of approximately $412 million, which are included in Gain (loss) on sales of assets on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated
Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The proceeds are expected to be used primarily to finance a portion of the merger with PHI.         
          At December 31, 2014, the assets
and liabilities of the Quail Run generating facility were reported as Assets held for sale and within Other current liabilities on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The table below presents the major classes of assets
and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2014. Assets held for sale at December 31, 2015 are not material.

           5. Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC
(Exelon and Generation)             Generation owns a 50.01%
interest in CENG, a nuclear generation business. Generation has historically had various agreements with CENG to purchase power and to provide certain services. For further information regarding these agreements, see Note 26 Related Party
Transactions.            On April 1, 2014, Generation and
subsidiaries of Generation and CENG entered into a Nuclear Operating Services Agreement (NOSA) pursuant to which Generation will operate the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries and provide corporate and administrative services
for

the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to EDF s rights as a member of CENG (the Integration Transaction). CENG will
reimburse Generation for its direct and allocated costs for such services. As part of the arrangement, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC, a subsidiary of CENG, also assigned to Generation its obligations as Operator of Nine Mile Point Unit 2
under an operating agreement with Long Island Power Authority, the Unit 2 co-owner. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the Power Services Agency Agreement (PSAA) was amended and extended until the permanent cessation of power generation by the CENG
generation plants.            In addition, on April 1, 2014,
Generation made a $400 million loan to CENG, bearing interest at 5.25% per annum and payable out of specified available cash flows of CENG or payable upon the maturity date of April 1, 2034. Immediately following receipt of the proceeds of
such loan, CENG made a $400 million special distribution to EDF. Unpaid principal and accrued interest on the loan was $300 million as of December 31, 2015.   
        Exelon, Generation, and subsidiaries of Generation, EDF and CENG also
executed a Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for CENG on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which, among other things, CENG committed to make preferred distributions to Generation (after repayment of the $400 million loan and associated
interest) quarterly out of specified available cash flows until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.5% per annum from April 1, 2014 (Preferred Distribution Rights).   
        Generation and EDF also entered into a Put Option Agreement on
April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has the option, exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement
of the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. The appraisers determining fair market value of EDF s 49.99% interest in CENG under the Put Option Agreement are instructed to take into account all rights and obligations
under the CENG Operating Agreement, including Generation s rights with respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return, and the value of Generation s rights to other distributions. Under limited
circumstances, the period for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months. In order to exercise its option, EDF must give 60 days advance written notice to Generation stating that it is exercising its option. As of the date these
financial statements were issued, EDF has not given notice to Generation that it is exercising its option.         
  On April 1, 2014, Generation also executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation indemnified EDF against third-party claims that
may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this indemnity.   
        In addition, on April 1, 2014, Generation, EDF, CENG and Nine Mile
Point Nuclear Station, LLC entered into an Employee Matters Agreement (EMA) that provides for the transfer of CENG employees to Exelon or one of its affiliates and Exelon s assumption of the sponsorship of the employee benefit plans (including
certain incentive, health and welfare, and postemployment benefit plans, among others) and their related trusts by Exelon as the plan sponsor as of July 14, 2014. The EMA also generally requires CENG to fund the obligation related to
pre-transfer service of employees, including the underfunded balance of the pension and other postretirement welfare benefit plans measured as of July 14, 2014 by making periodic payments to Generation. These payments will be made on an agreed
  
         290

payment schedule or upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as EDF s disposition of a majority of its interest in CENG. However, in the event that EDF exercises its rights
under the Put Option, all payments not made as of the put closing date shall accelerate to be paid immediately prior to such closing date.         
  As a condition to obtaining regulatory approval for the NOSA and related transactions from the NRC, Exelon executed a support agreement pursuant to
which Exelon may be required under specified circumstances to provide up to $245 million of financial support to CENG (Exelon Support Agreement). The Exelon Support Agreement supersedes a previous support agreement under which Generation had agreed
to provide up to $205 million of financial support for CENG. In addition, Exelon executed a Guarantee pursuant to which Exelon may be required under specified circumstances to provide up to $165 million in additional financial support for CENG. A
previous support agreement executed by an affiliate of EDF remains in effect under which the EDF affiliate may be required to provide up to approximately $145 million of financial support for CENG under specified circumstances. The agreements were
executed on April 1, 2014 when the NRC licenses were transferred to Generation. No liability has been recognized by Exelon for the guarantees.         
  Prior to April 1, 2014, Exelon and Generation accounted for their investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. From
January 1, 2014, through March 31, 2014, Generation recorded $19 million of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates related to its investment in CENG and recorded $17 million of revenues from CENG. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2013, Generation recorded $9 million of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates related to its investment in CENG and $56 million of revenues from CENG. The book value of Generation s investment in CENG prior to the
consolidation was $1.9 billion, and the book value of the AOCI related to CENG prior to consolidation was $116 million, net of taxes of $77 million.         
  As a result of the consolidation of CENG on April 1, 2014, there are several additional transactions included in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Financial Statements between CENG and Exelon s affiliates that are considered related party transactions to Generation. As further described in Note 26 Related Party Transactions, EDF and Generation had a PPA
with CENG under which they purchased 15% and 85%, respectively, of the nuclear output owned by CENG that was not sold to third parties under pre-existing PPAs through December 31, 2014. Beginning January 1, 2015 and continuing through the
life of the respective plants, EDF and Generation purchase 49.99% and 50.01%, respectively, of the nuclear output owned by CENG not subject to other contractual agreements. Beginning April 1, 2014, CENG s sales to Generation have been
eliminated in consolidation. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Generation had sales to EDF of $488 million and $137 million, respectively. See discussion above and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for additional information
regarding other transactions between CENG and EDF included within Exelon and Generation s consolidated financial statements and for additional information about the Registrants VIE s.   
          Accounting for the Consolidation of CENG     
        The transfer of the nuclear operating licenses and the execution of
the NOSA on April 1, 2014, resulted in the derecognition of the equity method investment in CENG and the recording of all assets, liabilities and EDF s noncontrolling interest in CENG at fair value on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the consolidation, Exelon and Generation recorded a net gain of $261 million within their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. This gain consists of approximately $136
million related to the step up to fair value basis of   
         291   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Generation s ownership interest in CENG, and approximately $132 million related to the settlement of pre-existing transactions between CENG and Generation. The net gain on the consolidation
of CENG of $261 million is net of a $7 million payment to EDF.            The fair value of CENG s assets and liabilities recorded in consolidation was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows
(including timing); discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future market prices. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and duration of
liabilities assumed.            The valuations necessary to assess the
fair values of certain assets and liabilities were considered preliminary as a result of the short time period between the execution of the NOSA and the end of the second quarter of 2014. The estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities
could be modified for up to one year from April 1, 2014, as more information was obtained about the fair value of assets and liabilities. The principal items that have been revised include the asset retirement obligation liabilities and related
asset retirement costs. These items have been updated with inputs from a third party engineering firm with corresponding adjustments recorded in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for discussion of the
impacts of adjustments recorded during 2014 and 2015 related to updated estimates of the CENG asset retirement obligation liabilities. In the period of such revisions, these and any other material changes to the fair value assessments have resulted
in adjustments to the amounts recorded upon consolidation. In addition, the asset or liability adjustments impacting depreciation and/or accretion expense recorded after the consolidation date have impacted Generation s post-consolidation
results of operations.            Generation recorded the assets and
liabilities of CENG at fair value as of April 1, 2014. The following assets and liabilities of CENG were recorded within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the date of integration, adjusted for the modifications discussed
above:         
          Generation also recorded the fair value
of the noncontrolling interest on its Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $1.5 billion, net of the fair value of $152 million for certain specified additional distribution rights under the Operating Agreement. In addition, the
noncontrolling interest was further reduced by the $400 million special cash distribution to EDF.   
         292

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Due to the Preferred Distribution Rights that Generation has on CENG s available cash, the
earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as well as the corresponding adjustment to Noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets will not be in proportion to
Generation s and EDF s equity ownership interests. Rather, the attribution will consider Generation s Preferred Distribution Rights and allocate net income based on each owner s rights to CENG s net assets. For the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Generation reduced by $18 million and $13 million, respectively, the amount of Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Income. As a result of the consolidation, Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income includes CENG s incremental operating revenues of $509 million and $218 million and
CENG s net income (loss), prior to any intercompany eliminations and any adjustments for noncontrolling interest, of $(11) million and $407 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   
        Exelon and Generation incurred integration-related costs of $2 million
and $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s respective Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income.               6.
Accounts Receivable (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014 included estimated unbilled revenues, representing an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy or services provided to customers, and is net of an allowance
for uncollectible accounts as follows:         

(a)  
  Represents unbilled portion of retail receivables estimated under Exelon s unbilled critical accounting policy.     

(b)  
  Includes the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer and other accounts receivable.     

(c)  
  Excludes the non-current allowance for uncollectible accounts of $8 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014, related to PECO s current installment plan receivables
described below.     

(d)  
  At December 31, 2014, as explained in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, BGE estimated the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying
loss rates to the outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. The change in estimate resulted in a $19 million pre-tax charge to BGE s provision for uncollectible accounts expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, which is included
in Operating and maintenance expense on BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.           
    PECO Installment Plan Receivables (Exelon and PECO).   PECO enters into payment agreements with certain delinquent customers, primarily
residential, seeking to restore their service, as required by the PAPUC. Customers with past due balances that meet certain income criteria are provided the option to enter into an installment payment plan, some of which have terms greater than one
year, to repay past due balances in addition to paying for their ongoing service on a current basis. The receivable balance for these payment agreement receivables is recorded in accounts receivable for the current portion and other deferred debits
and other assets for the noncurrent portion. The net receivable balance for installment plans with terms greater than one year was $15 million at both       
         293

  December 31, 2015 and 2014. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reserve methodology and assessment of the credit quality of the installment plan receivables are consistent with
the customer accounts receivable methodology discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance associated with these receivables at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 of $15
million consists of $1 million, $3 million and $11 million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The balance of the payment agreement is billed to the customer in equal monthly installments over the term of the agreement.
Installment receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 include balances not yet presented on the customer bill, accounts currently billed and an immaterial amount of past due receivables. When     a customer defaults on
its payment agreement, the terms of which are defined by plan type, the entire balance of the agreement becomes due and the balance is reclassified to current customer accounts receivable and reserved for in accordance with the methodology discussed
in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.

cost basis of the buildings was $52 million, and total accumulated amortization was $39 million and $37 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Also includes ComEd s buildings under capital lease with a net carrying value
at December 31, 2015 and 2014, of $7 million and $8 million, respectively. The original cost basis of the buildings was $8 million and total accumulated amortization was $1 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Includes land held for future use and non utility property at ComEd, PECO, and BGE of $57 million, $21 million, and $32 million, respectively. These balances also include capitalized acquisition, development and exploration costs of
$266 million and $242 million related to oil and gas production activities at Generation at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Includes the original cost and progress payments associated with Generation s turbine equipment held for
future use with a carrying value of $146 million and $83 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

future use with a carrying value of $146 million and $83 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.     
          The annual depreciation provisions as a
percentage of average service life for electric generation assets were 3.47%, 3.50% and 3.35% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   
          License Renewals.   Generation s depreciation
provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of its generating stations, which assume the renewal of the licenses for all nuclear generating stations (except for Oyster Creek) and the hydroelectric generating stations. As a result, the receipt
of license renewals has no material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding license renewals.

   Long-Lived Assets (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation evaluates long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. In the second quarter of each year, Generation updates the long-term fundamental energy prices, which includes a thorough evaluation of key assumptions including gas prices, load growth, environmental policy, plant retirements and
renewable growth.            In 2015, the year over year change in
fundamentals did not indicate any impairments. In 2014, the year over year change in fundamentals suggested that the carrying value of certain merchant wind assets may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows and fair value of twelve wind projects, primarily located in West Texas, were less than their respective carrying values at May 31, 2014. As a result, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $151 million
were written down to their fair value of $65 million and a pre-tax impairment charge of $86 million was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income.            In 2013, lower projected wind production and a
decline in power prices suggested that the carrying value of certain wind projects with market price exposure for either all or a portion of the life of the   
         297   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
asset may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of eleven wind projects, primarily located in West Texas and Minnesota, were less than
their respective carrying values at September 30, 2013. As a result, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $75 million were written down to their fair value of $32 million and a pre-tax impairment charge of $43
million, net of the impairment amount attributable to noncontrolling interests for certain of the projects, was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income.            During 2015 and 2014, significant
declines in oil and gas prices suggested that the carrying value of certain Upstream assets may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of various Upstream properties, primarily located in
Oklahoma and Texas, were less than their respective carrying values at December 31, 2015 and 2014. As a result, pre-tax impairment charges of $5 million and $124 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, within Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. After reflecting the impairment charges, Generation has $187 million of Upstream assets
remaining on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015. Further declines in commodity prices could potentially result in future impairments of the Upstream assets.   
        The fair value analysis used in the above impairments was primarily
based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue, generation and production forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. Changes in the assumptions described above could
potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s long-lived assets, which could be material.         
  In 2014, certain non-nuclear generating assets were identified as assets held for sale on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. When long-lived assets are held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets with a carrying amount of approximately $1
billion were written down to their fair value of $556 million and a pre-tax impairment charge of $450 million was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for further information on asset sales.         
   Nuclear Uprate Program (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation is engaged in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear fleet. When economically viable, the
projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and application of expertise gained from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Based on ongoing reviews, the nuclear uprate implementation plan was adjusted
during 2013 to cancel certain projects. The Measurement Uncertainty Recapture (MUR) uprate projects at the Dresden and Quad Cities nuclear stations were cancelled as a result of the cost of additional plant modifications identified during final
design work which, when combined with then current market conditions, made the projects not economically viable. Additionally, the market conditions prompted Generation to cancel the previously deferred extended power uprate projects at the LaSalle
and Limerick nuclear stations. During 2013, Exelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax charge to Operating and maintenance expense and Interest expense within their Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income of approximately $111 million and $8
million, respectively, to accrue remaining costs and reverse the previously capitalized costs.

    Like-Kind Exchange Transaction (Exelon)             Prior to the PECO/Unicom Merger in October 2000, UII, LLC (formerly Unicom Investments, Inc.) (UII), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Exelon, entered into a like-kind exchange transaction pursuant to which approximately $1.6 billion was invested in coal-fired generating station leases located in Georgia and Texas with two separate entities unrelated to Exelon. The
generating stations were leased back to such entities as part of the transaction. See Note 15 Income Taxes for further information. For financial accounting purposes, the investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. UII
holds the leasehold interests in the generating stations in several separate bankruptcy remote, special purpose companies it directly or indirectly wholly owns. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the
lease terms. If the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options, Exelon has the ability to operate the stations and keep or market the power itself or require the lessees to arrange for a third-party to bid on a service contract for a period
following the lease term. In any event, Exelon will be subject to residual value risk if the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options. This risk is partially mitigated by the fair value of the scheduled payments under the service contract.
However, such payments are not guaranteed. Further, the term of the service contract is less than the expected remaining useful life of the plants and, therefore, Exelon s exposure to residual value risk will not be mitigated by payments under
the service contract in this remaining period. In 2000, under the terms of the lease agreements, UII received a prepayment of $1.2 billion for all rent, which reduced the investment in the leases. There are no minimum scheduled lease payments to be
received over the remaining term of the leases.            On
February 26, 2014, UII and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Texas (CPS) finalized an agreement to terminate the leases on the generating station located in Texas, as described above, prior to its expiration dates. As a result of
the lease termination, UII received a net early termination amount of $335 million from CPS and wrote down the net investment in the CPS long-term lease of $336 million in Investments in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets in 2014; resulting
in a pre-tax loss of $1 million being reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in 2014.   
        Pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance, Exelon is required to
review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments at least annually and record an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying
values. Exelon estimates the fair value of the residual values of its direct financing lease investments under the income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis, which takes into consideration significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)
including the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to operate the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include fundamental energy
and capacity prices, fixed and variable costs, capital expenditure requirements, discount rates, tax rates, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the plants. The estimated fair values also reflect the cash flows associated with the service
contract option discussed above given that a market participant would take into consideration all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease agreements.         
  Based on the annual reviews performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014, the estimated residual value of Exelon s direct financing leases
for the Georgia generating stations experienced other than temporary declines given increases in estimated long-term operating and maintenance costs in the 2015 annual review and reduced long-term energy and capacity price expectations in the 2014
annual review. As a result, Exelon recorded $24 million pre-tax impairment charges in both 2015 and   
         299

2014 for these stations. These impairment charges were recorded within Investments and Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, respectively. Changes in the assumptions described above could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon s direct financing lease investments, which could be material. Through
December 31, 2015, no events have occurred that would require Exelon to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments subsequent to the review performed in the second quarter of 2015.   
        At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the components of the net
investment in long-term leases were as follows:         
             9. Implications of
Potential Early Plant Retirements (Exelon and Generation)             Exelon and Generation continue to evaluate the current and expected economic value of each of Generation s nuclear plants. Factors that will continue to affect the economic value of Generation s nuclear
plants include, but are not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative solutions in New York and Illinois such as the proposed Low Carbon Portfolio Standard (LCPS) legislation, the impact of final rules from
the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of the states to implement those final rules, and the outcome of the Ginna RSSA hearing and settlement procedures and the resulting contractual terms and conditions. On
September 10, 2015, after considering the results of the recent PJM capacity auctions, Exelon and Generation decided to defer decisions about the future operations of its Quad Cities and Byron nuclear plants and will offer both plants in the
2019/2020 auction in May 2016. As a result of clearing the other PJM capacity auction in September 2015 for the 2017/2018 transitional capacity auction, Exelon and Generation will continue to operate its Quad Cities nuclear power plant through at
least May 2018. The Byron plant is already obligated to operate through May 2019. On October 29, 2015, Exelon and Generation announced the deferral of any decision about the future operations of its Clinton nuclear plant and plans to bid the
plant into the MISO capacity auction for the 2016-2017 planning year in April 2016. This decision was driven by MISO s acknowledgment of the need for market design changes to ensure long-term power system reliability in southern Illinois, the
desire to provide Illinois policy makers with additional time to consider needed reforms as well as the potential long-term impact of EPA s Clean Power Plan. Exelon and Generation previously committed to cease operation of the Oyster Creek
nuclear plant by the end of 2019. Exelon and Generation have not made any decisions regarding potential nuclear plant closures at other sites at this time.         
  As a result of a decision to early retire one or more other nuclear plants, certain changes in accounting treatment would be triggered and
Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by a number of items including, among other items: accelerated depreciation expense, impairment charges related to inventory that cannot be used at
other nuclear units and cancellation of in-flight capital projects, accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel costs, employee-related costs (i.e. severance, relocation, retention, etc.), accelerated asset retirement obligation expense
related to future decommissioning activities, and additional funding of nuclear decommissioning trust funds. In addition, any early plant retirement would also result in reduced   
         300

operating costs, lower fuel expense, and lower capital expenditures in the periods beyond shutdown. While there are a number of Generation s nuclear plants that are at risk of early
retirement, the following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2015 for significant assets and liabilities associated with the three nuclear plants currently considered by management to be at the greatest risk of early
retirement due to their current economic valuations and other factors:         

(a)  
  Assumes Clinton seeks and receives a 20-year operating license renewal extension.     
        In the event a decision is made to retire early one or more nuclear
plants, the precise timing of the retirement date, and resulting financial statement impact, is uncertain and would be influenced by a number of factors such as the results of any transmission system reliability study assessments, the nature of any
co-owner requirements and stipulations, and decommissioning trust fund requirements, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does not have capacity obligations and
just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage date in that year.         
     10. Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant (Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE s undivided ownership interests
in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Generation also owns a proportionate share in the fossil fuel combustion turbine at Salem, which is fully depreciated. The gross book value was $3 million at December 31,
2015 and 2014.     
         301   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(b)  
  PECO and BGE own a 22% and 7% share, respectively, in 127 miles of 500kV lines located in Pennsylvania; PECO and BGE also own a 20.7% and 10.56% share, respectively, of a 500kV
substation immediately outside of the Conemaugh fossil generating station which supplies power to the 500kV lines including, but not limited to, the lines noted above.     

(c)  
  PECO owns a 42.55% share in 131 miles of 500kV lines located in Delaware and New Jersey as well as a 42.55% share in a 500kV substation immediately outside of the Salem nuclear
generating station in New Jersey which supplies power to the 500kV lines including, but not limited to, the lines noted above.     

(d)  
  Generation has a 44.24% ownership interest in assets located at Merrill Creek Reservoir located in New Jersey.     

(e)  
  Excludes asset retirement costs.     

(f)  
  On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet, and as of that date, CENG s operations are consolidated into Generation s
financial statements. As of December 31, 2013, Generation s ownership interest in CENG, including Nine Mile Point, was treated as an equity method investment, and thus did not represent an undivided Interest. See Note 5 Investment in
Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for additional information.              Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s and BGE s undivided ownership interests are financed with their funds and all operations are accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly-owned
facilities. Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s and BGE s share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are included in Purchased power and fuel and Operating and maintenance expenses on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and in Operating and maintenance expenses on PECO s and BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
           11. Intangible Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and
PECO)              Goodwill    
        Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s gross amount of
goodwill, accumulated impairment losses and carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom (predecessor parent company of ComEd) merger net of amortization, resolution of tax matters and other
non-impairment-related changes as allowed under previous authoritative guidance.              Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the
ComEd reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance for goodwill, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for
impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial   
         302   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment for its combined business. There is no level below this
operating segment for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, ComEd s operating segment is considered its only reporting unit.   
        Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first
performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step one of the two-step fair value based impairment test). If an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the
reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step fair value based impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.   
        If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the
qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value based test is performed. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to
its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase
price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Any
goodwill impairment charge at ComEd will affect Exelon s consolidated results of operations.            ComEd s valuation approach is based on a market participant view, pursuant to authoritative guidance for fair value measurement, and utilizes a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a
market multiples analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis relies on a single scenario reflecting  base case  or  best estimate  projected cash flows for ComEd s business and includes an estimate of ComEd s terminal
value based on these expected cash flows using the generally accepted Gordon Dividend Growth formula, which derives a valuation using an assumed perpetual annuity based on the entity s residual cash flows. The discount rate is based on the
generally accepted Capital Asset Pricing Model and represents the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. The market multiples analysis utilizes multiples of business enterprise value to earnings, before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of comparable companies in estimating fair value. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected
operating and capital cash flows from ComEd s business and the fair value of debt. Management performs a reconciliation of the sum of the estimated fair value of all Exelon reporting units to Exelon s enterprise value based on its trading
price to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow analysis and the market multiple analysis.         
    2015 and 2014 Goodwill Impairment Assessment.   Pursuant to authoritative guidance, ComEd is required to test its goodwill for
impairment annually and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that suggest an impairment is more likely than not. ComEd performs its assessment as of November 1, of each year. For its 2015 and 2014 annual goodwill
impairment assessments, ComEd qualitatively determined that its fair value was not more likely than not less than its carrying value. Therefore, ComEd did not perform quantitative assessments. As part of its qualitative assessments, ComEd evaluated,
among other things, management s best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s business, as well as, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer company EBITDA
multiples, while also considering the passing margin from its last quantitative assessment performed as of November 1, 2013.

    Other Intangible Assets    
        Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s other intangible
assets and liabilities, included in Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and Other deferred debits and other assets in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015:   

(a)  
  On May 31, 2015, Exelon entered into a long-term software license agreement. Exelon is required to make payments starting August 2015 through May 2024. The intangible asset
recognized as a result of these payments is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.     

(b)  
  Includes unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Excludes $44 million of other miscellaneous
unamortized energy contracts that have been acquired at various points in time. The estimated amortization for these miscellaneous unamortized energy contracts is $3 million, $0 million, $2 million, $3 million and $4 million for 2016, 2017, 2018,
2019 and 2020, respectively.     

(c)  
  In December 2010, Generation acquired all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (later named Exelon Wind), adding 735MWs of installed, operating wind capacity
located in eight states.     

(d)  
  In September 2011, Generation acquired all of the interest in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One, a 242 MW solar project under development in northern Los Angeles County, CA from
First Solar, Inc.     

(e)  
  On March 12, 2012, Constellation merged into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan
of Merger. Since the merger transaction, Generation includes the former Constellation generation and customer supply operations.     

(f)  
  See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for additional information.     

(g)  
  See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.     

(h)  
  Excludes $12 million of other miscellaneous customer relationships that have been acquired. The estimated amortization for these miscellaneous customer relationships is $1
million in each of the years from 2016 to 2020.     

(i)  
    In March 1999, ComEd entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Chicago associated with ComEd s franchise agreement. Under the terms of the
settlement, ComEd agreed to make payments to the City of Chicago each year from      
         304   

Table of Contents

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

1999 to 2002. The intangible asset recognized as a result of these payments is being amortized ratably over the remaining term of the franchise agreement, which ends in 2020.

(j)  
  In February 2003, ComEd entered into separate agreements with the City of Chicago and with Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation). Under the terms of the settlement
agreement with the City of Chicago, ComEd agreed to pay the City of Chicago a total of $60 million over a ten-year period, beginning in 2003. The intangible asset recognized as a result of the settlement agreement is being amortized ratably over the
remaining term of the City of Chicago franchise agreement, which ends in 2020. As required by the settlement, ComEd also made a payment of $2 million to a third-party on the City of Chicago s behalf. Under the terms of the agreement with
Midwest Generation, ComEd received payments of $32 million from Midwest Generation to relieve Midwest Generation s obligation under the 1999 fossil sale agreement with ComEd to build the generation facility in the City of Chicago. The payments
received by ComEd, which have been recorded in Other deferred credits and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on Exelon s and ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheets are being recognized ratably (approximately $2 million
annually) as an offset to amortization expense over the remaining term of the franchise agreement.     

(k)  
  Weighted-average amortization period was calculated at the date of a) acquisition for acquired assets or b) settlement agreement.     
        The following table summarizes the amortization expense related to
intangible assets and liabilities for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  At Exelon, amortization of unamortized energy contracts totaling $22 million, $135 million and $430 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively, was recorded in Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. At Generation, amortization of unamortized energy contracts totaling $22 million,
$135 million and $507 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was recorded in Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income                Acquired
Intangible Assets              Accounting guidance for business
combinations requires the acquirer to separately recognize identifiable intangible assets in the application of purchase accounting.         
   Unamortized Energy Contracts.  Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized fair value of
non-derivative energy contracts that Generation has acquired. The valuation of unamortized energy contracts was estimated by applying either the market approach or the income approach depending on the nature of the underlying contract. The market
approach was utilized when prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable transactions were available. Otherwise, the income approach, which is based upon discounted projected future cash flows associated
with the underlying contracts, was utilized. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key estimates and inputs include forecasted power and fuel prices
and the discount rate. The Exelon Wind unamortized energy contracts are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which the associated contract revenues are recognized as a decrease in Operating revenue within Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. In the case of Antelope Valley, Constellation, CENG and Integrys, the fair value amounts are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the present value of
the underlying cash flows as of the acquisition dates through either Operating revenues or Purchase power and fuel expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
         305

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Customer Relationships.  The customer relationship intangible was determined based on a
 multi-period excess method  of the income approach. Under this method, the intangible asset s fair value is determined to be the estimated future cash flows that will be earned on the current customer base, taking into account
expected contract renewals based on customer attrition rates and costs to retain those customers. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key
assumptions include the customer attrition rate and the discount rate. The accounting guidance requires that customer-based intangibles be amortized over the period expected to be benefited using the pattern of economic benefit. The amortization of
the customer relationships is recorded in Depreciation and amortization expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.             Trade Name.  The Constellation trade name intangible was determined based on the relief from royalty method of
income approach whereby fair value is determined to be the present value of the license fees avoided by owning the assets. The fair value is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable
accounting guidance. Key assumptions include the hypothetical royalty rate and the discount rate. The Constellation trade name intangible is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years. The amortization of the trade name is recorded
in Depreciation and amortization expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.         
    Renewable Energy Credits and Alternative Energy Credits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).     
        Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s other
intangible assets, included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, include RECs (Exelon, Generation and ComEd) and AECs (Exelon and PECO). Purchased RECs are recorded at cost on the
date they are purchased. The cost of RECs purchased on a stand-alone basis is based on the transaction price, while the cost of RECs acquired through PPAs represents the difference between the total contract price and the market price of energy at
contract inception. Revenue for RECs that are part of a bundled power sale is recognized when the power is produced and delivered to the customer. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, PECO had current AECs of $2 million and $13 million,
respectively. PECO had no noncurrent AECs as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, Generation had current RECs of $251 million and $191 million, respectively, and $56 million and $44 million of noncurrent
REC s, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd had current RECs of $5 million and $4 million, respectively. ComEd had no noncurrent RECs as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note
23 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on RECs and AECs.

Short-Term Liabilities.  The short-term
liabilities included in the tables above are comprised of dividends payable (included in other current liabilities) (Level 1), short-term borrowings (Level 2) and third party financing (Level 3). The Registrants  carrying amounts of the
short-term liabilities are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.           
   Long-Term Debt.  The fair value amounts of Exelon s taxable debt securities (Level 2) are determined by a valuation model that is based
on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. In order to incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants into the discount rates, Exelon obtains pricing (i.e., U.S. Treasury rate plus
credit spread) based on trades of existing Exelon debt securities as well as debt securities of other issuers in the electric utility sector with similar credit ratings in both the primary and secondary market, across the Registrants  debt
maturity spectrum. The credit spreads of various tenors obtained from this information are added to the appropriate benchmark U.S. Treasury rates in order to determine the current market yields for the various tenors. The yields are then converted
into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note. The fair value of Exelon s equity units (Level 1) are valued based on publicly traded securities issued by
Exelon.              The fair value of Generation s
non-government-backed fixed rate nonrecourse debt (Level 3) is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles. Given the low trading volume in the nonrecourse debt market, the price quotes used to
determine fair value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly impact the project cash flows or off-taker credit, and other circumstances related to the project
(e.g., political and regulatory environment). The fair value of Generation s government-backed fixed rate project financing debt (Level 3) is largely based on a discounted cash flow methodology that is similar to the taxable debt securities
methodology described above. Due to the lack of market trading data on similar debt, the discount rates are derived based on the original loan interest rate spread to the applicable Treasury rate as well as a current market curve derived from
government-backed securities. Variable rate project financing debt resets on a quarterly basis and the carrying value approximates fair value (Level 2). Generation also has tax-exempt debt (Level 2). Due to low trading volume in this market,
qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to the issuer (e.g., conduit issuer political and regulatory environment), may be incorporated into the credit spreads that are used to obtain the fair value
as described above.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    SNF Obligation.  The carrying amount of Generation s SNF obligation (Level 2) is
derived from a contract with the DOE to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. When determining the fair value of the obligation, the future carrying amount of the SNF obligation estimated to be settled in
2025 is calculated by compounding the current book value of the SNF obligation at the 13-week Treasury rate. The compounded obligation amount is discounted back to present value using Generation s discount rate, which is   calculated using
the same methodology as described above for the taxable debt securities, and an estimated maturity date of 2025.           
   Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts.  Exelon s long-term debt to financing trusts is valued based on publicly traded securities issued by
the financing trusts. Due to low trading volume of these securities, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to each issue, this debt is classified as Level 3.     
          Recurring Fair Value Measurements     
        Exelon records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance
with the hierarchy established by the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:   

Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to liquidate as of the
reporting date.            

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
corroboration with observable market data.            

Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market
activity for the asset or liability.            
  Transfers in and out of levels are recognized as of the end of the reporting period when the transfer occurred. Given derivatives categorized within
Level 1 are valued using exchange-based quoted prices within observable periods, transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 were not material. Transfers into Level 2 from Level 3 generally occur when the contract tenure becomes more observable. Transfers
into Level 3 from Level 2 generally occur due to changes in market liquidity or assumptions for certain commodity contracts. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2015 for cash equivalents,
nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, pledged assets for Zion Station decommissioning, Rabbi trust investments, and deferred compensation obligations.

          Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value
             The following describes the valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.             Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).  The Registrants  cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in
the fair value tables are comprised of investments in mutual and money market funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
            Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and
Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Generation s and CENG s nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold
debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in Equities, Fixed Income and Other. Generation s and CENG s NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for
the trusts and limit the trust funds  exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income
securities are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.           
  With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds
from market exchanges, which Generation is able to independently corroborate. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. Equity securities held
individually are primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-Global Select Market, which contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges.   
        For fixed income securities, multiple prices from pricing services are
obtained whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. With respect to individually held
fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees
determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Generation has obtained an understanding of how these prices are   
         316

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Generation selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other
market-based price sources. U.S. Treasury securities are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, are based on evaluated
prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The fair values of private placement fixed income securities, which are
included in Corporate debt, are determined using a third party valuation that contains significant unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.         
  Equity, balanced and fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in
accordance with a stated set of fund objectives such as holding short term fixed income securities or tracking the performance of certain equity indices by purchasing equity securities to replicate the capitalization and characteristics of the
indices. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For commingled funds and mutual funds,
which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value, which is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities. These investments typically
can be redeemed monthly with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions, and, as a result are categorized as Level 2.         
  Derivative instruments consisting primarily of interest rate swaps to manage risk are recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments are valued
based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.            Middle market lending are investments in loans or managed funds which lend to private companies. Generation elected the fair value option for its investments in certain limited partnerships that invest in middle
market lending managed funds. The fair value of these loans is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models. Investments in middle market lending are categorized as Level 3 because the
fair value of these securities is based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. Investments in middle market lending typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan.   
        Private equity and real estate investments include those in limited
partnerships that invest in operating companies and real estate holding companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange, such as,leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, investments in natural resources,
and direct investments in pools of real estate properties. The fair value of private equity and real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are
generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date. Private equity and real estate valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such
as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data, and independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. Since these valuation inputs are not highly observable, private equity and real estate
investments have been categorized as Level 3.            As of
December 31, 2015, Generation has outstanding commitments to invest in middle market lending, corporate debt securities, private equity investments, and real estate investments of approximately $266 million. These commitments will be funded by
Generation s existing nuclear decommissioning trust funds.

    Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Generation evaluated its NDT portfolios for the existence of
significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2015. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual
fund. As of December 31, 2015, there were no significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in Generation s NDT assets.      
        See Note 16 Asset Retirement Obligations for further discussion on
the NDT fund investments.             Rabbi Trust Investments
(Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE).  The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts
assets are included in investments in the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of mutual funds and life insurance policies. The mutual funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in
accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. Mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices. The life
insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, which is provided by a third party. The cash surrender value inputs are not observable.     
         Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, and ComEd) .
Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain
derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask, mid-point prices and
are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between
market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option
valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For
derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs are generally observable.   Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants  derivatives are predominately at liquid trading
points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid
trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.           
  Exelon may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted
level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated
as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on and discounted by the market s expectation of future interest rates.
Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps
are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion on mark-to-market derivatives.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Deferred Compensation Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).  The
Registrants  deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The value of the Registrants  deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of   the participants  notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual
funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2
in the fair value hierarchy.                Additional
Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd)               Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd).  For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs,
the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to
the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs
generally are not observable. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the
chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the
Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio, are reviewed and verified by the middle
office, and used for financial reporting by the back office. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its
assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.     
        Disclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants  significant
Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and other attributes. Generation s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas, coal
purchases and certain transmission congestion contracts. Generation utilizes various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks
inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancements.
           For commodity derivatives, the primary input to the
valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument. Forward commodity price curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are
reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the
derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by   
         319

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for assets and
Generation s own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry
Hub (for natural gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less
liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically represent a majority of the
instrument s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is generally immaterial. An
average spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $2.91 and $0.27 for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a majority of the fair value
may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for information regarding the maturity by year of the
Registrant s mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities.            On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note
13 Derivative Financial Instruments for more information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using
natural gas heat rates to project long term forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to
the positions based on the tenor and supplier risk.            The
table below discloses the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these positions.

  The fair values do not include cash collateral posted on level three positions of $172 million as of December 31, 2014     

(d)  
  The upper ends of the ranges are driven by the winter power and gas prices in the New England region. Without the New England region, the upper ends of the ranges for power and
gas would be approximately $97 and $8.14, respectively and would be approximately $76 for power proprietary trading.           
  The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly
higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity).
Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of
prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices
of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.         
   Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  For middle market
lending, certain corporate debt securities, real estate and private equity investments the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models and income models. The valuation estimates are based on
valuations of comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company or its assets, considering offers from third parties to buy the portfolio
company, its historical and projected

 financial results, as well as other factors that may impact value. Significant judgment is required in the application of discounts or premiums applied to the prices of comparable companies
for factors such as size, marketability, credit risk and relative performance.              Because Generation relies on third-party fund managers to develop the quantitative unobservable inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant
unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Generation. This includes information regarding the sensitivity of the fair values to changes in the unobservable inputs. Generation gains an understanding of the
fund managers  inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations. Generation performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. For a sample of its Level 3 investments, Generation reviewed independent valuations and
reviewed the assumptions in the detailed pricing models used by the fund managers.               13. Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk related to
ongoing business operations.              Commodity Price Risk
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              To the
extent the amount of energy Generation produces differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon and Generation are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. Each of the
Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options and
short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are classified as either economic hedges or non-derivatives, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in
commodity prices.            Derivative accounting guidance requires
that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and
designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include normal purchase normal sale (NPNS), cash flow hedge, and fair value
hedge. For commodity transactions, Generation no longer utilizes the special election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to the Constellation merger. Because the underlying
forecasted transactions remained probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in Accumulated OCI and was reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity
occurred. The effect of this decision is that all derivative economic hedges related to commodities are recorded at fair value through earnings for the combined company, referred to as economic hedges in the following tables. The Registrants have
applied the NPNS scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power procurement agreements, and natural gas supply agreements. Non-derivative contracts for access to additional generation and certain sales to
load-serving entities are accounted for primarily under the accrual method of accounting, which is further discussed in Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies. Additionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary
trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio, but represent a small portion of Generation s overall energy marketing activities.

    Economic Hedging.  The Registrants are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to
changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental
policies, and other factors. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. As such, Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation
facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and energy purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. In order to manage these risks, Generation may enter into
fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of energy and gas and purchases of fuel and energy. The objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a
portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on electric generation operations, fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of power plants, and fixing   the
price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply load-serving customers. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s policies and hedging objectives, the market, weather conditions, operational
and other factors. Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include
derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an accrual basis.     
        In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a
positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity price risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2015,
the proportion of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 90%-93%, 60%-63% and 28%-31% for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the
expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted for capacity based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market
conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including Generation s
sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.            On
December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012.
Pursuant to the ICC s Order on December 19, 2012, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts for energy and associated RECs were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. In addition, the
ICC s December 18, 2013 Order approved the reduction of ComEd s commitments under those contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, and the amount of the reductions was approved in March 2014. These contracts are
designed to lock in a portion of the long-term commodity price risk resulting from the renewable energy resource procurement requirements in the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial
instruments. ComEd records the fair value of the swap contracts on its balance sheet. Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd
as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.

   PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive
procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Programs, which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters. Based on Pennsylvania legislation and the DSP Programs permitting PECO to recover its electric supply procurement costs
from retail customers with no mark-up, PECO s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. PECO locked in fixed prices for a significant portion of its commodity price risk through full requirements contracts and block
contracts. PECO has certain full requirements contracts and block contracts that are considered derivatives and qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance.   
        PECO s natural gas procurement policy is designed to achieve a
reasonable balance of long-term and short-term gas purchases under different pricing approaches in order to achieve system supply reliability at the least cost. PECO s reliability strategy is two-fold. First, PECO must assure that there is
sufficient transportation capacity to satisfy delivery requirements. Second, PECO must ensure that a firm source of supply exists to utilize the capacity resources. All of PECO s natural gas supply and asset management agreements that are
derivatives either qualify for the NPNS scope exception and have been designated as such, or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced. Additionally, in accordance with the 2015 PAPUC PGC settlement and to reduce the
exposure of PECO and its customers to natural gas price volatility, PECO has continued its program to purchase natural gas for both winter and summer supplies using a layered approach of locking-in prices ahead of each season with long-term gas
purchase agreements (those with primary terms of at least twelve months). Under the terms of the 2015 PGC settlement, PECO is required to lock in (i.e., economically hedge) the price of a minimum volume of its long-term gas commodity purchases.
PECO s gas-hedging program is designed to cover about 30% of planned natural gas purchases in support of projected firm sales. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on PECO s financial position or results of
operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.            BGE has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC. The SOS rates charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include
an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a shareholder return component for commercial and industrial rate classes. BGE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. BGE locks in
fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts. Certain of BGE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative
guidance. Other BGE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.            BGE provides natural gas to its customers under a MBR mechanism approved by the MDPSC. Under this mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a
given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers. BGE must also secure fixed price contracts for at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of forecasted system supply
requirements for flowing (i.e., non-storage) gas for the November through March period. These fixed-price contracts are not subject to sharing under the MBR mechanism. BGE also ensures it has sufficient pipeline transportation capacity to meet
customer requirements. All of BGE s natural gas supply and asset management agreements qualify for the NPNS scope exception and result in physical delivery.   
         Proprietary Trading.  Generation also enters into certain
energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or
managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The

 proprietary trading activities, which included settled physical sales volumes of 7,310 GWh, 10,571 GWh and 8,762 GWh for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, are a
complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s revenue from energy marketing activities. ComEd, PECO and BGE do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. 
              Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              The Registrants
use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate
exposure. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to manage interest rate
risks. At December 31, 2015, Exelon had $800 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and Exelon and Generation had $738 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and
cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in an approximately $6 million
decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2015. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign
currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. Below is a summary of the interest rate and foreign exchange hedge balances as of December 31, 2015:   

(a)  
  Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. The characterization of
the interest rate derivative contracts between the proprietary trading activity in the above table is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does
not utilize proprietary trading interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates.     

(b)  
  Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions
with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as accrued interest,
transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of non-cash collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.

   The following table provides a summary of the interest rate and foreign exchange hedge balances
recorded by the Registrants as of December 31, 2014:         

(a)  
  Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. The characterization of
the interest rate derivative contracts between the proprietary trading activity in the above table is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does

(b)  
  Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions
with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as accrued interest,
transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of non-cash collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.     
         Fair Value Hedges . For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. Exelon includes the gain or loss on the
hedged items and the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps in interest expense as follows:           

(a)  
  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the loss on Generation swaps included $(1) million and $(17) million realized in earnings, respectively, with an immaterial
amount and $4 million excluded from hedge effectiveness testing, respectively.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   At December 31, 2015, Exelon had total outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges
related to interest rate swaps of $800 million, with a derivative asset of $25 million. At December 31, 2014, Exelon and Generation had outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $1,450 million and $550
million, with a derivative asset of $29 million and $7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the impact on the results of operations, as a result of the ineffectiveness from fair value hedges, was a $17
million gain and $18 million gain, respectively.             Cash
Flow Hedges . During 2014, Exelon entered into $400 million of floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with the anticipated refinancing of existing debt. The swaps are
designated as cash flow hedges. In January 2015, in connection with Generation s $750 million issuance of five-year Senior Unsecured Notes, Exelon terminated these swaps. As the original forecasted transactions were a series of future interest
payments over a ten year period, a portion of the anticipated interest payments are probable not to occur. As a result, $26 million of anticipated payments were reclassified from Accumulated OCI to Other, net in Exelon s Consolidated Statement
of Operations and Comprehensive Income.              During the
third quarter of 2014, ExGen Texas Power, LLC, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the long-term borrowing. See Note 14 Debt and
Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $500 million as of December 31, 2015 and expire in 2019. The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge in the fourth quarter of 2014. At
December 31, 2015, the subsidiary had a $12 million derivative liability related to the swap.            During the first quarter of 2014, ExGen Renewables I, LLC, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with the
long-term borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a notional amount of $189 million as of December 31, 2015 and expire in 2020. The swaps are designated as cash
flow hedges. At December 31, 2015, the subsidiary had a $2 million derivative liability related to the swaps.         
  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges
in continuing designated hedge relationships were immaterial.         
   Economic Hedges.  During the third quarter of 2011, Sacramento PV Energy, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into floating-to-fixed interest
rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection   with the long-term borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding the financing. The swaps have a total notional amount
of $25 million as of December 31, 2015 and expire in 2027. After the closing of the Constellation merger, the swaps were re-designated as cash flow hedges. During the first quarter of 2015, the swaps were de-designated as the forecasted
transaction was no longer probable of occurring. All future changes in fair value are reflected in Interest expense. At December 31, 2015, the subsidiary had a $2 million derivative liability related to these swaps, which included an immaterial
amount that was amortized to Interest expense after de-designation.              During the third quarter of 2012, Constellation Solar Horizons, a subsidiary of Generation, entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to manage a portion of its interest rate exposure in connection with
the long-term borrowings. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information

regarding the financing. The swap has a notional amount of $24 million as of December 31, 2015, and expires in 2030. This swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. During the first quarter
of 2015, the swaps were de-designated as the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring. All future changes in fair value are reflected in Interest expense. At December 31, 2015, the derivative asset related to the swap was
immaterial.            During the second quarter 2015, upon the
issuance of debt, Exelon terminated $2,400 million of floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination of the swaps, Exelon realized a $64 million loss during the second quarter of 2015.   
        At December 31, 2015, Generation had immaterial notional amounts
of interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions and $30 million in notional amounts of foreign currency exchange rate swaps that are marked-to-market to manage the
exposure associated with international purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. dollars.         
    Fair Value Measurement and Accounting for the Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (Exelon Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
             Fair value accounting guidance and disclosures
about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative instruments to be shown in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable
master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other providing for
the net settlement of all referencing contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. Generation s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless
Generation is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1). In the table below, Generation s energy related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the
same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral including initial margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting column. As of December 31,
2015 and 2014, $3 million and $8 million of cash collateral posted, respectively, was not offset against derivative positions because such collateral was not associated with any energy-related derivatives, were associated with accrual positions, or
as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. Excluded from the tables below are economic hedges that qualify for the NPNS scope exception and other non-derivative contracts that are accounted for under the accrual method of
accounting.            ComEd s use of cash collateral is
generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1).            Cash collateral held by PECO and BGE must be deposited in a non affiliate major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meet certain qualifications.

   The following table provides a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded by the
Registrants as of December 31, 2015:         

(a)  
  Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions
with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures, subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as trade receivables
and payables, transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of non-cash collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.     

(b)  
  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $352 million and $180 million, respectively, and current and noncurrent liabilities are shown net of collateral of
$480 million and $222 million, respectively. The total cash collateral posted, net of cash collateral received and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $1,234 million at December 31, 2015.     

(c)  
  Includes current and noncurrent liabilities relating to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.

  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $416 million and $171 million, respectively, and current and noncurrent liabilities are shown net of collateral of
$599 million and $220 million, respectively. The total cash collateral posted, net of cash collateral received and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $1,406 million at December 31, 2014.     

(c)  
  Includes current and noncurrent liabilities relating to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     
         Cash Flow Hedges (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).  As discussed
previously, effective prior to the Constellation merger, Generation de-designated all of its cash flow hedges relating to commodity price risk. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remain at least reasonably probable, the fair value of the
effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in Accumulated OCI and is reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. Generation began
recording prospective changes in the fair value of these instruments through current earnings from the date of de-designation. As of December 31, 2015, no unrealized balance remains in accumulated OCI to be reclassified by Generation.

  Amount is net of related income tax expense of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.              During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, Generation s former energy-related cash flow hedge
activity impact to pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from Accumulated OCI to earnings was a $2 million, $195 million and $683 million pre-tax gain, respectively. In addition, the effect of Exelon s former energy-related
cash flow hedge activity impact on pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from Accumulated OCI to earnings was a $2 million, $195 million and $464 million pre-tax gain for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Given that the cash flow hedges had primarily consisted of forward power sales and power swaps and did not include power and gas options or sales, neither Exelon nor Generation will incur changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness in
future periods relating to energy-related hedge positions as all were de-designated prior to the merger date.         
   Economic Hedges (Exelon and Generation).  These instruments represent hedges that economically mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices and include financial options, futures, swaps, physical forward sales and purchases, but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. Additionally, Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts and foreign
exchange currency swaps ( treasury ) to manage the exposure related to the interest rate component of commodity positions and international purchases of commodities in currencies other

Credit Risk (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)              The Registrants would be
exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting
date. For energy-related derivative instruments, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with its

counterparties, which reduces Generation s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty.
Typically, each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a
counterparty that allow for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each
counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability,
credit ratings by credit rating agencies, and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling
agreement. Generation s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.   
        The following tables provide information on Generation s credit
exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2015. The tables further delineate that exposure by
credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail counterparties, Nuclear fuel procurement
contracts and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE and Nodal commodity exchanges, further discussed in ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Additionally, the figures in the tables below exclude exposures
with affiliates, including net receivables with ComEd, PECO and BGE of $15 million, $36 million and $31 million, respectively.         

(a)  
  As of December 31, 2015, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $13 million of cash and $69 million of letters of credit.
             ComEd s power procurement contracts
provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The

benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the
benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents
ComEd s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd s net credit exposure to suppliers was immaterial.         
  ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is
mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.         
  PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s
performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit
rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy.
To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit
used by the suppliers represents PECO s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2015, PECO had no net credit exposure to suppliers.         
  PECO is permitted to recover its costs of procuring electric supply through its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. PECO s counterparty credit risk is
mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.         
  PECO s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved annually on a prospective basis by the PAPUC. PECO s counterparty credit risk
under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the PGC, which allows PECO to adjust rates quarterly to reflect realized natural gas prices. PECO does not obtain
collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements. As of December 31, 2015, PECO s credit exposure under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers was
immaterial.            BGE is permitted to recover its costs of
procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved procurement tariffs. BGE s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.
           BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power
agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured
credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based
on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price,
the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents BGE s net credit exposure. The seller s credit
exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2015, BGE had no net credit exposure to suppliers.

   BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This market-price risk is
mitigated by BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make off-system sales after BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are not covered by the gas
cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, BGE had credit exposure of $4 million related to off-system sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or right to offset clauses within other contracts with those
third-party suppliers.              Collateral and
Contingent-Related Features (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, fuels, emissions allowances and other
energy-related products. Certain of Generation s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on exchanges (i.e. NYMEX, ICE). The exchanges act as the
counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation s
credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or
lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets
with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a
function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best
estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.         
  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully
collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:         

(a)  
  Amount represents the gross fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk-related contingent features ignoring the effects of master netting
agreements.     

(b)  
  Amount represents the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with the same counterparty, which reduces the
amount of any liability for which a Registrant could potentially be required to post collateral.     

(c)  
  Amount represents the net fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features after considering the mitigating effects of
offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be based.

   Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,267 million and letters of credit posted of $497
million, and cash collateral held of $21 million and letters of credit held of $78 million as of December 31, 2015 for external counterparties with derivative positions. Generation had cash collateral posted of $1,497 million and letters of
credit posted of $672 million and cash collateral held of $77 million and letters of credit held of $24 million at December 31, 2014 for external counterparties with derivative positions. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment
grade (i.e. to BB+ by S P or Ba1 by Moody s), Generation would have been required to post additional collateral of $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts represent the potential
additional collateral required after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.         
  Generation s and Exelon s interest rate swaps contain provisions that, in the event of a merger, if Generation s debt ratings were to
materially weaken, it would be in violation of these provisions, resulting in the ability of the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to maturity. Collateralization would not be required under any circumstance. Termination of the agreement
could result in a settlement payment by Exelon or the counterparty on any interest rate swap in a net liability position. The settlement amount would be equal to the fair value of the swap on the termination date. As of December 31, 2015,
Generation s and Exelon s swaps were in an asset position, with a fair value of $13 million and $38 million, respectively.         
  See Note 25 Segment Information for further information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.   
        Generation entered into supply forward contracts with certain
utilities, including PECO and BGE, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices
rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded. Under the terms of ComEd s standard block energy contracts, collateral
postings are one-sided from suppliers, including Generation, should exposures between market prices and benchmark prices exceed established unsecured credit limits outlined in the contracts. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd held no collateral
from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts. Under the terms of ComEd s annual renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required to cover a fixed value for RECs only. In addition, under the terms of ComEd s
long-term renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required from suppliers for both RECs and energy. The REC portion is a fixed value and the energy portion is one-sided from suppliers should the forward market prices exceed contract
prices. As of December 31, 2015, ComEd held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit as margin for both the annual and long-term REC obligations. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.
           PECO s natural gas procurement contracts contain
provisions that could require PECO to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon PECO s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit
support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2015, PECO was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2015, PECO could
have been required to post approximately $25 million of collateral to its counterparties.            PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP Program contracts do not contain provisions that would require PECO to post collateral.

   BGE s full requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of its electric
supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require BGE to post collateral.            BGE s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require BGE to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon
BGE s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2015, BGE was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements.
If BGE lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2015, BGE could have been required to post approximately $35 million of collateral to its counterparties.   
           14. Debt and Credit Agreements (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)               Short-Term Borrowings     
        Exelon, ComEd and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements
primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool.   
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE had the following amounts of
commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014:         

(a)  
  Reflects aggregate bank commitments under the revolving and bilateral credit agreements (with the exception of $275 million and $200 million bilateral agreements for Generation
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) that backstop the commercial paper program. See discussion and Credit Facilities table below for items affecting effective program size.     

(b)  
  Excludes additional credit facilities for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million and $5 million, respectively,
arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s service territories. The agreements for these facilities expired on October 16, 2015 and were renewed at the same amount through
October 14, 2016. These facilities are solely utilized to issue letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit issued under these facilities totaled $7 million, $14 million, $21 million and $2 million for Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE, respectively.              In order to
maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each Registrant must have revolving credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. While the amount of outstanding
commercial paper does not reduce available capacity under a Registrant s credit facility, a Registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its credit facility.

   At December 31, 2015, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit
facility borrowings and available capacity under their respective credit facilities:         

(a)  
  Excludes additional credit facilities for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million and $5 million, respectively,
arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s service territories. The agreements for these facilities expired on October 16, 2015 and were renewed at the same amount through
October 14, 2016. These facilities are solely utilized to issue letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015, letters of credit issued under these facilities totaled $7 million, $14 million, $21 million and $2 million for Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE, respectively.     

(b)  
  Excludes $275 million bilateral credit facilities that do not back Generation s commercial paper program.     

(c)  
  Excludes nonrecourse debt letters of credit, see discussion below on Continental Wind.     
        As of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings under the
Registrants  credit facilities.            The following tables
present the short-term borrowings activity for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and BGE during 2015, 2014 and 2013. PECO did not have any short-term borrowings during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

            Credit Agreements     
        On October 23, 2015, the credit agreement for CENG s $100
million bilateral credit facility was amended and extended for an additional two years. This facility has been utilized by CENG to fund working capital and capital projects. This facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.
           On January 5, 2016, Generation entered into a credit
agreement establishing a $150 million bilateral credit facility, scheduled to mature in January of 2019. This facility does not back Generation s commercial paper program.   
        Borrowings under Exelon Corporate s, Generation s,
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s revolving credit facilities bear interest at a rate based upon either the prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate, plus an adder based upon the particular registrant s credit rating. Exelon Corporate,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have adders of 27.5, 27.5, 7.5, 0.0 and 0.0 basis points for prime based borrowings and 127.5, 127.5, 107.5, 90.0 and 100.0 basis points for LIBOR-based borrowings. The maximum adders for prime rate borrowings and
LIBOR-based rate borrowings are 65 basis points and 165 basis points, respectively. The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit
ratings of the borrower.            An event of default under any of
the Registrants  credit agreements would not constitute an event of default under any of the other Registrants  credit agreements, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in
principal amount in excess of $100 million in the aggregate by Generation under its credit agreement would constitute an event of default under the Exelon Corporation credit agreement.

   Each credit agreement requires the affected borrower to maintain a minimum cash from operations to
interest expense ratio for the twelve-month period ended on the last day of any quarter. The ratios exclude revenues and interest expenses attributable to securitization debt, certain changes in working capital, distributions on preferred securities
of subsidiaries and, in the case of Exelon and Generation, interest on the debt of its project subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the minimum thresholds reflected in the credit agreements for the year ended December 31, 2015:
        
          At December 31, 2015, the interest
coverage ratios at the Registrants were as follows:

    PHI Merger Financing           
  In May 2014, concurrently and in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire PHI, Exelon entered into a credit facility to which the
lenders committed to provide Exelon a 364-day senior unsecured bridge credit facility of $7.2 billion to support the contemplated transaction and provide flexibility for timing of permanent financing. In June 2015, the remaining $3.2 billion bridge
credit facility was terminated as a result of Exelon s issuance of $4.2 billion of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price and related costs and expenses for the pending PHI merger and for general corporate purposes.   
        In connection with the $4.2 billion issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes
in 2015, the tranches due in 2025, 2035, and 2045 had to be redeemed at the principal amount plus a 1% premium of principal on December 31, 2015, if the PHI merger was not consummated or terminated prior to such date ( Special Mandatory
Redemption ). Exelon also had the option to redeem those notes earlier at a 1% premium of principal, if Exelon determined that the merger would not be completed before December 31, 2015.   
        On October 29, 2015, Exelon commenced a private exchange offer
(Exchange Offer) to certain eligible holders whereby, for those that took part, the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes in the 2025, 2035 and 2045 tranches were exchanged for new Senior Unsecured Notes. The new Senior Unsecured Notes have
substantially the same terms as the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, except the outside date with regard to the special redemption provisions is June 30, 2016, (or the date the PHI merger is terminated if earlier), rather than
December 31, 2015, and under certain circumstances, can be further extended to August 31, 2016.         
  On December 2, 2015, Exelon exchanged $1.9 billion of the Senior Unsecured Notes and paid a consent fee of approximately $5 million, which has
been deferred on Exelon s Consolidated Balance

in the form of 23 million equity units at a stated amount of $50.00 per unit. Net proceeds from the issuance were $1.11 billion, net of a $35 million underwriter fee. The net proceeds are expected to be used to finance a portion of the merger
and related costs and expenses for the pending PHI merger and for general corporate purposes. Each equity unit represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in Exelon s 2.50% junior subordinated notes due in 2024 and a forward equity
purchase contract which settles in 2017. The junior subordinated notes are expected to be remarketed in 2017.         
  At the time of issuance, Exelon determined that the forward equity purchase contract had no value and therefore the entire $1.15 billion of junior
subordinated notes were allocated to debt and recorded within Long-term debt on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, at the time of issuance, the present value of the contract payments of $131 million ( Contract Payment
Obligation ) were recorded to Long-term debt, representing the obligation to make contract payments, with an offsetting reduction to Common stock. The obligation for the contract payments is accreted to interest expense over the 3 year period
ending in 2017 in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. During 2015, contract payments of $44 million related to the Contract Payment Obligation were included within Retirements of long-term debt in
Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During 2014, the Contract Payment Obligation was considered a non-cash financing transaction that was excluded from Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Until settlement of the
equity purchase contract, earnings per share dilution resulting from the equity unit issuance will be determined under the treasury stock method.         
    Nonrecourse Debt           
  Exelon and Generation have issued nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately $2.4 billion of generating assets and $0.2 billion of Upstream
gas properties have been pledged as collateral at December 31, 2015. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event
of a default.              Denver
Airport.      In June 2011, Generation entered into a 20-year, $7 million solar loan agreement to finance a solar construction project in Denver, Colorado. The agreement is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2031. The
agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% annually with interest payable annually. As of December 31, 2015, $7 million was outstanding.        
          CEU Upstream.      In July 2011,
Generation entered into a 5-year asset-based lending agreement associated with certain Upstream gas properties that it owns. The borrowing base committed under the facility is $85 million as of December 31, 2015. The commitment level can be
decreased if the assets no longer support the current borrowing base, which would result in repayment of a portion or all of the outstanding balance. The commitment can be increased up to $500 million if the assets support a

higher borrowing base and Generation is able to obtain additional commitments from lenders. Calculations of the borrowing base are impacted by projected production and commodity prices. The
facility was amended and extended through January 2019. The agreement bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% and is payable monthly. As of December 31, 2015, $68 million was outstanding under the facility.   
          Sacramento PV Energy.      In July
2011, a subsidiary of Generation entered into a 19-year, $41 million nonrecourse note to finance a 30MW solar facility in Sacramento, California. The note is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2030. The note bears interest at a variable rate
equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% and is payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, $33 million was outstanding. The subsidiary also executed interest rate swaps with an initial notional value of $30 million at an interest rate of 3.57% in order to
convert the variable interest payments to fixed payments on 75% of the $41 million facility amount, as required by the debt covenants. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps.  
               Holyoke Solar
Cooperative.      In October 2011, Generation entered into a 20-year, $11 million solar loan agreement related to a solar construction project in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The agreement is scheduled to mature on December
2031. The agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% annually with interest payable monthly. As of December 31, 2015, $10 million was outstanding.        
          Antelope Valley Solar Ranch
One.      In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley
facility. The project became fully operational in the first half of 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable
maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of 2.82%. As of December 31, 2015, $574 million was outstanding. In addition, Generation
has issued letters of credit to support its equity investment in the project. As of December 31, 2015, Generation had $69 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.        
          Constellation Solar Horizons.      In
September 2012, a subsidiary of Generation entered into an 18-year $38 million nonrecourse note to recover capital used to build a 16MW solar facility in Emmitsburg, Maryland. The note is scheduled to mature on September 7, 2030. The note bears
interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% with interest payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, $32 million was outstanding. The subsidiary also executed interest rate swaps for an initial notional amount of $29 million at an
interest rate of 2.03% in order to convert the variable interest payments to fixed payments on 75% of the $38 million facility amount, as required by the debt covenants. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information
regarding interest rate swaps.             
    Continental Wind.      In September 2013, Continental Wind, LLC (Continental Wind), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon
and Generation, completed the issuance and sale of $613 million senior secured notes. Continental Wind owns and operates a portfolio of wind farms in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas with a total net capacity of 667MW. The net
proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes. The notes are scheduled to mature on February 28, 2033. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.00% with interest payable semi-annually. As of December 31,
2015, $572 million was outstanding.                 In
addition, Continental Wind entered into a $131 million letter of credit facility and $10 million working capital revolver facility. Continental Wind has issued letters of credit to satisfy certain of its credit support and security obligations. As
of December 31, 2015, the Continental Wind letter of credit facility had $99 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.

     ExGen Renewables I.      In February 2014, ExGen Renewables I, LLC
(EGR), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, borrowed $300 million aggregate principal amount pursuant to a nonrecourse senior secured loan. The proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes. The loan is
scheduled to mature on February 6, 2021. The loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.25%, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor with interest payable quarterly. EGR indirectly owns Continental Wind. As of December 31, 2015, $258
million was outstanding. In addition to the financing, EGR entered into interest rate swaps with an initial notional amount of $240 million at an interest rate of 2.03% to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure in connection with the
financing. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps.             
    ExGen Texas Power.      In September 2014, ExGen Texas Power, LLC (EGTP), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and
Generation, issued $675 million aggregate principal amount of a nonrecourse senior secured term loan. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for general business purposes. The loan is scheduled to mature on September 18, 2021. The term
loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.75%, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor with interest payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2015, $666 million was outstanding. As part of the agreement, a revolving credit facility was
established for the amount of $20 million available through, and scheduled to mature on September 18, 2019. In addition to the financing, EGTP entered into interest rate swaps with an initial notional amount of approximately $505 million at an
interest rate of 2.34% to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure in connection with this financing, as required by the debt covenants. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate
swaps.                   15. Income Taxes

Included in Exelon s unrecognized
tax benefits balance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are approximately $540 million and $1,129 million, respectively, of tax positions for which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
such benefits. The disallowance of such positions would not materially affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to, or defer the receipt of the cash tax benefit from, the taxing authority to an earlier or later
period respectively.             Nuclear Decommissioning Liabilities
(Exelon and Generation)             AmerGen filed income tax
refund claims taking the position that nuclear decommissioning liabilities assumed as part of its acquisition of nuclear power plants are taken into account in determining the tax basis in the assets it acquired. The additional basis results
primarily in reduced capital gains or increased capital losses on the sale of assets in nonqualified decommissioning funds and increased tax depreciation and amortization deductions. The IRS disagrees with this position and disallowed AmerGen s
claims. In early 2009, Generation filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims to contest this determination. On September 17, 2013, the Court granted the government s motion denying AmerGen s claims for refund. In
the first quarter of 2014, Exelon filed an appeal of the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 11, 2015, the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court s decision to deny AmerGen s claims for
refund. Exelon will not be pursuing further appeals with respect to this issue and, as a result, reduced Generation and PECO s unrecognized tax benefits by a total of $661 million and $43 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015.
This change in unrecognized tax benefits had no impact on Exelon, Generation, or PECO s effective tax rate.         
    Unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate     
        Exelon and Generation have $538 million and $509 million,
respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. BGE has

$120 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 that, if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.
Exelon and Generation had $701 million and $672 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. In 2015, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased at Exelon and
Generation due to settlements with state tax authorities and the expiration of statues of limitations for certain state jurisdictions.         
    Reasonably possible that total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within 12 months after the
reporting date               Like-Kind Exchange
            As of December 31, 2015, Exelon and ComEd have
approximately $397 million and $142 million of unrecognized tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date as a result of a decision in the like-kind exchange litigation described below. Exelon and ComEd
have unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease Exelon s effective tax rate by $69 million and increase ComEd s effective tax rate by $11 million.   
         Settlement of Income Tax Audits and Litigation    
        As of December 31, 2015, Exelon, Generation, and BGE have
approximately $174 million, $54 million, and $120 million of unrecognized state tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date as a result of completing audits, potential settlements, and expected
statute of limitation expirations. Of the above unrecognized tax benefits, Exelon and Generation have $54 million that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefit related to BGE, if recognized, may be included
in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.              Total amounts of interest and penalties recognized

     Description of tax years that remain open to assessment by major jurisdiction
          
           Other Tax Matters    
          Like-Kind Exchange     
        Exelon, through its ComEd subsidiary, took a position on its 1999
income tax return to defer approximately $1.2 billion of tax gain on the sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. The gain was deferred by reinvesting a portion of the proceeds from the sale in qualifying replacement property under the
like-kind exchange provisions of the IRC. The like-kind exchange replacement property purchased by Exelon included interests in three municipal-owned electric generation facilities which were properly leased back to the municipalities. The IRS
disagreed with this position and asserted that the entire gain of approximately $1.2 billion was taxable in 1999.         
  Exelon has been unable to reach agreement with the IRS regarding the dispute over the like-kind exchange position. The IRS has asserted that
Exelon s purchase and leaseback transaction is substantially similar to a leasing transaction, known as a SILO, which the IRS does not respect as the acquisition of an ownership interest in property. A SILO is a  listed transaction 
that the IRS has identified as a potentially abusive tax shelter under guidance issued in 2005. Accordingly, the IRS has asserted that the sale of the fossil plants followed by the purchase and leaseback of the municipal owned generation facilities
does not qualify as a like-kind exchange and the gain on the sale is fully subject to tax. The IRS has also asserted a penalty of approximately $90 million for a substantial understatement of tax.   
        Exelon disagrees with the IRS and continues to believe that its
like-kind exchange transaction is not the same as or substantially similar to a SILO. Although Exelon has been and remains willing to settle the disagreement on terms commensurate with the hazards of litigation, Exelon does not believe a settlement
is possible. Because Exelon believed, as of December 31, 2012, that it was more-likely-than-not that Exelon would prevail in litigation, Exelon and ComEd had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits with respect to the like-kind exchange
position.            On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and reached a decision for the government in Consolidated Edison v. United States. The Court disallowed Consolidated Edison s deductions stemming from its participation
in a LILO transaction that the IRS also has characterized as a tax shelter.            In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Exelon is required to assess whether it is more-likely-than-not that it will prevail in litigation. Exelon continues to believe that its transaction is not a SILO
and that it has a strong case on the merits. However, in light of the Consolidated Edison decision and Exelon s current determination that settlement is unlikely, Exelon has concluded that
  
         354

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
subsequent to December 31, 2012, it is no longer more-likely-than-not that its position will be sustained. As a result, in the first quarter of 2013, Exelon recorded a non-cash charge to
earnings of approximately $265 million, which represents the amount of interest expense (after-tax) and incremental state income tax expense for periods through March 31, 2013 that would be payable in the event that Exelon is unsuccessful in
litigation. Of this amount, approximately $172 million was recorded at ComEd. Exelon intends to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of the after-tax interest amounts on ComEd s equity. As such, ComEd recorded on its consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, a $172 million receivable and non-cash equity contributions from Exelon. Exelon and ComEd will continue to accrue interest on the unpaid tax liabilities related to the uncertain tax position, and the charges
arising from future interest accruals are not expected to be material to the annual operating earnings of Exelon or ComEd. In addition, ComEd will continue to record non-cash equity contributions from Exelon in the amount of the net after-tax
interest charges attributable to ComEd in connection with the like-kind exchange position. Exelon continues to believe that it is unlikely that the IRS s assertion of penalties will ultimately be sustained and therefore no liability for the
penalty has been recorded.            On September 30, 2013, the
IRS issued a notice of deficiency to Exelon for the like-kind exchange position. Exelon filed a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the United States Tax Court and the trial took place in August of 2015. Exelon was not
required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the issue. While the Tax Court could reach its decision as early as 2016, the litigation could take three to five years if an appeal is necessary. Decisions in the Tax
Court are not controlled by the Federal Circuit s decision in Consolidated Edison.            In the first quarter of 2014, Exelon entered into an agreement to terminate its investment in one of the three municipal-owned electric generation properties in exchange for a net early termination amount of $335
million. In connection with the termination, Exelon deposited $65 million with the IRS, including $35 million by ComEd. The deposit can be redesignated to any tax year, if necessary, and may be used to satisfy any amounts owed as a result of the
litigation.            In the event of a fully successful IRS
challenge to Exelon s like-kind exchange position, the potential tax and after-tax interest, net of the deposit discussed above and exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable as of December 31, 2015 may be as much as $760
million, of which approximately $280 million would be attributable to ComEd after consideration of Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless. Interest will continue to accrue until such time as payment is made. An appeal of an adverse decision
in the Tax Court would necessitate either the posting of a bond or the payment of the tax and interest for the tax years before the court. A final appellate decision could take several years.              Accounting for Generation Repairs (Exelon and Generation)     
        On April 30, 2013, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2013-24
providing guidance for determining the appropriate tax treatment of costs incurred to repair electric generation assets. Generation changed its method of accounting for deducting repairs in accordance with this guidance beginning in the 2014 tax
year. The adoption of the new method resulted in Generation recording a cash tax detriment of approximately $120 million in 2014.         
    Long-Term State Tax Apportionment (Exelon and Generation)     
        The long-term state tax apportionment was revised in the fourth
quarter of 2015 pursuant to Exelon s long-term state tax apportionment policy, resulting in the recording of a deferred state tax   
         355

expense for Exelon and Generation of $41 million (net of Federal taxes) and $11 million (net of Federal taxes), respectively. In 2014, in accordance with the policy, Exelon and Generation
recorded a deferred state tax benefit of $28 million (net of Federal taxes) and $40 million (net of Federal taxes), respectively. The amounts recorded for 2013 in accordance with the policy were immaterial.   
          Allocation of Tax Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)              Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are all party
to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax
similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net benefit attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party
receiving the benefit. During 2015, Generation, PECO, and BGE recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $57 million, $16 million, and $7 million respectively. ComEd did not record an allocation of
Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.         
  During 2014, Generation and PECO recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $55 million and $25
million, respectively. ComEd and BGE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of tax net operating losses.   
        During 2013, Generation and PECO recorded an allocation of Federal tax
benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $26 million and $27 million, respectively. During 2013, ComEd and BGE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of
ComEd s and BGE s tax net operating loss generated primarily by the bonus depreciation deduction allowed under the Tax Relief Act of 2010.         
     16. Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations
             Generation has a legal obligation to decommission
its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a
probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates,
probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Generation generally updates its ARO annually during the third quarter, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of
cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015:         

(a)  
  Represents the fair value of the CENG ARO liability as of April 1, 2014, the date of consolidation. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for
additional information.     

(b)  
  Includes $7 million and $8 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.              During 2015, Generation s total nuclear ARO increased by approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting impacts of ARO updates completed during 2015 to reflect changes in amounts and timing of estimated
decommissioning cash flows and impacts of year-to-date accretion of the ARO liability due to the passage of time.         
  The increase in the ARO during 2015 was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $630 million for costs expected to be incurred for required
site security during the decommissioning periods in which SNF remains on-site and until major reactor components and buildings have been dismantled and removed. This projected increase is based on emerging industry experience at nuclear sites in the
planning or early stage of decommissioning indicating greater than originally expected numbers of security personnel required to be on site during these decommissioning periods. Generation will continue to monitor emerging security cost trends,
including potential strategies to limit such costs by, for example, optimizing the transfer of SNF when DOE starts taking possession of SNF or increasing the use of dry SNF storage, and will adjust the ARO liability accordingly. The 2015 increase in
the ARO includes an increase of approximately $285 million for the impacts of a change implemented in the 2015 annual assessment of Generation s SNF storage and disposal cost estimation methodology to better align the projected timing of SNF
transfers to the DOE with assumed plant shutdown dates as well as higher assumed probabilities of early retirements of certain economically challenged nuclear plants (See Note 9 Implications of Potential Early Plant Retirements for additional
information) and further accretion of the obligation. These increases were partially offset by reductions in estimated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor and energy costs.   
        The financial statement impact related to the increase in the ARO due
to the changes in, and timing of, estimated cash flows primarily resulted in a corresponding increase in Property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Approximately $8 million of the 2015
adjustment resulted in a credit to income, which is included in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

   During 2014, Generation s ARO increased by approximately $2.1 billion. The increase is
largely driven by the recording of an ARO on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, including subsequent purchase accounting adjustments, upon consolidation of CENG (see Note 5 Investment in Constellation
Energy Nuclear Group, LLC ). The change in the ARO was also driven by an increase for accretion of the obligation and an increase in the estimated costs to decommission Byron, Braidwood, and LaSalle nuclear units resulting from the completion of
updated decommissioning costs studies received during 2014 as part of the annual assessment. These increases in the ARO were partially offset by decreases in the ARO due to a reduction in estimated escalation rates, primarily for labor and energy
costs. The increase in the ARO due to the changes in, and timing of, estimated cash flows was offset within Property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, aside from an approximate $16 million
credit to income, which is included in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
          Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments     
        NDT funds have been established for each generating station unit to
satisfy Generation s nuclear decommissioning obligations. Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.            The NDT funds associated with Generation s nuclear units have been funded with amounts collected from the previous
owners and their respective utility customers. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of the
former PECO plants. The amounts collected from PECO customers are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects
PECO s calculations of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs. The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO
customers. The most recent rate adjustment occurred on January 1, 2013, and the effective rates currently yield annual collections of approximately $24 million. The next five-year adjustment is expected to be reflected in rates charged to PECO
customers effective January 1, 2018. Aside from the former PECO units, Generation does not currently collect any amounts, nor is there any mechanism by which Generation can seek to collect additional amounts, from utility customers. Apart from
the contributions made to the NDT funds from amounts previously collected from ComEd and currently collected from PECO customers, Generation has not made contributions to the NDT funds.            Any shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required
to be funded by Generation, with the exception of a shortfall for the current decommissioning activities at Zion Station, where certain decommissioning activities have been transferred to a third-party (see Zion Station Decommissioning below) and
the CENG units, where any shortfall is required to be funded by both Generation and EDF. Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers related to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject
to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC. Generally, PECO, and likewise Generation will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first $50 million of any shortfall of trust funds compared to
decommissioning costs, as well as 5% of any additional shortfalls, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units. The initial $50 million and up to 5% of any additional shortfalls would be borne by Generation. No recourse exists to collect
additional amounts from utility customers for any of Generation s other nuclear units. With respect to

the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd s or PECO s customers, subject to
certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO units. With respect to Generation s other nuclear units, Generation retains any funds remaining after decommissioning. However, in connection with
CENG s acquisition of the Nine Mile Point and Ginna plants and settlements with certain regulatory agencies, CENG is subject to certain conditions pertaining to nuclear decommissioning trust funds that, if met, could possibly result in
obligations to make payments to certain third parties (clawbacks). For Nine Mile Point and Ginna, the clawback provisions are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activities are discontinued or not started or completed in a
timely manner. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Nine Mile Point, then, depending upon the triggering event, an amount equal to 50% of the total amount withdrawn from the funds for non-decommissioning activities or 50% of
any excess funds in the trust funds above the amounts required for decommissioning (including spent fuel management and decommissioning) is to be paid to the Nine Mile Point sellers. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Ginna,
then an amount equal to any estimated cost savings realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activities is to be paid to the Ginna sellers. Generation expects to comply with applicable regulations and timely commence and
complete all required decommissioning activities.            At
December 31, 2015, and 2014, Exelon and Generation had NDT fund investments totaling $10,342 million and $10,537 million, respectively. For additional information related to the NDT fund investments, refer to Note 12 Fair Value of
Financial Assets and Liabilities.            The following table
provides unrealized gains on NDT funds for 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  Net unrealized gains (losses) related to Generation s NDT funds associated with Regulatory Agreement Units are included in Regulatory liabilities on Exelon s
Consolidated Balance Sheets and Noncurrent payables to affiliates on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(b)  
  Excludes $7 million, $29 million and $7 million of net unrealized gains related to the Zion Station pledged assets in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net unrealized gains
related to Zion Station pledged assets are included in the Payable for Zion Station decommissioning on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis, as long as funds held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed the total estimated
decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to
affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability. Should the expected value of the NDT
fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that
unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the adverse impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and
financial position could be material. As of December 31, 2015, the NDT funds of each of the former ComEd units, except for Zion (see Zion Station Decommissioning below), are expected to exceed the related decommissioning obligation for each of
the units. For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is different, as described below, from the calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines. 
            Based on the regulatory agreement supported by the
PAPUC that dictates Generation s rights and obligations related to the shortfall or excess of trust funds necessary for decommissioning the former PECO units, regardless of whether the funds held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed or fall
short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at
Exelon. Likewise, PECO has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and a corresponding regulatory liability. Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon s and Generation s ability to offset
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material.   
        The decommissioning-related activities related to the Non-Regulatory
Agreement Units are reflected in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.         
  Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 26 Related Party Transactions for information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and
PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund to customers any decommissioning-related assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.   
          Zion Station Decommissioning     
        On September 1, 2010, Generation completed an Asset Sale
Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion
  
         360

Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with
Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF and decommission the
SNF dry storage facility, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to its decommissioning efforts at Zion Station.
During 2013, EnergySolutions entered a definitive acquisition agreement and was acquired by another Company. Generation reviewed the acquisition as it relates to the ASA to decommission Zion Station. Based on that review, Generation determined that
the acquisition will not adversely impact decommissioning activities under the ASA.            ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursements from the Zion Station NDT funds as defined within the ASA. Therefore, the transfer of the Zion Station assets did not
qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and, as a result, the related NDT funds were reclassified to Pledged assets for Zion Station decommissioning within Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be
measured in the same manner as prior to the completion of the transaction. Additionally, the transferred ARO for decommissioning was replaced with a Payable for Zion Station decommissioning in Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Changes in the value of the Zion Station NDT assets, net of applicable taxes, will be recorded as a change in the Payable to ZionSolutions. At no point will the payable to ZionSolutions exceed the project budget of the costs remaining to
decommission Zion Station. Generation has retained its obligation for the SNF. Following ZionSolutions  completion of its contractual obligations and transfer of the NRC license to Generation, Generation will store the SNF at Zion Station until
it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and will complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility. Generation has a liability of approximately $84 million, which is included within the
nuclear decommissioning ARO at December 31, 2015. Generation also has retained NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain the SNF at Zion Station until transfer to the DOE and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF
storage facility. Any shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. Any Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning
activities will be returned to ComEd customers in accordance with the applicable orders. The following table provides the pledged assets and payables to ZionSolutions, and withdrawals by ZionSolutions at December 31, 2015 and 2014:   

(a)  
  Excludes a liability recorded within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the tax obligation on the unrealized activity associated with the
Zion Station NDT Funds. The NDT Funds will be utilized to satisfy the tax obligations as gains and losses are realized.     

(b)  
  Included in Other current liabilities within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(c)  
  Includes project expenses to decommission Zion Station and estimated tax payments on Zion Station NDT fund earnings.     
        ZionSolutions leased the land associated with Zion Station from
Generation pursuant to a Lease Agreement. Under the Lease Agreement, ZionSolutions has committed to complete the required   
         361

decommissioning work according to an established schedule and constructed a dry cask storage facility on the land and has loaded the SNF from the SNF pools onto the dry cask storage facility at
Zion Station. Rent payable under the Lease Agreement is $1.00 per year, although the Lease Agreement requires ZionSolutions to pay property taxes associated with Zion Station and penalty rents may accrue if there are unexcused delays in the progress
of decommissioning work at Zion Station or the construction of the dry cask SNF storage facility. To reduce the risk of default by ZionSolutions, EnergySolutions provided a $200 million letter of credit to be used to fund decommissioning costs in
the event the NDT assets are insufficient. EnergySolutions and its parent company have also provided a performance guarantee and EnergySolutions has entered into other agreements that will provide rights and remedies for Generation and the NRC in
the case of other specified events of default, including a special purpose easement for disposal capacity at the EnergySolutions site in Clive, Utah, for all LLRW volume of Zion Station.              NRC Minimum Funding Requirements           
  NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified
minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as calculated using the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded on Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets
primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs, and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and
the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires
either further funding or other financial guarantees.            Key
assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2015 include: (1) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit; (2) the option on a unit-by-unit
basis to use generic, non-site specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed license renewals for
those units that have not already received renewals and with an assumed end-of-operations date of 2019 for Oyster Creek); (5) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of
decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual after-tax returns on the NDT funds of 2% (3% for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).   
        In contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to
determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at December 31, 2015 include: (1) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of
all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units, on-site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance,
and disposal of certain low-level radioactive waste); (3) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning activities are completed under three possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations;
(4) the assumption plants cease operating at the end of an extended license life (assuming 20-year license renewal extensions, except Oyster Creek with an assumed end-of-operations date of 2019); (5) the measurement of the obligation at
the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately 5% through a period of approximately 30 years after the end of the extended lives of the units; and (6) an estimated targeted annual
pre-tax return on the NDT funds of 6.1% to 6.3% (as compared to a historical 5-year annual average pre-tax return of approximately 7%).

   Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that
have been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds,
Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are
adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Exelon s and Generation s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected.            On March 31, 2014, Generation submitted its NRC required annual decommissioning funding report as of
December 31, 2013 for reactors that have been shut down except for Zion Station which is included on a separate report to the NRC submitted by EnergySolutions (see Zion Station Decommissioning above). This submittal also included the required
updated financial tests for the Limerick Unit 1 parent guarantee that had been established in 2013. There was no change to the amount of the parent guarantee, or the funding status of these reactors. Adequate decommissioning funding assurance was in
place for all reactors owned by Generation. During 2014, the operating license for Limerick Unit 1 was extended by 20 years. As a result of this extension, and the subsequent funding assurance calculation performed by the NRC, it was found that the
parent company guarantee was no longer required and thus the parent guarantee for Limerick Unit 1 has been cancelled effective March 13, 2015. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the operating license
extension for Limerick Unit 1.            Generation filed its
biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on March 31, 2015. This report reflects the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2014. Due to increased cost estimates received in the second half of
2014, Braidwood Unit 1, Braidwood Unit 2, and Byron Unit 2 did not meet the NRC s minimum funding assurance criteria as of December 31, 2014. NRC guidance provides licensees with two years or by the time of submitting the next biennial
report (on or before March 31, 2017) to resolve funding assurance shortfalls. During this period, Generation will monitor funding assurance and new developments, including the impact of a 20-year license renewal for Braidwood and Byron, to
assess the status of funding assurance and to take steps, if necessary, to address any funding shortfall on these funds on or before March 31, 2017. On February 4, 2016, Generation submitted an updated decommissioning funding status report
with the NRC for Braidwood Units 1 and 2, and Byron Unit 2. This report reflected the recently approved license renewals for these units, and showed that they have adequate decommissioning funding assurance, and that the shortfall identified in the
March 31, 2015 report has now been resolved. The increased security costs discussed above will be taken into consideration, as appropriate and in accordance with the regulatory requirements, in Generation s future decommissioning funding
status reports submitted to the NRC. Generation does not expect the increased costs to change Generation s NRC minimum funding assurance status.         
  As the future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation s units will change. In
addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO units, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at
subsequent NRC filing dates.             Non-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Generation
has AROs for plant closure costs associated with its fossil and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the

condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations and other decommissioning-related activities. ComEd, PECO and BGE have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and
disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Registrants  accounting policy for AROs.   
        The following table provides a rollforward of the non-nuclear AROs
reflected on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015:         

(a)  
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, Generation recorded a decrease of $(2) million in Operating and maintenance expense. ComEd, PECO, and BGE did not record any
adjustments in Operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Generation recorded a decrease of $(2) million and ComEd recorded an increase of $1 million in Operating and
maintenance expense. PECO and BGE did not record any adjustments in Operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2014.     

(b)  
  Relates to new AROs recorded due to the construction of solar, wind and other non-nuclear generating sites.     

(c)  
  For ComEd, PECO, and BGE, the majority of the accretion is recorded as an increase to a regulatory asset due to the associated regulatory treatment.     

(d)  
  Represents AROs related to generating stations classified as held for sale. See Note 4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for further information.

(e)  
  Reflects a reduction to the ARO resulting primarily from the sales of Schuylkill generating station in 2015 and Keystone and Conemaugh generating stations in 2014. See Note
4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for further information.     

(f)  
  Excludes $5 million, $2 million, $0 million and $1 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2015 for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. Excludes
$1 million, $1 million, $1 million and $1 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2014 for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. This is included in Other current liabilities on the Registrants  respective

   Exelon s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended to be tax-qualified defined
benefit plans. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented
employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated under the IRC as qualified trusts. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts,
subject to certain IRC limitations.              Benefit Obligations, Plan Assets
and Funded Status              Exelon recognizes the overfunded
or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to Accumulated OCI and regulatory assets (liabilities), in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance.
The measurement date for the plans is December 31.         
  During the first quarter of 2015, Exelon received an updated valuation of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to reflect actual
census data as of January 1, 2015. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $45 million and an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation of $57 million. Additionally, Accumulated other comprehensive loss
(AOCL) increased by approximately $27 million (after tax), regulatory assets increased by approximately $48 million, and regulatory liabilities decreased by approximately $11 million.            The following table provides a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the most recent
two years for all plans combined:

  On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, Exelon became a sponsor of CENG s pension and OPEB plans effective
July 14, 2014. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for further information.           
  Exelon presents its benefit obligations and plan assets net on its balance sheet within the following line items:   
     
          The funded status of the pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations refers to the difference between plan assets and estimated obligations of the plan. The funded status changes over time due to several factors, including contribution levels, assumed discount rates and actual
returns on plan assets.            The following tables provide the
projected benefit obligations (PBO), accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with a PBO or ABO in excess of plan assets.   

On a PBO basis, the plans were funded
at 81% at December 31, 2015 compared to 81% at December 31, 2014. On an ABO basis, the plans were funded at 85% at December 31, 2015 compared to 87% at December 31, 2014. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO includes no
assumption about future compensation levels.

     Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs              The majority of the 2015 pension benefit cost for Exelon-sponsored plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 3.94%. The majority of the 2015 other postretirement benefit cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.46% for funded plans and a discount rate of
3.92%. A portion of the net periodic benefit cost for all pension and OPEB plans are capitalized within each of the Registrant s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table presents the components of Exelon s net periodic benefit
costs, prior to any capitalization, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.         
            Components of AOCI and Regulatory Assets
             Under the authoritative guidance for regulatory
accounting, a portion of current year actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized within Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be
recorded to AOCI. The following tables provide the components of AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 for all plans combined.         

(a)  
    Of the $110 million gain related to pension benefits, $64 million and $46 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2015. Of
the $123 million gain related to other postretirement benefits, $63 million and $60 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities), respectively, during 2015. Of the $1,203 million loss related to pension benefits, $788 million
and $415 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2014. Of the $379 million gain related to other postretirement benefits, $162 million and $217 million were recognized

in AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities), respectively, during 2014. Of the $1,753 million gain related to pension benefits, $1,071 million and $682 million were recognized in AOCI and
regulatory assets, respectively, during 2013. Of the $677 million gain related to other postretirement benefits, $352 million and $325 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2013.      
        The following table provides the components of Exelon s gross
accumulated other comprehensive loss and regulatory assets (liabilities) that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for all plans combined:   

The following table provides the components
of Exelon s AOCI and regulatory assets(liabilities) at December 31, 2015 (included in the table above) that are expected to be amortized as components of periodic benefit cost in 2016. These estimates are subject to the completion of an
actuarial valuation of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which will reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2016 and actual claims activity as of December 31, 2015. The valuation is expected to be
completed in the first quarter of 2016 for the majority of the benefit plans.         
     
            Assumptions     
        The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing
benefits under Exelon s defined benefit and other postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers
historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term EROA, Exelon s expected level
of contributions to the plans, the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees participating in cash balance plans and the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs. Additionally, assumptions related to plan participants include
the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age and length of service, among other factors.   
         369

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Expected Rate of Return.  In selecting the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic
indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon s target asset class allocations.     
         Mortality.  For the December 31, 2014 actuarial valuation,
Exelon changed its assumption of mortality to reflect more recent expectations of future improvements in life expectancy. The change was supported through completion of an experience study and supplemental analyses performed by its actuaries. The
change in assumption resulted in increases of $361 million and $117 million in the pension and other postretirement benefits obligations as of December 31, 2014, respectively. There were no changes to the mortality assumption in 2015.  
            The following assumptions were used to determine the
benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year s net periodic benefit costs.

   The following assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for all the plans
for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  The discount rates above represent the initial discount rates used to establish the majority of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefits costs for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Discount rates for CENG s legacy pension and OPEB plans ranged from 3.68%-4.14% and 4.32%-4.43%, respectively.     

(b)  
  The discount rates above represent the initial discount rates used to establish the majority of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefits costs for the year ended
December 31, 2014. Certain of the other postretirement benefit plans were remeasured as of April 30, 2014 using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.59% and a discount rate of 4.30%. Costs of the year ended
December 31, 2014 reflect the impact of this remeasurement. On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, Exelon became the sponsor of CENG s legacy pension and OPEB plans
effective July 14, 2014; discount rates for those plans, impacting 2014 costs, ranged from 3.60%-4.30% and 4.09%-4.55%, respectively. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for further information.

(c)  
  The discount rates above represent the initial discounts rates used to establish Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefits costs for the year ended
December 31, 2013. Certain of the benefit plans were remeasured during the year using discount rates of 4.21% and 4.66% for pension and other postretirement benefits, respectively. Costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect the
impact of these remeasurements.

            Health Care Reform Legislation
             In March 2010, the Health Care Reform Acts were
signed into law, which contain a number of provisions that impact retiree health care plans provided by employers, including a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be
taxed at a 40% rate. Additional legislation was passed in December 2015 that made some changes to the law, including moving the implementation date of the excise tax from 2018 to 2020. Although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2020,
accounting guidance requires Exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise tax in its annual actuarial valuation. The application of the legislation is still unclear and Exelon continues to monitor the Department of Labor and IRS for
additional guidance. Certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation, including projected inflation rates (based on the CPI). Exelon reflected its best estimate
of the expected impact in its annual actuarial valuation.         
    Contributions           
  The following table provides contributions made by Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and BSC to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

(a)  
  Exelon s and Generation s pension contributions include $36 million and $43 million related to the legacy CENG plans that was funded by CENG as provided in an Employee
Matters Agreement (EMA) between Exelon and CENG for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.     
          Management considers various factors when
making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act),
management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of   
         372   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution
requirements and participant notification). Additionally, the projected contribution reflects a funding strategy of contributing the greater of $250 million until the qualified plans are fully funded on an ABO basis, and the minimum amounts under
ERISA to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions.         
  Exelon plans to contribute $250 million to its qualified pension plans in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE will contribute $134
million, $30 million, $28 million, and $31 million, respectively. Exelon s and Generation s expected qualified pension plan contributions above include $25 million related to the legacy CENG plans that will be funded by CENG as provided in
an EMA between Exelon and CENG.            Unlike the qualified
pension plans, Exelon s non-qualified pension plans are not funded. Exelon plans to make non-qualified pension plan benefit payments of $21 million in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE will make payments of $9 million, $2 million,
$1 million and $1 million, respectively.            Unlike the
qualified pension plans, other postretirement plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. Exelon s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its other
postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). In 2016, Exelon anticipates funding its other
postretirement benefit plans based on the funding considerations discussed above, with the exception of those plans which remain unfunded. Exelon expects to make other postretirement benefit plan contributions, including benefit payments related to
unfunded plans, of approximately $35 million in 2016, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE expect to contribute $13 million, $3 million, $1 million, and $18 million, respectively.              Estimated Future Benefit Payments           
  Estimated future benefit payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 were:
        
            Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries
             Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE account for their
participation in Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying multi-employer accounting. Employee-related assets and

liabilities, including both pension and postretirement liabilities, for the legacy Exelon plans were allocated by Exelon to its subsidiaries based on the number of active employees as of
January 1, 2001 as part of Exelon s corporate restructuring. The obligation for Generation, ComEd and PECO reflects the initial allocation and the cumulative costs incurred and contributions made since January 1, 2001. Historically,
Exelon has allocated the components of pension and other postretirement costs to the subsidiaries in the legacy Exelon plans based upon several factors, including the measures of active employee participation in each participating unit. Pension and
other postretirement benefit contributions were allocated to legacy Exelon subsidiaries in proportion to active service costs recognized and total costs recognized, respectively. Beginning in 2015, Exelon began allocating costs related to its legacy
Exelon pension and other postretirement benefit plans to its subsidiaries based on both active and retired employee participation and contributions are allocated based on accounting cost. The impact of this allocation methodology change is not
material to any Registrant. For legacy CEG and legacy CENG plans, components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and contributions have been, and will continue to be, allocated to the subsidiaries based on employee participation (both
active and retired).            The amounts below were included in
capital expenditures and Operating and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BSC s and BGE s allocated portion of the pension and
other postretirement benefit plan costs. These amounts include the recognized contractual termination benefit charges, curtailment gains, and settlement charges:   

(a)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO or
BGE amounts above.                Plan Assets     
         Investment Strategy.  On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its
investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.     
        Exelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment
strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans
improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans  liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon s
other postretirement plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.         
  Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.71% to estimate its 2016 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.

         Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Exelon evaluated its pension and
other postretirement benefit plans  asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2015. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment
concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2015, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10% of plan assets) of risk in Exelon s pension and other
postretirement benefit plan assets.

(b)  
  In connection with the Employee Matters Agreement between EDF and Exelon, Exelon assumed the pension plan assets of Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC and Constellation Energy

(c)  
  As of January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2014, hedge fund investments that contained redemption restrictions limiting Exelon s ability to redeem the investments within
a reasonable period of time were classified as Level 3 investments. As of December 31, 2014, restrictions for certain investments no longer applied, therefore allowing redemption within a reasonable period of time from the measurement date at
NAV. As such, these hedge fund investments are reflected as transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 of $43 million in 2014.           
  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 for the pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets.             Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value
             Cash equivalents . Investments with maturities
of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring
fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.           
   Equities . Equities consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign
markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities
held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. Equity securities are
valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs. 
            Equity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained
by investment companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with the plans  overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds
which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using
the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. These funds have been categorized as Level 2.         
   Fixed income . For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, municipal
bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for
unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a
supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an
understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other 
   
         379

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    
 market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement
fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are
based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2     
        Other fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income
commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. The values of some
of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not
publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. These funds have been categorized as Level 2. Certain fixed income commingled funds
are valued using the NAV per fund share, which is based on the valuation of the underlying investments and include significant unobservable inputs. These funds have been categorized as Level 3.   
        Derivative instruments consisting primarily of interest rate swaps to
manage risk are recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.   
         Private equity . Private equity investments include those in
limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. Private equity
valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Since these valuation
inputs are not highly observable, private equity investments have been categorized as Level 3.           
   Hedge funds . Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns
and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or ownership interest of the investments. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which
may include a lock-up period or a gate. For Exelon s investments that have terms that allow redemption within a reasonable period of time from the   measurement date, the hedge fund investments are categorized as Level 2. For investments
that have restrictions that may limit Exelon s ability to redeem the investments at the measurement date or within a reasonable period of time, the hedge fund investments are categorized as Level 3.     
         Real estate . Real estate funds are funds with a direct
investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. Since these valuation inputs are not
highly observable, these real estate funds have been categorized as Level 3.               Private credit.  Private credit investments primarily consist of limited partnerships that invest in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3

 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator and include unobservable inputs such as cost,
operating results, and discounted cash flows. Since the valuation inputs are not highly observable, private credit investments have been categorized as Level 3.

Contingently Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest (Exelon, Generation)             In November 2015, 2015 ESA Investco, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, entered into an arrangement to sell a portion of its equity to a tax equity investor. Pursuant to the operating agreement, in
certain situations the equity contributions made by the noncontrolling interest holder could be contingently redeemable. These situations are outside of the control of Generation and the noncontrolling interest holder resulting in a portion of the
noncontrolling interest being considered contingently redeemable and thus presented in mezzanine equity in the consolidated balance sheet.         
  The following table summarizes the changes in the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015:

      19. Shareholder s Equity (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The following table presents common stock authorized and outstanding
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:         
          ComEd had 73,434 and 73,533 warrants
outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants.
At December 31, 2015 and 2014, 24,478 and 24,511 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for the conversion of warrants.         
   Equity Securities Offering          
  In June 2014, Exelon marketed an equity offering of 57.5 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $35 per share. In
connection with such offering, Exelon entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties. In July 2015, Exelon settled the forward sale agreement by the issuance of 57.5 million shares of Exelon common stock. Exelon received net cash
proceeds of $1.87 billion, which was calculated based on a forward price of $32.48 per share as specified in the forward sale agreements. Use of net proceeds will be to fund the pending merger with PHI and related costs and expenses, and for general
corporate purposes. The forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. As a result, no amounts were recorded in the consolidated financial statements until the July 2015 settlement of the forward sale agreements. However, prior to
the July 2015 settlement, incremental shares, if any, were included within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.         
  Concurrent with the forward equity transaction, Exelon also issued $1.15 billion of junior subordinated notes in the form of 23 million equity
units. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information on the equity units.             Share Repurchases          
   Share Repurchase Programs . There currently is no Exelon Board of Director authority to repurchase shares. Any previous shares repurchased are
held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon s management. Under the previous share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3 billion
at December 31, 2015. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Exelon had no common stock repurchases.               Preferred and Preference Securities of Subsidiaries             At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon was authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred securities, none of which were outstanding.   
         382

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   At December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd prior preferred securities and ComEd cumulative
preference securities consisted of 850,000 shares and 6,810,451 shares authorized, respectively, none of which were outstanding.         
  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, BGE cumulative preference stock, $100 par value, consisted of 6,500,000 shares authorized of which 1,900,000 are
outstanding as set forth in the table below. Shares of BGE preference stock have no voting power except for the following:         

The preference stock has one vote per share on any charter amendment that i) with regards to either dividends or distribution of assets, would create or
authorize any shares of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the preference stock or ii) substantially adversely affect the contract rights, as expressly set forth in BGE s charter, of the preference stock. Each such amendment would
require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the shares of preference stock outstanding; and            

Whenever BGE fails to pay full dividends on the preference stock and such failure continues for one year, the preference stock shall have one vote per share on
all matters, until and unless such dividends shall have been paid in full. Upon liquidation, the holders of the preference stock of each series outstanding are entitled to receive the par amount of their shares and an amount equal to the unpaid
accrued dividends.            

(a)  
  Redeemable, at the option of BGE, at the indicated dollar amounts per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.     
           20. Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Stock-Based Compensation Plans    
        Exelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily
includes stock options, restricted stock units and performance share awards. At December 31, 2015, there were approximately 16 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from authorized but unissued common stock shares.         
  The Compensation Committee of Exelon s Board of Directors changed the mix of awards granted under the LTIP in 2013 by eliminating stock options
in favor of the use of full value shares, consisting of 67% performance shares and 33% restricted stock units. The performance share awards granted in 2013 will cliff vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The performance share awards
granted in 2012 and earlier had a one-year performance period and vested ratably over three years. To address the reduction in annual award opportunity resulting from the transition to a three-year cliff vesting performance period, the Compensation
Committee also approved a one-time grant of   
         383

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
performance share transition awards in 2013, which vested one-third after one year, with the remaining balance vesting over a two-year performance period. These one-time 2013 performance share
transition awards will be settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash, except for awards granted to executive vice presidents and higher officers that may be settled 100% in cash if certain Exelon stock ownership requirements are satisfied. In
addition to this change, in 2013 ComEd and in 2014 PECO and BGE transitioned from Exelon stock-based awards to cash award programs with payouts based on the performance of each respective utility. The following tables do not include expense related
to these plans as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable accounting guidance.         
  The following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         
          The following table presents
stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE amounts above.              There were no significant
stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

   Exelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for
stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs. The following table presents
information regarding Exelon s tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         
           Stock Options    
        Non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon s common
stock were granted under the LTIP through 2012. Due to changes in the LTIP, there were no stock options granted in 2013, 2014 or 2015. For all stock options granted through 2012, the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. The vesting period of stock options is generally four years. All stock options expire ten years from the date of grant.   
        The value of stock options at the date of grant is expensed over the
requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for stock options is generally four years. However, certain stock options become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the
stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.            The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The
following table presents the weighted average assumptions used in the pricing model for grants and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the year ended 2012:   
     
          The assumptions above relate to Exelon
stock options granted in 2012 and therefore do not include stock options that were converted in connection with the merger with Constellation during the year ended 2012.   
        The dividend yield is based on several factors, including Exelon s
most recent dividend payment at the grant date and the average stock price over the previous year. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities of traded stock options in Exelon s common stock and historical volatility over the
estimated expected life of the stock options. The risk-free interest rate for a security with a term equal   
         385

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
to the expected life is based on a yield curve constructed from U.S. Treasury strips at the time of grant. For each year presented, the expected life represents the period of time the stock
options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Exelon believes that the simplified method is appropriate due to several factors that result in historical exercise data not being sufficient to determine a reasonable
estimate of expected term. Exelon uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.   
        The following table presents information with respect to stock option
activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:         

(a)  
  Includes stock options issued to retirement eligible employees.           
  The following table summarizes additional information regarding stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

(a)  
  The difference between the market value on the date of exercise and the option exercise price.     
        The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested stock option
activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:         
     
          At December 31, 2015, $0.1 million of
total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of less than a year.   
         386

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Restricted Stock Units             Restricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of
common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.   
        The value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite
service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching
retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon uses
historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.         
  The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:   

(b)  
  Represents restricted stock units that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2015.     
        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of restricted
stock units granted for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $36.55, $28.71 and $31.06, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Exelon had obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units not yet settled of
$97 million and $85 million, respectively, which are included in common stock in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Exelon settled restricted stock units with fair value totaling $75
million, $43 million and $28 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, $56 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period
of 2 years.             Performance Share Awards    
        Performance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The 2015 and 2014
performance share awards are being settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash at the end of the three-year performance period except for awards granted to executive vice presidents and higher officers that may be settled 100% in cash if certain
ownership requirements are satisfied. The performance shares granted prior to 2012 generally vest and settle over a three-year period with the holders receiving shares of common stock and/or cash annually during the vesting period.   
         387

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The common stock portion of the performance share and one-time 2013 performance share transition
awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon s stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon s current stock
price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the
compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.            For nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the graded-vesting method. For performance share and one-time performance share
transition awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.   
        The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested performance
share awards activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:         

(b)  
  Represents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2015.     
        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of performance
share awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $35.88, $28.75, and $31.55, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Exelon settled performance shares with a fair value
totaling $46 million, $27 million and $26 million, respectively, of which $29 million, $13 million and $12 million was paid in cash, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, $27 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
nonvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.4 years.         
  The following table presents the balance sheet classification of obligations related to outstanding performance share awards not yet settled:

(a)  
  Represents the current liability related to performance share awards expected to be settled in cash.     

(b)  
  Represents the long-term liability related to performance share awards expected to be settled in cash.

      21. Earnings Per Share (Exelon)    
        Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing Net income
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock outstanding under Exelon s
LTIPs considered to be common stock equivalents. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of the stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share:         
          The number of stock options not
included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was approximately 16 million in 2015, 17 million in 2014, and 20 million in 2013. The number of equity units related to the PHI merger
not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was 3 million for the year ended December 2015 and less than 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, there
were no forward units related to the PHI merger not included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Refer to Note 19 Shareholder s
Equity for further information regarding the equity units and equity forward units.            Under share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. In 2008, Exelon management decided to defer indefinitely
any share repurchases.

Contingencies (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Commitments
              Constellation Merger Commitments
             In February 2012, the MDPSC issued an Order
approving the Exelon and Constellation merger. As part of the MDPSC Order, Exelon agreed to provide a package of benefits to BGE customers, the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of
Maryland of approximately $1 billion. The direct investment estimate includes $95 million to $120 million relating to the construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses.   
        The direct investment commitment also includes $500 million to $600
million relating to Exelon and Generation s development or assistance in the development of 275 300 MWs of new generation in Maryland, which is expected to be completed within a period of 10 years. Exelon and Generation have incurred $393
million towards satisfying the commitment for new generation development in the state of Maryland, with approximately 220 MW of the new generation commencing with commercial operations to date. The MDPSC order contemplates various options for
complying with the new generation development commitments, including building or acquiring generating assets, making subsidy or compliance payments, or in circumstances in which the generation build is delayed or certain specified provisions are
elected, making liquidated damages payments. Exelon and Generation expect that the majority of these commitments will be satisfied by building or acquiring generating assets and, therefore, will be primarily capital in nature and recognized as
incurred. However, during the third quarter of 2014, the conditions associated with one of the generation development commitments changed such that Exelon and Generation now believe that the most likely outcome will involve making subsidy payments
and/or liquidated damages payments rather than constructing the specified generating plant. As a result, Exelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax $44 million loss contingency related to this generation development commitment which is included in
Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and   
         394

Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. While this $44 million loss contingency represents Generation s best estimate of the future obligation, it is reasonably
possible that Exelon and Generation could ultimately be required to make cumulative subsidy payments of up to a maximum of approximately $105 million over a 20-year period dependent on actual generating output from a successfully constructed
generating plant.              Equity Investment Commitments     
        As part of Generation s recent investments in technology
development, Generation enters into equity purchase agreements that include commitments to invest additional equity through incremental payments to fund the anticipated needs of the planned operations of the associated companies. The commitment
includes approximately $20 million of in-kind services and 100% of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC s equity commitment since 2015 ESA Investco, LLC is consolidated by Generation (see Note 2 Variable Interest Entities for additional details). As of
December 31, 2015, Generation s estimated commitment relating to its equity purchase agreements, including in-kind services contributions, is anticipated to be as follows:         

(a)  
  The noncontrolling interest holder of 2015 ESA Investco, LLC will contribute up to $172 million in support of a portion of this equity commitment.     
         Commercial Commitments             Exelon s commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015, representing commitments potentially triggered by
future events, were as follows:         

(a)  
  Letters of credit (non-debt) Exelon and certain of its subsidiaries maintain non-debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by
third parties.     

(b)  
  Surety bonds Guarantees issued related to contract and commercial agreements, excluding bid bonds.     

(c)  
  Includes $200 million of Trust Preferred Securities of ComEd Financing III, $178 million of Trust Preferred Securities of PECO Trust III and IV and $250 million of Trust
Preferred Securities of BGE Capital Trust II.     

(d)  
    Energy marketing contract guarantees Guarantees issued to ensure performance under energy commodity contracts. Amount includes approximately $3.1 billion of
guarantees issued by Exelon and Generation on behalf of its Constellation businesses to allow it the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post other forms of

collateral. The majority of these guarantees contain evergreen provisions that require the guarantee to remain in effect until cancelled. Exelon s estimated net exposure for obligations
under commercial transactions covered by these guarantees is approximately $0.5 billion at December 31, 2015, which represents the total amount Exelon could be required to fund based on December 31, 2015 market prices.

(e)  
  Nuclear insurance premiums Represents the maximum amount that Generation would be required to pay for retrospective premiums in the event of nuclear disaster at any domestic
site under the Secondary Financial Protection pool as required under the Price-Anderson Act as well as the current aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation that could be imposed by NEIL. See the Nuclear Insurance section within this note
for additional details on Generation s nuclear insurance premiums.              Generation s commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events, were as follows:         

(a)  
  Letters of credit (non-debt) Non-debt letters of credit maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties.

(b)  
  Energy marketing contract guarantees Guarantees issued to ensure performance under energy commodity contracts. Amount includes approximately $1.5 billion of guarantees
issued by Generation on behalf of its Constellation businesses to allow it the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post other forms of collateral. The majority of these guarantees contain evergreen provisions
that require the guarantee to remain in effect until cancelled. Generation s estimated net exposure for obligations under commercial transactions covered by these guarantees is approximately $0.3 billion at December 31, 2015, which
represents the total amount Generation could be required to fund based on December 31, 2015 market prices.     

(c)  
  Nuclear insurance premiums Represents the maximum amount that Generation would be required to pay for retrospective premiums in the event of nuclear disaster at any domestic
site, including CENG sites, under the Secondary Financial Protection pool as required under the Price-Anderson Act as well as the current aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation that could be imposed by NEIL. See the Nuclear Insurance
section within this note for additional details on Generation s nuclear insurance premiums.           
  ComEd s commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events, were as follows:

(a)  
  Letters of credit (non-debt) ComEd maintains non-debt letters of credit to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties.

  Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses effectively have indefinite payment periods. As a result, ComEd, PECO and BGE have excluded these payments
from the remaining years, as such amounts would not be meaningful. ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s annual obligation for these arrangements, included in each of the years 2016 2020, was $2 million, $3 million, and $1 million
respectively.

        The following table presents the Registrants  rental expense under
operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:         

(a)  
  Includes contingent operating lease payments associated with contracted generation agreements that are not included in the minimum future operating lease payments table above.
Payments made under Generation s contracted generation lease agreements totaled $798 million, $755 million and $694 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excludes contract amortization associated with purchase accounting and
contract acquisitions.              For information
regarding capital lease obligations, see Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements.             Nuclear Insurance          
  Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the
CENG nuclear stations. Generation has mitigated its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.         
  The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S.
licensed nuclear facilities and also to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2015, the current liability limit per incident  is  $13.5 billion and is subject to change
to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors. An inflation adjustment must be made at least once every 5 years and the last inflation adjustment was made effective September 10, 2013. In accordance with
the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that
could arise in the event of an incident. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $375 million for each operating site. Additionally, the Price-Anderson Act requires a second layer of protection
through the mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors (currently 103 reactors) resulting in an additional $13.1 billion in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial
protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Under the Price-Anderson Act, the maximum assessment in the event of an
incident for each nuclear operator, per reactor, per incident (including a 5% surcharge), is $127.3 million, payable at no more than $19 million per reactor per incident per year. Exelon s maximum liability per incident is approximately $2.7
billion, including CENG s related liability.            In
addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.5 billion limit for a single incident.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   As part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, Generation executed an Indemnity
Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their
operations. Exelon guarantees Generation s obligations under this indemnity. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC for additional information on Generation s operations relating to CENG.   
        Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current
levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each
facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.         
  NEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years NEIL has made distributions to its
members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will continue at all. Generation s portion of the distribution declared by NEIL is estimated to be $20.7 million for 2015, and was $18.3 million for 2014 and
$18.5 million for 2013. The distributions were recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Premiums paid to NEIL by its members are
subject to assessment for adverse loss experience (the retrospective premium obligation). NEIL has never exercised this assessment since its formation in 1973, and while Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments, or if they will be
imposed at all, as of December 31, 2015, the current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for Generation is approximately $365 million. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure
collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.   
        NEIL provides  all risk  property damage, decontamination and
premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will
be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to
Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies
for all insured plants, the maximum recovery for all losses by all insureds will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source, applicable
to such losses.            For its insured losses, Generation is
self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by
Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   
         Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation    
        Under the NWPA, the DOE is responsible for the development of a
geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to   
         399

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation
historically had paid the DOE one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. On November 19, 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to
zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. On May 9, 2014, the DOE notified Generation that the SNF disposal fee remained in effect through May 15, 2014, after which time the fee was set to zero. As a result, for the year ended
December 31, 2015, Generation did not incur any expense in SNF disposal fees. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, Generation incurred expense of $49 million and $136 million, respectively, in SNF disposal fees recorded in Purchased power
and fuel expense within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, including Exelon s share of Salem and net of co-owner reimbursements (not including such fees incurred by CENG). Until
such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. This fee may be adjusted prospectively in order to ensure full cost recovery. The NWPA and the Standard Contracts
required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its performance has been, and is expected to be, delayed
significantly.            The 2010 Federal budget (which became
effective October 1, 2009) eliminated almost all funding for the creation of the Yucca Mountain repository while the Obama administration devised a new strategy for long-term SNF management. A Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America s Nuclear
Future, appointed by the U.S. Energy Secretary, released a report on January 26, 2012, detailing comprehensive recommendations for creating a safe, long-term solution for managing and disposing of the nation s spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste.            In early 2013, the DOE issued an updated
 Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste  in response to the BRC recommendations. This strategy included a consolidated interim storage facility that is planned to be operational in
2025.            Generation uses the 2025 date as the assumed date for
when the DOE will begin accepting SNF for purposes of determining nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations.         
  In August 2004, Generation and the DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse
Generation, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at Generation s nuclear stations pending the DOE s fulfillment of its obligations. Settlement
agreements pertaining to Calvert Cliffs and Ginna were executed during 2011, and Nine Mile Point during 2012, (the  DOE Settlement Agreements ), as amended in 2014 for Calvert Cliffs and Nine Mile Point, under which the government has
agreed to reimburse the costs associated with SNF storage expended or to be expended through 2016 as a result of the DOE delays. The DOE Settlement Agreement is expected to be amended for Ginna in a similar manner as needed. Generation, including
CENG, submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases, reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.

   Under the settlement agreement, Generation has received cumulative cash reimbursements for costs
incurred as follows:         

(a)  
  Total after considering amounts due to co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek.     

(b)  
  Includes $53 million and $49 million, respectively, for amounts received since April 1, 2014, for costs incurred under the CENG DOE Settlement Agreements prior to the
consolidation of CENG.              As of
December 31, 2015, and 2014, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement has been or will be requested from the DOE under the DOE settlement agreements is as follows:         

(a)  
  Recorded in Accounts receivable, other.     

(b)  
  Recorded in Deferred debits and other assets, other     

(c)  
  Non-CENG amounts owed to co-owners are recorded in Accounts receivable, other. CENG amounts owed to co-owners are recorded in Accounts payable. Represents amounts owed to the
co-owners of Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, and Nine Mile Point Unit 2 generating facilities.           
  The Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear generation through April 6,
1983. The fee related to the former PECO units has been paid. Pursuant to the Standard Contracts, ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $277 million for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the
date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. As of December 31, 2015, the unfunded SNF liability for the one-time fee with interest was $1,021 million. Interest accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week
Treasury Rate in effect, for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2015, was 0.112%. The liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee, were transferred to Generation as part of Exelon s 2001 corporate
restructuring. The outstanding one-time fee obligations for the Nine Mile Point, Ginna, Oyster Creek and TMI units remain with the former owners. The Clinton and Calvert Cliffs units have no outstanding obligation. See Note 12 Fair Value of
Financial Assets and Liabilities for additional information.         
   Environmental Matters          
    General.   The Registrants  operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures in order to comply
with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated
by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered
hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.

   ComEd, PECO and BGE have identified sites where former MGP activities have or may have resulted in
actual site contamination. For almost all of these sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.   

ComEd has identified 42 sites, 17 of which have been remediated and approved by the Illinois EPA or the U.S. EPA and 25 that are currently under some degree of
active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2020.            

PECO has identified 26 sites, 16 of which have been remediated in accordance with applicable PA DEP regulatory requirements. The remaining 10 sites are currently
under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2021.      

BGE has identified 13 former gas manufacturing or purification sites that it currently owns or owned at one time through a predecessor s acquisition. Two
gas manufacturing sites require some level of remediation and ongoing monitoring under the direction of the MDE. The required costs at these two sites are not considered material. An investigation of an additional gas purification site was completed
during the first quarter of 2015 at the direction of the MDE. For more information, see the discussion of the Riverside site below.            
  ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering
environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the associated regulatory assets. BGE is authorized to recover, and is currently recovering,
environmental costs for the remediation of the former MGP facility sites from customers; however, while BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates. ComEd,
PECO and BGE have recorded regulatory assets for the recovery of these costs.            As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities
within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:         

(a)  
  For BGE, includes reserve for Riverside, a gas purification site. See discussion below for additional information.

   The historical nature of the MGP sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and
built over, impacts the ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using
all available information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any
significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.         
  During the third quarter of 2015, ComEd and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. For ComEd, the
results of the study resulted in a $50 million increase to ComEd s environmental liabilities and related regulatory assets. The increase at ComEd was primarily driven by refined assumptions and scopes based on further experience and analysis,
including one site where a new option is being considered for a facility under which contamination exists and certain sites where another PRP leads the remediation efforts and ComEd shares responsibility. For PECO, the results of the study resulted
in a $1 million decrease to PECO s environmental liabilities and related regulatory assets.            The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur other significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants,
environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers.         
    Water Quality           
    Groundwater Contamination.   In October 2007, a subsidiary of Constellation entered into a consent decree with the MDE relating to
groundwater contamination at a third-party facility that was licensed to accept fly ash, a byproduct generated by coal-fired plants. The consent decree required the payment of a $1 million penalty, remediation of groundwater contamination resulting
from the ash placement operations at the site, replacement of drinking water supplies in the vicinity of the site, and monitoring of groundwater conditions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Generation s remaining groundwater contamination
reserve was $12 million and $13 million respectively.              
    Air Quality           
    Notices and Finding of Violations and Midwest Generation Bankruptcy.   In December 1999, ComEd sold several generating stations to
Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation), a subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy (EME). Under the terms of the sale agreement, Midwest Generation and EME assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities associated with the ownership,
occupancy, use and operation of the stations, including responsibility for compliance by the stations with environmental laws before their purchase by Midwest Generation. Midwest Generation and EME additionally agreed to indemnify and hold ComEd and
its affiliates harmless from claims, fines, penalties, liabilities and expenses arising from third party claims against ComEd resulting from or arising out of the environmental liabilities assumed by Midwest Generation and EME under the terms of the
agreement governing the sale. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed ComEd s rights and obligations with respect to its former generation business, including its rights and obligations under the sale
agreement with Midwest Generation and EME.

   Under a supplemental agreement reached in 2003, Midwest Generation agreed to reimburse ComEd and
Generation for 50% of the specific asbestos claims pending as of February 2003 and related expenses less recovery of insurance costs and agreed to a sharing arrangement for liabilities and expenses associated with future asbestos-related claims as
specified in the agreement.            On December 17, 2012
(Petition Date), EME and certain of its subsidiaries, including Midwest Generation, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.         
  In 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved the rejection of an agency agreement related to a coal rail car lease under which Midwest Generation had
agreed to reimburse ComEd for all obligations incurred under the coal rail car lease. The rejection left Generation as the party responsible for making all remaining payments under the lease and performing all other obligations thereunder. A
settlement was reached in January 2015, to resolve the claims related to the coal rail car lease for approximately $14 million and Exelon recorded a gain upon receipt of the funds, within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. No further action is expected related to the rail car lease.         
  On March 11, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered its Order Confirming Debtors  Joint Chapter 11 Plan
of Reorganization. On April 1, 2014 (Effective Date), NRG Energy purchased EME s portfolio of generation, including Midwest Generation and the Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (Plan) became effective. As part of the Plan, the sale
agreement, including the environmental indemnity, and the asbestos cost-sharing agreement were rejected.         
  Generation increased its reserve for asbestos-related bodily injury claims pertaining to Midwest Generations  share of liability as a result of
the rejection of the asbestos cost sharing agreement in the bankruptcy proceedings. Exelon and Generation may be entitled to damages associated with the rejection of the agreement and a claim has been filed by Exelon for such damages. These amounts
are considered to be contingent gains and would not be recognized until realized.            As a prior owner of the generating stations, ComEd (and Generation, through its agreement in Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring to assume ComEd s rights and obligations associated with its former
generation business) could face liability (along with any other potentially responsible parties) for environmental conditions at the stations requiring remediation, with the determination of the allocation among the parties subject to many uncertain
factors. ComEd and Generation are unable to predict whether and to what extent they may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to the generating stations and as a result no liability has been recorded as of
December 31, 2015. Any liability imposed on ComEd or Generation for environmental matters relating to the generating stations could have a material adverse impact on their future results of operations and cash flows.   
          Solid and Hazardous Waste     
          Cotter Corporation.   The U.S. EPA has advised Cotter
Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. On February 18, 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated
third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was
transferred to Generation. On May 29, 2008, the U.S. EPA issued a Record of Decision approving the remediation option submitted by Cotter and the two other PRPs that required

  additional landfill cover. By letter dated January 11, 2010, the U.S. EPA requested that the PRPs perform a supplemental feasibility study for a remediation alternative that would
involve complete excavation of the radiological contamination. On September 30, 2011, the PRPs submitted the final supplemental feasibility study to the U.S. EPA for review. Since, June 2012, the U.S. EPA has requested that the PRPs perform a
series of additional analyses and groundwater and soil sampling as part of the supplemental feasibility study, that are now scheduled to be completed in mid-2016 to enable the EPA to propose a remedy for public comment by the end of 2016. Thereafter
the U.S. EPA will select a final remedy and enter into a Consent Decree with the PRPs to effectuate the remedy. A complete excavation remedy would be significantly more expensive than the previously selected additional cover remedy; however,
Generation believes the likelihood that the U.S. EPA would require a complete excavation remedy is remote. The U.S. EPA is also reviewing a partial excavation remedy; however, until the current sampling is concluded there is no basis to determine
the likelihood and estimate of a partial excavation remedy. The current estimated cost of the landfill cover remediation for the site is approximately $60 million, which will be allocated among all PRPs. Recent investigation has identified a number
of other parties who may be PRPs and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy. Further investigation is underway. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated share of such liability.   
             During December 2015, the U.S. EPA took two actions
related to the West Lake Landfill designed to abate what it termed as imminent and dangerous conditions at the landfill. The first involved installation of a non-combustible interim surface cover to protect against surface fires in areas where
radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated liability for this interim action. The second action involved EPA s public statement that it
will require the PRPs to construct a barrier wall in an adjacent landfill to prevent a subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, EPA has not
provided sufficient details related to the basis for and the requirements and design of a barrier wall to enable Generation to determine the likelihood such a remedy will ultimately be implemented, assess the degree to which Generation may have
liability as a potentially responsible party, or develop a reasonable estimate of the potential incremental costs. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Generation s and
Exelon s future results of operations and cash flows. Finally, one of the other PRPs, the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill, has indicated that it will be making a contribution claim against Cotter for costs that it has
incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, Generation and Exelon do not possess sufficient information to assess this
claim and are therefore unable to determine the impact on their future results of operations and cash flows.         
  On February 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to transfer remediation authority over the West Lake landfill from the U.S. EPA to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Such legislation would become final upon passage in the U.S. House of Representatives and the signature of the President, and be subject to annual funding
appropriations in the U.S. Budget. Remediation under FUSRAP would not alter the liability of the PRPs, but could delay the determination of a final remedy and its implementation.   
        On August 8, 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is
considered a PRP with respect to the government s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty Avenue site
is included in ComEd s indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale   
         405

of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. government s Manhattan Project. Cotter purchased the
residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In 1976, the NRC found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination of land
areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. The DOJ has not yet formally advised the PRPs of the amount that it is
seeking, but it is believed to be approximately $90 million. The DOJ and the PRPs agreed to toll the statute of limitations until August 2016 so that settlement discussions could proceed. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it appears
probable that Generation has liability to Cotter under the indemnification agreement and has established an appropriate accrual for this liability.         
  Commencing in February 2012, 37 lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Among the defendants were
Exelon, Generation and ComEd, all of which were subsequently dismissed from the case, and Cotter, which remains a defendant. The suits allege that individuals living in the North St. Louis area developed some form of cancer due to Cotter s
negligent or reckless conduct in processing, transporting, storing, handling and/or disposing of radioactive materials. Plaintiffs have asserted claims for negligence, strict liability, emotional distress, medical monitoring, and violations of the
Price-Anderson Act. The complaints do not contain specific damage claims. In the event of a finding of liability, it is reasonably possible that Exelon would be considered liable due to its indemnification responsibilities of Cotter described above.
The court has dismissed the lawsuits filed by 30 of the plaintiffs. Pre-trial motions and discovery are proceeding in the remaining cases and a proposed pre-trial scheduling order has been filed with the court. At this stage of the litigation,
Generation and ComEd cannot estimate a range of loss, if any.         
    68th Street Dump.   In 1999, the U.S. EPA proposed to add the 68th Street Dump in Baltimore, Maryland to the Superfund National
Priorities List, and notified BGE and 19 others that they are PRPs at the site. In March 2004, BGE and other PRPs formed the 68th Street Coalition and entered into consent order negotiations with the U.S. EPA to investigate clean-up options for the
site under the Superfund Alternative Sites Program. In May 2006, a settlement among the U.S. EPA and 19 of the PRPs, including BGE, with respect to investigation of the site became effective. The settlement requires the PRPs, over the course of
several years, to identify contamination at the site and recommend clean-up options. The PRPs submitted their investigation of the range of clean-up options in the first quarter of 2011. Although the investigation and options provided to the U.S.
EPA are still subject to U.S. EPA review and selection of a remedy, the range of estimated clean-up costs to be allocated among all of the PRPs is in the range of $50 million to $64 million. On September 30, 2013, U.S. EPA issued the Record of
Decision identifying its preferred remedial alternative for the site. The estimated cost for the alternative chosen by U.S. EPA is consistent with the PRPs  estimated range of costs noted above. Based on Generation s preliminary review, it
appears probable that Generation has liability and has established an appropriate accrual for its share of the estimated clean-up costs. A wholly owned subsidiary of Generation has agreed to indemnify BGE for most of the costs related to this
settlement and clean-up of the site.             
    Rossville Ash Site.   The Rossville Ash Site is a 32-acre property located in Rosedale, Baltimore County, Maryland, which was used for
the placement of fly ash from 1983-2007. The property is owned by Constellation Power Source Generation, LLC (CPSG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Generation. In 2008, CPSG investigated and remediated the property by entering it into the Maryland
Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) to address any historic environmental concerns and ready the site for appropriate future redevelopment. The site was accepted into the program in 2010 and is currently

  going through the process to remediate the site and receive closure from MDE. Exelon currently estimates the cost to close the site to be approximately $9 million, which has been fully
reserved as of December 31, 2015.             
    Sauer Dump.   On May 30, 2012, BGE was notified by the U.S. EPA that it is considered a PRP at the Sauer Dump Superfund site in
Dundalk, Maryland. The U.S. EPA offered BGE and three other PRPs the opportunity to conduct an environmental investigation and present cleanup recommendations at the site. In addition, the U.S. EPA is seeking recovery from the PRPs of $1.7 million
for past cleanup and investigation costs at the site. On March 11, 2013, BGE and three other PRPs signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the U.S. EPA which requires the PRPs to conduct a remedial investigation
and feasibility study at the site to determine what, if any, are the appropriate and recommended cleanup activities for the site. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding is uncertain. Since the U.S. EPA has not selected a cleanup remedy and the
allocation of the cleanup costs among the PRPs has not been determined, an estimate of the range of BGE s reasonably possible loss, if any, cannot be determined.       
          Riverside   .      In 2013, the Maryland
Department of the Environment (MDE), at the request of U.S. EPA, conducted a site inspection and limited environmental sampling of certain portions of the 170 acre Riverside property owned by BGE. The site consists of several different parcels with
different current and historical uses. The sampling included soil and groundwater samples for a number of potential environmental contaminants. The sampling confirmed the existence of contaminants consistent with the known historical uses of the
various portions of the site. In March 2014, the MDE requested that BGE conduct an investigation of three specific areas of the site, and a site-wide investigation of soils, sediment, groundwater, and surface water to complement the MDE sampling.
The field investigation was completed in January 2015, and a final report was provided to MDE on     June 2, 2015. On November 3, 2015, MDE provided BGE with its comments and recommendations on the report which require BGE to
conduct further investigation and sampling at the site to better delineate the nature and extent of historic contamination, including off-site sediment and soil sampling.     MDE did not request any interim remediation at this time. Upon
completion of the investigation the MDE will determine if the site requires further action and/or remediation. Based upon the investigation to date, BGE has established what it believes is an appropriate reserve. As the investigation and potential
remediation proceed, it is possible that additional reserves could be established, in amounts that could be material to BGE.             
   Litigation and Regulatory Matters          
    Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE).                Exelon and Generation.   Generation maintains a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal
injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The reserve is recorded on an undiscounted basis and excludes the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters,
which could be material.                At December 31,
2015 and 2014, Generation had reserved approximately $95 million and $100 million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $21 million of this amount related to 228 open claims
presented to Generation, while the remaining $74 million of the reserve is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2050, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual
basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether an adjustment to the reserve is necessary.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   On November 22, 2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the Pennsylvania Workers
Compensation Act does not apply to an employee s disability or death resulting from occupational disease, such as diseases related to asbestos exposure, which manifests more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based
exposure, and that therefore the exclusivity provision of the Act does not preclude such employee from suing his or her employer in court. The Supreme Court s ruling reverses previous rulings by the Pennsylvania Superior Court precluding
current and former employees from suing their employers in court, despite the fact that the same employee was not eligible for workers compensation benefits for diseases that manifest more than 300 weeks after the employee s last
employment-based exposure to asbestos. Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s ruling in November 2013, Exelon, Generation, and PECO have experienced an increase in asbestos-related personal injury claims brought by former PECO employees, all of
which have been reserved against on a claim by claim basis. Those additional claims are taken into account in projecting estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims.   
        On November 4, 2015, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the
provisions of the Illinois  Workers  Compensation Act and the Workers  Occupational Diseases Act barred an employee from bringing a direct civil action against an employer for latent diseases, including asbestos-related diseases that
fall outside the 25-year limit of the statute of repose. The Illinois Supreme Court s ruling reversed previous rulings by the Illinois Court of Appeals, which initially ruled that the Illinois Worker s Compensation law should not apply in
cases where the diagnosis of an asbestos related disease occurred after the 25-year maximum time period for filing a Worker s Compensation claim. As a result of this ruling, Exelon, Generation, and ComEd have not recorded an increase to the
asbestos-related bodily injury liability as of December 31, 2015.            There is a reasonable possibility that Exelon may have additional exposure to estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims in excess of the amount accrued and the increases could have a material adverse
effect on Exelon s, Generation s and PECO s future results of operations and cash flows.         
    BGE.   Since 1993, BGE and certain Constellation (now Generation) subsidiaries have been involved in several actions concerning
asbestos. The actions are based upon the theory of  premises liability,  alleging that BGE and Generation knew of and exposed individuals to an asbestos hazard. In addition to BGE and Generation, numerous other parties are defendants in
these cases.                Approximately 454 individuals
who were never employees of BGE or certain Constellation subsidiaries have pending claims each seeking several million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. Cross-claims and third-party claims brought by other defendants may also be filed
against BGE and certain Constellation subsidiaries in these actions. To date, most asbestos claims which have been resolved have been dismissed or resolved without any payment by BGE or certain Constellation subsidiaries and a small minority of
these cases has been resolved for amounts that were not material to BGE or Generation s financial results.         
  Discovery begins in these cases after they are placed on the trial docket. At present, only two of the pending cases are set for trial. Given the
limited discovery in these cases, BGE and Generation do not know the specific facts that are necessary to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss relating to these claims; as such, no accrual has been made and a range of loss is not
estimable. The specific facts not known include:         

the identity of the facilities at which the plaintiffs allegedly worked as contractors;      

the names of the plaintiffs  employers;      
         408

the dates on which and the places where the exposure allegedly occurred; and            

the facts and circumstances relating to the alleged exposure.      
        Insurance and hold harmless agreements from contractors who employed
the plaintiffs may cover a portion of any awards in the actions.              Continuous Power Interruption (ComEd)              Section 16-125 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that in the event an electric utility, such as ComEd, experiences a continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in
ComEd s case) more than 30,000 customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as a result of the interruption and may be responsible for reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses
incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek from the ICC a waiver of these liabilities when the utility can show that the cause of the interruption was unpreventable damage
due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, ComEd did not have any material liabilities recorded for these storm events.   
          Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit (ComEd)
             On November 19, 2013, a class action
complaint was filed in the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of a single individual and a presumptive class that would include all customers that ComEd enrolled in its Outage Alert text message program. The complaint alleged that ComEd
violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending text messages to customers without first obtaining their consent to receive such messages. The complaint sought certification of a class along with statutory damages, attorneys 
fees, and an order prohibiting ComEd from sending additional text messages. ComEd and the plaintiff agreed in principle to settle the suit for $5 million, with payments to the class commencing in the fourth quarter 2015.   
          Fund Transfer Restrictions (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)              Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or
receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.   
        The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or
director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital account  is
undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as: (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed; (2) the dividend is not
excessive; and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations are materially
limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.         
  Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient
to declare and pay same after provision is made for   
         409

reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will
not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its
guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued.   
        PECO s Articles of Incorporation prohibit payment of any dividend
on, or other distribution to the holders of, common stock if, after giving effect thereto, the capital of PECO represented by its common stock together with its retained earnings is, in the aggregate, less than the involuntary liquidating value of
its then outstanding preferred securities. On May 1, 2013, PECO redeemed all outstanding preferred securities. As a result, the above ratio calculation is no longer applicable. Additionally, PECO may not declare dividends on any shares of its
capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of
distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued.   
        BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the
MDPSC. First, BGE was prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be
below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC
that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends unless: (1) BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20%
Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on BGE s preference stock have not been paid.   
          Baltimore City Franchise Taxes (BGE)     
        The City of Baltimore claims that BGE has maintained electric
facilities in the City s public right-of-ways for over one hundred years without the proper franchise rights from the City. BGE has reviewed the City s claim and believes that it lacks merit. BGE has not recorded an accrual for payment of
franchise fees for past periods as a range of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Franchise fees assessed in future periods may be material to BGE s results of operations and cash flows.   
          General (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
             The Registrants are involved in various other
litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of
complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible
loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or

   The following tables provide additional information about liabilities of the Registrants at
December 31, 2015 and 2014.         

(a)  
  Primarily includes accrued payroll, bonuses and other incentives, vacation and benefits.     
             25. Segment Information (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Operating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on
information used by the chief operating decision maker(s) (CODM) in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.         
  Exelon has nine reportable segments, which include ComEd, PECO, BGE and Generation s six power marketing reportable segments, consisting of the
Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and all other power regions referred to collectively as  Other Power Regions , which includes activities in the South, West and Canada. ComEd, PECO and BGE each represent a single
reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE s CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO and BGE based on net income and return on
equity.            The basis for Generation s reportable segments
is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity
through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation s hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation s six reportable segments are as follows:

Mid-Atlantic  represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of
Columbia and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.      
         419   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

Midwest  represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and
Tennessee, and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO s Southern Region, which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not
covered by PJM, and parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky.            

New England  represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.

New York  represents operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety.      

ERCOT  represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas.      

Other Power Regions :            

South  represents operations in the FRCC, MISO s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM, which
includes all or most of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of Missouri, Kentucky and Texas. Generation s South region also includes operations in the SPP, covering
Kansas, Oklahoma, most of Nebraska and parts of New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.            

West  represents operations in the WECC, which includes California ISO, and covers the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
Idaho, Colorado, and parts of New Mexico, Wyoming and South Dakota.            

Canada  represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.      
        The CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of
Generation s power marketing activities and allocate resources based on revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense (RNF). Generation believes that RNF is a useful measurement of operational performance. RNF is not a presentation defined
under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated
sales to ComEd, PECO, and BGE. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation s owned
generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of Generation s other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional
reportable segment amounts. These activities include natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation s overall operating revenues or results of operations. Further, Generation s
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedging activities and its amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also not included in
the regional reportable segment amounts. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.

(a)  
  Generation includes the six power marketing reportable segments shown below: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, intersegment revenues for Generation include revenue from sales to PECO of $224 million and sales to BGE of $502 million in the Mid-Atlantic region, and sales to ComEd of $18 million in the Midwest region, which eliminate
upon consolidation. For the year ended December 31, 2014, intersegment revenues for Generation include revenue from sales to PECO of $198 million and sales to BGE of $387 million in the Mid-Atlantic region, and sales to ComEd of $176 million in
the Midwest region, which eliminate upon consolidation. For the year ended December 31, 2013, intersegment revenues for Generation include revenue from sales to PECO of $405 million and sales to BGE of $455 million in the Mid-Atlantic region,
and sales to ComEd of $506 million in the Midwest region, net of $7 million related to the unrealized mark-to-market losses related to the ComEd swap, which eliminate upon consolidation.     

(b)  
  Other primarily includes Exelon s corporate operations, shared service entities and other financing and investment activities.     

(d)  
  Intersegment revenues exclude sales to unconsolidated affiliates. The intersegment profit associated with Generation s sale of certain products and services by and between
Exelon s segments is not eliminated in consolidation due to the recognition of intersegment profit in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance. For Exelon, these amounts are included in operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income.               Generation total
revenues:          

(a)  
  On April 1, 2014, Generation assumed operational control of CENG s nuclear fleet. As a result, beginning on April 1, 2014, CENG s revenues are included on a
fully consolidated basis.     

(b)  
  Includes all wholesale and retail electric sales to third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE.     

(c)  
  Other represents activities not allocated to a region. See text above for a description of included activities. Also includes a $7 million increase to revenues, a $289
million decrease to revenues, and a $767 million decrease to revenues for the amortization of intangible assets related to commodity contracts recorded at fair value for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively,
unrealized mark-to-market gains of $203 million, losses of $174 million, and gains of $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and elimination of intersegment revenues.     

(d)  
    Exelon corrected an error in the December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 balances within Intersegment revenues and Revenues from external customers for
an overstatement of Intersegment revenues for Reportable Segments of $284 million and

power and fuel expense are included on a fully consolidated basis.     

(b)  
  Includes purchases and sales from third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE.     

(c)  
  Other represents activities not allocated to a region. See text above for a description of included activities. Also includes a $8 million increase in RNF, a $124 million
decrease in RNF, and a $488 million decrease in RNF for the amortization of intangible assets related to commodity contracts recorded at fair value for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, unrealized mark-to-market
gains of $257 million, losses of $591 million, and gains of $504 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and the elimination of intersegment revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense.

(d)  
  Exelon corrected an error in the December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 balances within Intersegment RNF and RNF from external customers for an understatement of $8
million and an overstatement of $134 million of Intersegment RNF for Reportable Segments for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an understatement of RNF from external customers for Reportable Segments of $11 million and
$134 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an overstatement of $8 million and an understatement $134 million of Intersegment RNF for Other for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and an
overstatement of RNF from external customers for Other of $11 million and $134 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This also included an understatement of total RNF for Reportable Segments and an overstatement
of total RNF for Other of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The error is not considered material to any prior period, and there is no net impact to Generation Total RNF for 2013 or 2014.

   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE      
         Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE    
        None.         

ITEM 9A.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                  Exelon,   Generation,   ComEd,   PECO and   BGE Disclosure Controls and
Procedures             During the fourth quarter of 2015, each
registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of that registrant s disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting of information in that registrant s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including
its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be included in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as
applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.   
        Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.   
         Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting             Each registrant continually
strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s internal control over financial
reporting.            During 2015 management included an assessment of
internal controls over financial reporting of Integrys, a business acquired on November 1, 2014, that was excluded from management s prior year evaluation consistent with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an
assessment of internal controls of a recently acquired business may be omitted. The total revenues related to the Integrys business are 7.45% and 11.46%, respectively, and total assets related to Integrys are approximately 0.53% and 1.08%,
respectively, of Exelon s and Generation s related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.         
   Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
        Management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. As a result of that assessment, management determined   
         435   

Table of Contents  

that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2015 and, therefore, concluded that each registrant s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

  Balance includes stock options, unvested performance shares, and unvested restricted shares that were granted under the Exelon LTIP or predecessor company plans and shares
awarded under those plans and deferred into the stock deferral plan, as well as deferred stock units granted to directors as part of their compensation. For performance shares granted in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the total includes the maximum number of

The deferred stock units granted to directors includes 338,000 shares to be issued upon the conversion of deferred stock units awarded to members of the Exelon board of directors, and 102,000 shares to be issued upon the conversion of stock units
held by members of the Exelon board of directors that were earned under a legacy Constellation Energy Group plan. Conversion of stock units to shares will occur after the director terminates service to the Exelon board or the board of any of its
subsidiary companies. See Note 20 Common Stock of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the material features of the plans.

         Schedule I   Condensed Financial Information of Parent (Exelon
Corporate)              Notes to Financial Statements
             1. Basis of Presentation    
        Exelon Corporate is a holding company that conducts substantially all
of its business operations through its subsidiaries. These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Rule 12-04, Schedule I of Regulation S-X. These statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Exelon Corporation.            Exelon Corporate owns 100% of all of its significant subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), of which Exelon Corporate owns more than 99%, and BGE, of which
Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of BGE s preferred stock. Exelon owned none of PECO s preference securities, which PECO redeemed in 2013.   
         2. Mergers    
        On April 29, 2014, Exelon and Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) signed
an agreement and plan of merger (as subsequently amended and restated as of July 18, 2014, the Merger Agreement) to combine the two companies in an all cash transaction. The resulting company will retain the Exelon name. See Note
4 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Merger Agreement with PHI.   
        For BGE s debt, the difference between fair value and book value
of BGE s assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as a regulatory asset at Exelon Corporate as Exelon did not apply push-down accounting to BGE as part of the 2012 Constellation Merger. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value of BGE long-term debt regulatory asset.         
   3. Debt and Credit Agreements          
    Short-Term Borrowings           
  Exelon Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Exelon Corporate had no commercial
paper borrowings at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.         
    Credit Agreements           
  On May 30, 2014, Exelon Corporate amended and extended its unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of
$500 million through May 2019. As of December 31, 2015, Exelon Corporation had available capacity under those commitments of $474 million. See Note 14 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information regarding Exelon Corporation s credit agreement.

 FORM OF EXELON CORPORATION UNFUNDED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

Form of Exelon Corporation Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan 

Exhibit 10.3   
  Exelon Corporation   
  Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors   
  (Amended and Restated Effective March 12, 2012)   
 The purpose of this Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the  Plan ) is to permit Directors of Exelon Corporation
( Exelon ) to elect to defer receipt of directors  fees. The Plan as set forth herein is an amendment and restatement of the Plan as originally adopted effective October 20, 2000 and previously amended and restated as of January 1,
2009 and January 1, 2011, and is a successor to the PECO Energy Company Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the  Prior Plan ).  
 1.  Administration . The Plan shall be administered by the Corporate Secretary of Exelon or his or her designee (the
 Secretary ), or such other individual or individuals as designated by the Board of Directors of Exelon (the  Exelon Board ). The Secretary shall interpret the Plan and establish such rules and regulations of plan
administration that he or she deems appropriate. The cost of plan administration shall be paid by Exelon and its participating subsidiaries, and shall not be charged against the deferred accounts of Plan participants.  
 2.  Eligibility . All Directors of Exelon (other than full-time employees of Exelon or its subsidiaries) shall be eligible to
participate in the Plan. Effective as of January 1, 2011, all Directors of Commonwealth Edison Company ( ComEd ) and PECO Energy Company ( PECO ) who are not full-time employees of Exelon or its subsidiaries shall also be
eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition, effective as of March 12, 2012, all Directors of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ( BGE ) who are not full-time employees of Exelon or its subsidiaries shall also be eligible to
participate in the Plan.    3.  Deferrals . (a) Prior to the first day of each calendar year, each eligible Director may
elect in writing to defer the receipt of all or a portion of his or her directors  fees  

earned with respect to his or her service on the board of directors of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and/or BGE (each such board of directors, a  Board ) for such calendar year, by filing a
written Director s deferral agreement form with the Secretary with respect to each such Board on which the Director serves. A Director who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after the first day of any calendar year shall be
permitted to make the election described in this Section 3 not later than 30 days after becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, and such election shall apply only to directors  fees earned during the remainder of such calendar year. In
all events, each deferral election made under this Plan shall apply only to fees earned after the date of such election. Deferred amounts under the Plan, together with deferred amounts and attributable earnings under the Prior Plan, shall be
credited to a deferral account in the participant s name ( Deferral Account ) for later distribution. Each participant s Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping entry only, and none of Exelon, ComEd, PECO or BGE shall be required
to fund the Deferral Account. Any assets that may be held to fund a Deferral Account shall at all times remain unrestricted assets of Exelon, ComEd, PECO or BGE in its corporate capacity and not as a fiduciary, and shall be subject to the
claims of its general creditors. Pending distribution, each participant s Deferral Account shall be credited with earnings or interest as provided in Section 3(b).  
 (b) (1) For purposes of measuring the earnings or losses credited to a participant s Deferral Account, the participant may select, from
among the investment funds available from time to time under the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the  Savings Plan ), the investment funds in which all or part of his or her Deferral Account shall be deemed to be invested.  
 (2) The participant shall make an investment designation in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary, which shall remain
effective until another valid  
      -2-  

designation has been made by the participant as herein provided. The Secretary may, but need not, permit separate investment designations with respect to amounts attributable to fees earned
with respect to service on each Board. The participant may amend his or her investment designation at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the Secretary. A timely change to the participant s investment designation shall
become effective as soon as administratively practicable after such designation is submitted.    (3) The investment funds deemed to be
made available to the participant, and any limitation on the maximum or minimum percentages of the participant s Deferral Account that may be deemed to be invested in any particular fund, shall be the same as available or in effect from time to
time under the Savings Plan.    (4) Except as provided below, the participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to be invested
in accordance with his or her investment designations, and the Deferral Account shall be credited with earnings (or losses) as if invested as directed by the participant.  
 To the extent that the participant does not furnish complete investment instructions, then the Deferral Account shall be deemed invested in
the default investment fund then in effect under the Savings Plan. The Deferral Accounts maintained pursuant to the Plan are for bookkeeping purposes only and Exelon is under no obligation to invest such amounts.  
 Exelon shall provide a statement to each participant not less frequently than annually showing such information as is appropriate, including
the aggregate amount in his or her Deferral Account, as of a reasonably current date.    4.  Distributions . (a) The amount
credited to a participant s Deferral Account with respect to his or her participation on each Board shall be distributed to the participant in, or beginning in, April of the first year beginning after the occurrence of one of the following
 
      -3-  

distribution events, as the participant shall direct in his or her Benefit Distribution Election Form: (i) the participant s separation from service, within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), as a Director of Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE and their affiliates, (ii) the participant s 65th birthday or (iii) the participant s 72 nd  birthday. Distributions shall be paid in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years, as the participant shall direct in his or her Benefit Distribution Election
Form. Each installment payment shall be determined by multiplying the balance remaining to the credit of the Deferral Account as of March 31 of such year (including earnings or interest credited under Section 3) by a fraction, the numerator of
which is  1  and the denominator of which is the number of years (including the current year) for which payments are yet to be made. Any unpaid balance in the Deferral Account shall be credited with earnings or interest as provided in
Section 3. In the event a Director who has elected a distribution event based on his or her 65 th  or 72 nd  birthday continues to serve as a
Director after the date such distributions commence, then in the year prior to the year in which such distributions commence such Director shall file a new Benefit Distribution Election Form governing any amounts credited to his or her Deferral
Account after the date such distributions commence. If the Director does not file such new Benefit Distribution Election Form, then the Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive a lump sum distribution of any such amounts upon the
Director s separation from service.    (b) Except as permitted under Section 4(c) or 4(d), each Director must submit a Benefit
Distribution Election Form for amounts attributable to fees earned with respect to service on a Board at the time such Director makes his or her initial deferral election under the Plan with respect to his or her service on such Board (provided that
a Director who participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2009 and had not commenced distributions must have submitted such form not later than December 31, 2008). If a Director does not submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form
 
      -4-  

during this period, then such Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive the portion of his or her Account attributable to fees earned for service on such Board in the form of
installments payments over a period of ten years upon the Director s separation from service.    (c) Notwithstanding Sections 4(a) and
4(b), each participant who had not commenced and was not scheduled to commence the receipt of distributions under the Plan on or before December 31, 2007 was permitted to submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form on or before June 30, 2007 which
provided for the payment of such participant s Deferral Account (i) at any of the times and in any of the forms permitted under Section 4(a) of the Plan or (ii) in a lump sum payment in the first quarter of 2008; provided that such election did
not cause any payment to be made in 2007 and did not apply to any payment that otherwise would be paid in 2007. This special election right was intended to comply with the transition rule set forth in IRS Notice 2005-1, Q A-19(c), and
extended in the preamble to regulations proposed under Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2006-79, which permits participants in deferred compensation plans to change the date on which deferred compensation is payable.  
 (d) A Director may elect to change the time and/or method of his or her distributions payable under the Plan in accordance with procedures
prescribed by the Secretary; provided that, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, any such change in a distribution election (i) shall not be effective until 12 months after it is submitted to the Secretary, (ii) must be submitted to the
Secretary at least 12 months prior to the date on which such distributions were previously scheduled to commence and (iii) must provide for distributions to commence at least five years after the date on which such distributions were previously
scheduled to commence. No more than one such election change shall be permissible with respect to the portion of a Director s account attributable to service with any Board.  
      -5-  

5.  Death Benefits . Each participant shall designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to
receive any remaining amounts payable from his or her Deferral Account after the participant s death. The beneficiaries, and any priority or allocation between them, shall be designated in the manner specified by the Secretary. If a participant
dies before the entire balance in his or her Deferral Account has been paid out, the remaining balance shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum upon the participant s death. If the participant is not survived by a designated beneficiary,
the participant s beneficiary shall be the participant s spouse, if living, or otherwise, the participant s estate. If a beneficiary survives the participant but dies before the entire balance payable to him or her has been
distributed, any remaining balance shall be paid to the beneficiary s estate in a lump sum. In the absence of contrary proof, the participant shall be deemed to have survived any designated beneficiary. A participant may change his or
her beneficiary designation under this Section at any time until his or her death by filing a written beneficiary designation with the Secretary, in the manner specified by the Secretary.  
 6.  Unforeseeable Financial Emergency . The Secretary may, in his or her discretion, direct that a participant be paid an amount in cash
(not in excess of the balance of his or her Deferral Account) sufficient to meet an unforeseeable emergency. An  unforeseeable emergency  means (i) a severe financial hardship to a Director resulting from an illness or accident of the
Director, or the spouse or a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code) of the Director, (ii) the loss of a Director s property due to casualty or (iii) such other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a
result of events beyond the control of the Director, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. A Director s written request for such a payment shall describe the circumstances which the Director believes justify the payment and an
estimate of the amount necessary to eliminate the unforeseeable emergency. An immediate payment to satisfy an unforeseeable emergency will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the emergency need,
 
      -6-  

plus an amount necessary to pay any taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such payment, and will not be made to the extent the need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation, by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Director s assets (to the extent such liquidation itself would not cause severe financial hardship). Any payment from a Director s Deferral Account on account of an
unforeseeable emergency shall be deemed to cancel any Deferral Election of the Director then in effect and the Director shall not be permitted to participate in the Plan until the next following calendar year.  
 7.  No Assignment or Alienation of Benefits . Except as hereinafter provided with respect to a domestic relations order, a
participant s Deferral Account may not be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or alienated. In cases of marital dispute, Exelon will observe the terms of the Plan unless and until ordered to do otherwise pursuant to a domestic relations
order, as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code. As a condition of participation, a participant agrees to hold Exelon harmless from any claim that arises out of Exelon s obeying the terms of a domestic relations order, whether
such order effects a judgment of such court or is issued to enforce a judgment or order of another court.    8.  Amendment or
Termination . The Plan may be altered, amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Exelon Board, provided that, except as otherwise provided herein or as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, no such action shall result in the
distribution of amounts credited to the Deferral Accounts of any participant in any manner other than is provided in the Plan, nor shall such action reduce the availability of amounts previously deferred. To the extent permitted by Section
409A, the Exelon Board may, in its discretion, terminate the Plan with respect to Exelon, ComEd, PECO and/or BGE and accelerate the payment of all Deferral Accounts to the extent related to service on the Board for which the Plan is terminated:  
 (a) within 12 months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the Code, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11
U.S.C.  503(b)(1)(A), provided that the payments with respect to each such Deferral Account are included in the Director s gross income in the later of (i) the calendar year in which the Plan termination occurs or (ii) the first calendar
year in which the payments are administratively practicable;  
      -7-  

(b) in connection with a  change in control event,  as defined in, and to the extent
permitted under, Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or    (c) upon any other termination event permitted
under Section 409A of the Code.    9.  Compliance With Section 409A of the Code . The Plan is intended to comply with the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code, and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. Exelon shall have the discretion and authority to amend the Plan at any time to satisfy any requirements of Section 409A of the Code or guidance
provided by the U.S. Treasury Department to the extent applicable to the Plan.    10.  Governing Law . The Plan shall be governed
by the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the extent not preempted by applicable federal law.

EXELON CORPORATION   
  SENIOR MANAGEMENT SEVERANCE PLAN   
  (As Amended and Restated)       

1. 
   PURPOSE OF THE PLAN        The Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan, as
amended and restated herein (the   Plan  ), is effective as of November 1, 2015 (the   Effective Date  ) except as otherwise specifically provided herein, and supersedes in its entirety all prior versions of the Plan
with respect to terminations of employment occurring any time on or after the Effective Date (or such other date as set forth herein). The Plan provides severance benefits to eligible executives of Exelon Corporation (  Exelon  ) and
its subsidiaries of which Exelon owns at least 80% of the outstanding voting power that are designated by the Plan Administrator as participating employers in the Plan (Exelon and such subsidiaries jointly and severally referred to as the
  Company  ) who submit a Notice of Termination or who are notified of their termination of employment on or after the Effective Date (or such other date as set forth herein), and to provide additional protection in the event of a
Change in Control of Exelon or an Imminent Control Change of Exelon.      

2. 
   ELIGIBILITY          

2.1. 
  Eligibility in General . Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 2.1, eligibility to participate in the Plan is limited to each employee of the Company whose position is in Salary Band E09 (or
equivalent executive grade) or above (an   Executive  ) who executes and returns to the Company by the later of 90 days after becoming an Executive, or 90 days after delivery thereof to the Executive, non-competition,
non-solicitation, confidential information and intellectual property covenants (  Restrictive Covenants  ) which are acceptable to Exelon and are either substantially in the form attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit I (as
may be modified from time to time by Exelon in its sole discretion) or set forth in another agreement between the Company and the Executive. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, eligibility for benefits under the Plan shall be
subject to the provisions of any agreement (including but not limited to an offer of employment or grant instrument) between an Executive and the Company providing that that such Executive would be ineligible for (or waives) all or a portion of the
benefits under the Plan or  change in control  benefits in the event of a termination of employment, or under which the Executive had agreed, prior to the Applicable Trigger Date, to terminate his or her employment.    

2.2. 
    Eligibility Under Section     4 . Subject to Section 2.1, each Executive shall be eligible for the benefits provided under
Section 4 hereof in the event such Executive has a Termination of Employment; provided, however, that any Executive whose Termination of Employment is covered under Section 5 hereof or a change in control agreement entered into between
such Executive and the Company (an   Individual Change in Control Agreement  ), or who is an interim employee separating under the change in control provisions of another severance

plan, shall not be eligible for benefits under Section 4, except as expressly provided in Section 5 or such Individual Change in Control Agreement (which expressly refers to the benefits under
Section 4 of this Plan).        

2.3. 
  Eligibility Under Section     5 . Eligibility for the benefits provided under Section 5 hereof due to a Termination of Employment during a Post-Change Period or an Imminent Control Change

Termination Date, a waiver and release of claims against the Company (  Waiver and Release  ) which is substantially in the form attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit II, as may from time to time be modified by the Company
in its sole discretion. An Executive s right to the payments and benefits under this Plan shall be contingent upon (a) Executive having timely executed and delivered to the Company the Severance Agreement, Waiver and Release and Restrictive
Covenants, (b) Executive not revoking the Waiver and Release and (c) Executive not violating any of Executive s on-going obligations under the Plan, the Waiver and Release and the Restrictive Covenants. To the extent that the Company makes
payments and provides benefits to an Executive prior to receipt of the Waiver and Release and/or the expiration of the revocation period and the Executive either does not timely execute and deliver the Waiver and Release to the Company or revokes
the Waiver and Release in accordance with its terms, Executive shall pay to the Company within 10 days following the expiration of the 45-day consideration period or the date such release was revoked, a lump sum payment of all payments and the value
of all benefits received by Executive to date hereunder.      
   A Participant described in Section 2.2 shall be entitled to all Accrued
Obligations and, subject to Section 6, benefits pursuant to this Section 4 upon the Participant s Termination of Employment.      

(a) 
    In General . Each Participant other than a Participant described in Section 4.1(b) shall receive severance pay at a monthly rate equal to 1/12

4.2. 
    Annual Incentive Awards . Each Participant who is a participant in the Annual Incentive Award Plan for the year in which the Termination
Date occurs shall receive an Annual Incentive which shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of such Annual Incentive by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during such year as of the Participant s Termination
Date and the number of days in the year in which Termination Date occurs. Payment of Annual Incentives under this Section 4.2 shall be made in a lump sum net of applicable taxes and other deductions at the time awards under the Annual Incentive
Award Plan are paid to active employees for such performance period (but not later than March 15 of the year following the last day of such performance period), and     
      3  

shall be considered a  short-term deferral  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. A Participant who is not a participant in the Annual Incentive Award Plan for the year in
which the Termination Date occurs shall not be entitled to an Annual Incentive, and the amount (if any) payable under any other Incentive Plan for such year shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion.    

4.3. 
  Stock Options . No Participant shall be entitled to participate in any new grants of Stock Options (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) made after such Participant s notification of his or her Termination of
Employment. Except as provided below, any Stock Options previously granted to the Participant shall be exercisable only to the extent such Stock Options are exercisable as of the date of such Participant s Termination Date and shall thereafter
be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the LTIP. Stock Options which remain unexercisable as of the Participant s Termination Date shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding, if, as of the last day of the Salary Continuation
Period, such Participant has attained at least age 50 ( age 55 with respect to Stock Options granted on or after January 1, 2013) and completed at least 10 years of service as defined under the tax-qualified defined benefit plan maintained by Exelon
in which the Executive is a participant (the   Pension Plan  ) or SERP, then any Stock Options granted to such Participant which have not become exercisable prior to the Participant s Termination Date shall (i) become fully
vested, and (ii) remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date or, if earlier, the option expiration date, provided that this Section 4.3 shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection
with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.        

4.4. 
  Other Awards . Awards of Performance Shares, Restricted Stock (as defined in Sections 5.1(c) and 5.1(d), respectively) and/or Cash Performance Awards, as applicable, shall be payable to a Participant solely
to the extent provided under the terms of such awards and the applicable plan under which such awards are granted; provided, however, that to the extent the Company determines that a Participant is a Specified Employee and that any such payment is
deferred compensation, each within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall not be made prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date or (ii) the date of the Participant s death.

4.5. 
    Health Care Coverage . During the Salary Continuation Period, a Participant (and his or her dependents) shall be eligible to participate in
the health care plans under which they were covered immediately prior to his or her Termination of Employment, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of such plans as in effect from time to time. The Participant s out of
pocket costs (including premiums, deductibles and co-payments) for such coverage shall be the same as that in effect from time to time for active peer employees during such period. Coverage under this Paragraph 4.5 shall be provided for the
duration of the Salary Continuation Period in lieu of continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 to 609 of ERISA (  COBRA  ) for the same period. At the end of the Salary Continuation Period, COBRA
continuation coverage may be elected for the remaining balance of the statutory coverage     
      4  

period, if any; provided, however that a Participant who, as of the last day of the Salary Continuation Period, has attained at least age 50 and completed at least 10 years of service (or who has
completed such other age and service requirement then in effect under the Exelon Corporation Severance Benefit Plan or any successor plan as of the relevant time set forth in such plan) under the terms of the Pension Plan (or who, pursuant to the
terms of an offer of employment or employment agreement or under any provision of the Pension Plan or SERP, is credited with a number of additional years of age and/or service that would enable such Participant to satisfy the above eligibility
requirements) shall be entitled to elect such Company group health care programs for retirees as are in effect as of the Termination Date and are applicable to such Participant by the programs  eligibility terms and conditions as though such
Participant had attained such programs  age and service requirements. The eligibility for coverage and availability of programs or plans, the amounts charged for coverage, and the other terms, conditions and limitations under the Company s
group health care programs or plans shall remain subject to the Company s right to amend, change or terminate such programs or plans at any time.        

4.6. 
  SERP / Other Deferred Compensation . For purposes of the Participant s SERP benefit, the Salary Continuation Period shall be taken into account as service solely for purposes of determining whether the
Participant is vested (i.e., 3 or 5 years of service) and, to the extent relevant under the Pension Plan covering the Participant, the amount of the Participant s regular accrued benefit, but not for purposes of determining eligibility for
early retirement benefits (including any social security supplement) or any other purpose. In determining the amount of the Participant s vested benefit, if any, the severance payments made under Section 4.1 shall be taken into account as
if such payments were normal base salary and incentive payments. Payment shall be made in accordance with the SERP and the Participant s distribution election in effect thereunder as of the Termination Date (or, if no affirmative election is in
effect as of such date, the default election applicable to the Participant). All amounts previously deferred by, or accrued to the benefit of, such Participant under the Exelon Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, the Exelon Corporation Stock
Deferral Plan or the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan shall, to the extent vested, be paid in accordance with the Participant s distribution election in effect thereunder as of the Termination Date (or,
if no affirmative election is in effect as of such date, the default election applicable to the Participant).        

4.7. 
  Life Insurance and Disability Coverage . A Participant shall be eligible for continued coverage under the applicable basic life insurance and long term disability plans sponsored by the Company (or other
equivalent coverage or benefits) shall be extended to each Participant through the last day of the Salary Continuation Period applicable to such Participant on the same terms and subject to the same terms and conditions as are applicable to active
peer employees (including, without limitation, submission of proof by an Executive who seeks long term disability benefits that such Executive would have satisfied the conditions for such benefits had the Executive been an employee during the Salary
Continuation Period and terminated employment on or before the last day of such period).    
      5  

4.8. 
  Executive Perquisites . Executive perquisites shall terminate effective as of the Participant s Termination Date, and any Company-owned property shall be required to be returned to the Company no later than
such date.        

4.9. 
  Outplacement and Financial Counseling Services . Each Participant shall be entitled to outplacement services at the expense of the Company for the twelve month period following the Termination Date, and
subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines are appropriate. No cash shall be paid in lieu of such fees and costs.    

4.10. 
  Restrictions on In-Kind Benefits . The in-kind benefits provided under each of Sections 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 during any calendar year shall not affect the benefits to be provided under such section in any subsequent
calendar year. The right to such benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit        

4.11. 
  Other Coverage . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Participant is eligible to obtain a specific type of coverage under welfare plan(s) sponsored by another employer of such Participant (e.g. medical,
prescription, vision, dental, disability, individual life insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits, but excluding for the purposes of this sentence retiree benefits if such Participant is so eligible), then the Company shall not be
obligated to provide any such specific type of coverage. The Participant shall promptly notify the Plan Administrator of any such coverage.

9. 
   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN        The Plan shall be administered on a day-to-day basis
by the Vice President, Corporate Compensation of Exelon (the   Plan Administrator  ). The Plan Administrator has the sole and absolute power and authority to interpret and apply the provisions of this Plan to a particular
circumstance, make all factual and legal determinations, construe uncertain or disputed terms and make eligibility and benefit determinations in such manner and to such extent as the Plan Administrator, in his or her sole discretion may determine.
Benefits under the Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator, in his or her discretion, determines that an individual is entitled to them; provided, however, that any dispute after the claims procedure under Section 10 has been exhausted
regarding whether an Executive s termination of employment for purposes of Section 5 is based on either Good Reason or Cause may, at the election of the Executive, be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 11.  
 The Plan Administrator may promulgate any rules and regulations it deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the Plan or to interpret the
terms and conditions of the Plan; provided, however, that no rule, regulation or interpretation shall be contrary to the provisions of the Plan. The rules, regulations and interpretations made by the Plan Administrator shall, where appropriate,
be applied on a consistent basis with respect to similarly situated Executives, and shall be final and binding on any Executive or former Executive and any successor in interest.  
 The Plan Administrator may delegate any administrative duties, including, without limitation, duties with respect to the processing, review,
investigation, approval and payment of severance pay and provision of severance benefits, to designated individuals or committees. The Plan Administrator may amend any Participant s Severance Agreement to the extent the Plan Administrator
determines it is reasonably necessary or appropriate to do so to comply with section 409A of the Code.  
      26  

The Plan Administrator shall determine the status of an
individual as an Executive and the eligibility and rights of any Executive or former Executive as a Participant to any severance pay or benefits hereunder. Any Executive or former Executive who believes that he or she is entitled to receive
severance pay or benefits under the Plan, including severance pay or benefits other than those initially determined by the Plan Administrator, may file a claim in writing with the Plan Administrator. Within 90 days after the receipt of the
claim the Plan Administrator shall either allow or deny the claim in writing, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days
after receipt of a request for review.    A claimant whose claim is denied (or his or her duly authorized representative) may, within 60
days after receipt of the denial of his or her claim, request a review upon written application to Exelon s Chief Human Resources Officer or other officer designated by Exelon and specified in the claim denial; review (without charge) relevant
documents; and submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim.    The Chief Human Resources Officer
or other designated officer shall notify the claimant of his or her decision on review within 60 days after receipt of a request for review unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall
be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of a request for review. Notice of the decision on review shall be in writing. The officer s decision on review shall be final and binding on any claimant or any
successor in interest.    In reviewing a claim or an appeal of a claim denial, the Plan Administrator and the Chief Human Resources Officer
or other designated by Exelon shall have all of the powers and authority granted to the Plan Administrator pursuant to Section 9.      
   Any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto
concerning whether an Executive s termination of employment for purposes of Section 5 is based on either Good Reason or Cause may, after the claims procedure under Section 10 has been exhausted and at the election of the Executive, be settled
by binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, before an impartial arbitrator pursuant to the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association (  AAA  ) pertaining to the arbitration of employee benefit plan 
 disputes. The costs and fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, regardless of the result of the arbitration. No arbitration shall be commenced after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings
based upon such subject matter would be barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Plan, any party may seek relief in the form of specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrator, and the Company may seek injunctive relief to enforce the above-referenced statutes of limitations.  

12. 
   AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN        Exelon s Chief Human Resources Officer or
another designated officer of the Company may amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time by written instrument; provided, however,  
      27  

that no amendment, modification or termination shall deprive any Participant of any payment or benefit that the Plan Administrator previously has determined is payable under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or termination that reduces the severance payments or materially adversely affects any Participant s other benefits under Section 5 shall become effective as to such Participant during: (a) the
24-month period following a Change Date or (b) during an Imminent Control Change Period (unless such Participant consents to such termination or amendment). Any purported Plan termination or amendment in violation of this Section 12 shall be void
and of no effect.      

13.1. 
  Limitation on Rights . Participation in the Plan is limited to the individuals described in Sections 2 and 3, and the benefits under the Plan shall not be payable with respect to any voluntary or
involuntary termination of employment that is not a Termination of Employment.        

13.2. 
  Cooperation By Participants . During the Salary Continuation Period or Severance Period, as applicable, the Executive shall (a) be reasonably available to the Company to respond to requests by them for
information pertaining to or relating to matters which may be within the knowledge of the Executive and (b) cooperate with the Company in connection with any existing or future litigation or other proceedings brought by or against the Company,
its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the extent the Company deems the Executive s cooperation reasonably necessary.        

13.3. 
  No Set-off by Company . This Section shall apply solely with respect to a Termination of Employment during a Post-Change Period or an Imminent Control Change Period that culminates in a Change Date. Except as
provided in Section 6, a Participant s right to receive when due the payments and other benefits provided for under Section 5 of this Plan is absolute, unconditional and subject to no setoff, counterclaim or legal or equitable defense.

13.4. 
  No Mitigation . A Participant shall not have any duty to mitigate the amounts payable by the Company under this Plan by seeking new employment following termination. Except as specifically otherwise provided in
this Plan, all amounts payable pursuant to this Plan shall be paid without reduction regardless of any amounts of salary, compensation or other amounts which may be paid or payable to the Executive as the result of the Executive s employment by
another, unaffiliated employer.        

13.5. 
  Headings . Headings of sections in this document are for convenience only, and do not constitute any part of the Plan.        

13.6. 
    Severability . If any one or more Sections, subsections or other portions of this Plan are declared by any court or governmental authority
to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any Section, subsection or other portion not so declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section, subsection or other portion so declared to be unlawful or
invalid shall be construed so as to effectuate the terms of such Section, subsection or other portion     
      28  

to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a determination is made that the Restrictive Covenants are invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part, then the Severance Agreement with respect to the Participant subject to such determination shall be void and the Company shall have no obligation to provide benefits under this Plan to such Participant.

13.7. 
  Governing Law . The Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and Section 409A of the Code.    

13.8. 
  No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Plan shall guarantee the right of a Participant to continue in employment, and the Company retains the right to terminate a Participant s employment at any
time for any reason or for no reason.        

13.9. 
  Successors and Assigns . This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Exelon and its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of a Participant and his or her legal
representatives, heirs and legatees. Exelon shall cause any successor to assume the Plan. No rights, obligations or liabilities of a Participant hereunder shall be assignable without the prior written consent of Exelon Corporation. In the event of
the death of a Participant prior to receipt of severance pay or benefits to which he or she is entitled hereunder (and, with respect to benefits under Section 4 or Section 5, after he or she has signed the Waiver and Release), the severance pay
described in Sections 4.1, 5.1, or 5.2, as applicable, shall be paid to his or her estate, and the Participant s dependents who are covered under any health care plans maintained by the Company shall be entitled to continued rights under
Section 4.5 or Section 5.1(e) or Section 5.2(g), as applicable; provided that the estate or other successor of the Participant has not revoked such Waiver and Release.    

13.10. 
  Notices . All notices and other communications under this Plan shall be in writing and delivered by hand, by nationally-recognized delivery service that promises overnight delivery, or by first-class
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:      If to a Participant, to such
Participant at his most recent home address on file with the Company.    If to the Company: to the Plan Administrator.  
 or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing. Notice and communications shall be effective when
actually received by the addressee.      

13.11. 
  Number and Gender . Wherever appropriate, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the masculine shall include the feminine.    

13.12. 
    Tax Withholding . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Plan or otherwise payable to a Participant or beneficiary any
Taxes the     
      29  

Company determines to be appropriate under applicable law and may report all such amounts payable to such authority in accordance with any applicable law or regulation.    

13.13. 
  Section 409A . This Plan shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of additional taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code ( 409A Penalties ). In the event the
terms of this Plan would subject a Participant to 409A Penalties, the Company may amend the terms of the Plan to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. The payments to a Participant pursuant to this Plan are intended to be exempt from
Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible, under either the separation pay exemption pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4), and for
purposes of the separation pay exemption, each installment paid to a Participant shall be considered a separate payment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, if on the date of a Participant s Termination Date the Participant is a
Specified Employee, then to the extent any amount payable under this Plan constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that under the terms of this Plan would be payable prior to the
six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date or (B) the date of the Participant s death. Any reimbursement (including any
advancement) payable to a Participant pursuant to this Plan shall be conditioned on the submission by the Participant of all expense reports reasonably required by the Company under any applicable expense reimbursement policy, and shall be paid to
the Participant within 30 days following receipt of such expense reports (or invoices), but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant incurred the reimbursable expense. Any amount
of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligibility for reimbursement during any other calendar year. The right to reimbursement pursuant to this Plan shall not be subject to liquidation or
exchange for any other benefit.

by the sum of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which become subject to outstanding options, outstanding Free-Standing SARs and outstanding Stock Awards granted under the Plan and shares of Common Stock delivered upon the settlement of
Performance Units granted under the Plan. To the extent that shares of Common Stock subject to an outstanding option, SAR or stock award granted under the Plan or any predecessor plan are not issued or delivered by reason of the expiration,
termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such award (excluding shares subject to an option cancelled upon settlement in shares of a related tandem SAR or shares subject to a tandem SAR cancelled upon exercise of a related option), then such shares
of Common Stock shall again be available under this Plan. Shares of Common Stock to be delivered under this Plan shall be made available from authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, or authorized and issued shares of Common Stock
reacquired and held as treasury shares or otherwise or a combination thereof.     1.6  Award Limits .   
 (a) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.7, no individual may be granted awards under the Plan during any calendar year that, in the
aggregate, may be settled by delivery of more than two million (2,000,000) shares of Common Stock. In addition, with respect to awards the value of which is based on the Fair Market Value of Common Stock and that may be settled in cash (in whole or
in part), no individual may be paid during any calendar year cash amounts relating to such awards that exceed the greater of the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock set forth in the preceding sentence either at the date of
grant or at the date of settlement. This Section 1.6(a) sets forth two separate limitations, so that awards that may be settled solely by delivery of Common Stock will not operate to reduce the amount or value of cash-only awards, and vice
versa; nevertheless, awards that may be settled in Common Stock or cash must not exceed either limitation.    (b) With respect to awards,
the value of which is not based on the Fair Market Value of Common Stock, no individual may receive during any calendar year cash or shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value at the date of settlement that, in the aggregate, exceeds five
million dollars ($5,000,000).    (c) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.7, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to

II. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS   
  2.1    Stock Options  . The Committee may, in its discretion, grant options to purchase shares of Common Stock to such eligible persons
as may be selected by the Committee. Each option, or portion thereof, that is not an Incentive Stock Option, shall be a Nonqualified Stock Option. Each option shall be granted within 10 years after the date on which this Plan is approved
by the Board. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of shares of Common Stock with respect to which options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a participant
during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan of the Company, or any parent or Subsidiary) exceeds the amount (currently $100,000) established by the Code, such options shall constitute Nonqualified Stock Options.  
 Options shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem advisable:    (a)  Number of Shares and Purchase Price . The number of shares
of Common Stock subject to an option and the purchase price per share of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the option shall be determined by the Committee;  provided ,  however , that the purchase price per share of Common Stock
purchasable upon exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option or an Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of such option;  provided   further , that if an
Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any person who, at the time such option is granted, owns capital stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of the Company (or of any parent or
Subsidiary) (a   Ten Percent Holder  ), the purchase price per share of Common Stock shall not be less than the price (currently 110% of Fair Market Value) required by the Code in order to constitute an Incentive Stock Option.  
 (b)  Option Period and Exercisability . The period during which an option may be exercised shall be determined by the Committee;
 provided ,  however , that no option shall be exercised later than 10 years after its date of grant;  provided   further , that if an Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to a Ten Percent Holder, such option shall not be
exercised later than five years after its date of grant. The Committee may, in its discretion, determine that an option is to be granted as a Performance Option and may establish an applicable Performance Period and Performance Measures which
shall be satisfied or met as a condition to the grant of such option or to the exercisability of all or a portion of such option. The Committee shall determine whether an option shall become exercisable in cumulative or non-cumulative
installments and in part or in full at any time. An exercisable option, or portion thereof, may be exercised only with respect to whole shares of Common Stock.  
 (c)  Method of Exercise . An option may be exercised (i) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of whole
shares of Common Stock to be purchased and accompanying such notice with payment therefor in full, and without any extension of credit, either (A) in cash, (B) by delivery (either actual delivery or by attestation procedures established by the
Company) to the Company of previously owned whole shares of Common Stock having a  
      9  

Fair Market Value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the aggregate purchase price payable by reason of such exercise, (C) authorizing the Company to withhold whole shares of Common
Stock which would otherwise be delivered having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date of exercise, equal to the amount necessary to satisfy such obligation, provided that the Committee determines that such withholding of shares
does not cause the Company to recognize an increased compensation expense under applicable accounting principles, (D)   except as may be prohibited by applicable law, in cash by a broker-dealer acceptable to the Company to whom the optionee has
submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise or (E) a combination of (A), (B) and (C), in each case to the extent set forth in the Agreement relating to the option, (ii) if applicable, by surrendering to the Company any Tandem SARs which are
cancelled by reason of the exercise of the option and (iii) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request. Any fraction of a share of Common Stock which would be required to pay such purchase price shall be disregarded and
the remaining amount due shall be paid in cash by the optionee. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued and no certificate representing Common Stock shall be delivered until the full purchase price therefor and any withholding taxes thereon,
as described in Section 5.5, have been paid.     2.2    Stock Appreciation Rights  . The Committee may, in its discretion, grant SARs to
such eligible persons as may be selected by the Committee. The Agreement relating to an SAR shall specify whether the SAR is a Tandem SAR or a Free-Standing SAR.  
 SARs shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the
terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem advisable:    (a)  Number of SARs and Base Price . The number of SARs subject to
an award shall be determined by the Committee. Any Tandem SAR related to an Incentive Stock Option shall be granted at the same time that such Incentive Stock Option is granted. The base price of a Tandem SAR shall be the purchase price
per share of Common Stock of the related option. The base price of a Free-Standing SAR shall be determined by the Committee;  provided ,  however , that such base price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share
of Common Stock on the date of grant of such SAR.    (b)  Exercise Period and Exercisability . The Agreement relating to an award
of SARs shall specify whether such award may be settled in shares of Common Stock (including shares of Restricted Stock) or cash or a combination thereof. The period for the exercise of an SAR shall be determined by the Committee;
 provided ,  however , that no SAR shall be exercised later than 10 years after its date of grant; and  provided ,  further , that no Tandem SAR shall be exercised later than the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture or other
termination of the related option. The Committee may, in its discretion, establish Performance Measures which shall be satisfied or met as a condition to the grant of an SAR or to the exercisability of all or a portion of an SAR. The
Committee shall determine whether an SAR may be exercised in cumulative or non-cumulative installments and in part or in full at any time. An exercisable SAR, or portion thereof, may be exercised, in the case of a Tandem SAR, only with respect
to whole shares of Common Stock and, in the case of a  Free-Standing  SAR, only with respect to a whole number of SARs. If an  
      10  

SAR is exercised for shares of Restricted Stock, a certificate or certificates representing such Restricted Stock shall be issued in accordance with Section 3.2(c), or such shares shall be
transferred to the holder in book entry form with restrictions on the Shares duly noted, and the holder of such Restricted Stock shall have such rights of a stockholder of the Company as determined pursuant to Section 3.2(d). Prior to the
exercise of an SAR for shares of Common Stock, including Restricted Stock, the holder of such SAR shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to such SAR.  
 (c)  Method of Exercise . A Tandem SAR may be exercised (i) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the number of whole
SARs which are being exercised, (ii) by surrendering to the Company any options which are cancelled by reason of the exercise of the Tandem SAR and (iii) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request. A Free-Standing SAR may
be exercised (A) by giving written notice to the Company specifying the whole number of SARs which are being exercised and (B) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request.

the expiration date of the term of such option or SAR.    (b)  Death . Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to an

holder s executor, administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person until and including the earlier to occur of (i) the date which is three years after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such option
or SAR.    (c)  Cause . If the Company ceases to employ the holder of an option or SAR due to a termination of employment by the

conduct giving rise to a termination for Cause, and the Company thereafter may require the repayment of any amounts received by such holder in connection with an exercise of such option or SAR following such cancellation date.  
 (d)  Other Termination . Subject to Sections 2.3(e), 2.3(f) and 2.3(g) below and unless otherwise specified in the Agreement

      11  

described in Section 2.3(a) through Section 2.3(c), then each option and SAR held by such holder shall be exercisable only to the extent that such option or SAR is exercisable on the effective
date of such holder s termination of employment, and may thereafter be exercised by such holder (or such holder s legal representative or similar person) until and including the earlier to occur of (i) the date which is 90 days after the
effective date of such holder s termination of employment and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such option or SAR.    (e)
 Death Following Termination of Employment . Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement relating to an option or SAR, as the case may be, if the holder of an option or SAR dies during the applicable post-termination exercise period described
in Section 2.3(d), each option and SAR held by such holder shall be exercisable only to the extent that such option or SAR, as the case may be, is exercisable on the date of such holder s death and may thereafter be exercised by the
holder s executor, administrator, legal representative, beneficiary or similar person until and including the earlier to occur of (i) the date which is one year after the date of death and (ii) the expiration date of the term of such option or
SAR.    (f)  Breach of Restrictive Covenant . Notwithstanding Sections 2.3(a) through (e), if the holder of an option or SAR
breaches his or her obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates under a noncompetition, nonsolicitation, confidentiality, intellectual property or other restrictive covenant (a   Restrictive Covenant  ), each option and SAR
held by such holder shall be cancelled and cease to be exercisable as of the date on which the holder first breached such Restrictive Covenant, and the Company thereafter may require the repayment of any amounts received by such holder in connection
with an exercise of such option or SAR following such cancellation date.    (g)  Certain Terminations After Change in
Control . Unless otherwise specified in, and subject to all conditions set forth in, the Agreement relating to an option or SAR, as the case may be, or any individual change in control agreement or severance plan, and notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 2.3, if within 24 months following a Change in Control, the Company ceases to employ the holder of an option or SAR due to a termination of employment (i) by the Company other than for Cause, or (ii) with respect to a
holder whose position is at least salary band E09 (or its equivalent), by the holder for Good Reason, such holder s outstanding options shall immediately become fully exercisable and may thereafter be exercised by such holder (or such
holder s legal representative or similar person) until and including the earlier to occur of (A) the date which is five years after the effective date of such holder s termination of employment and (B) the expiration date of the term of
such option or SAR.     2.4    No Repricing   .  The Committee shall not without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (i)
reduce the purchase price or base price of any previously granted option or SAR, (ii) cancel any previously granted option or SAR in exchange for another option or SAR with a lower purchase price or base price or (iii) cancel any previously granted
option or SAR in exchange for cash or another award if the purchase price of such option or the base price of such SAR exceeds the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of such cancellation, in each case, other than in connection

other taxes which may be required to be withheld or paid in connection with such award. An Agreement may provide that (i) the Company shall withhold whole shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be delivered to a holder, having an

security being (a) available under this Plan, such fractional security shall be disregarded, or (b) subject to an award under this Plan, the Company shall pay the holder of such award, in connection with the first vesting, exercise or settlement of
such award, in whole or in part, occurring after such adjustment, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of such security (rounded to the nearest hundredth) by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Fair Market Value on the

not breached his or her obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates under any Restrictive Covenant, then all Earned Shares subject to such Participant s Performance Share Unit Award and earned cash subject to a Performance Cash Unit
shall become fully vested as of the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment or date of death, as the case may be. To the extent the Award has not been earned as of the date of the Participant s termination of
employment or death (i.e. as to which the current Performance Cycle has not elapsed), the Participant shall become     
      5  

vested in a pro-rated Award based on the number of elapsed days in the current Performance Cycle as of the termination date (or fully vested with respect to such an Award for 2012 upon an
involuntary termination without Cause) and the extent to which the Company performance goals established under the Program for such Performance Cycle are attained as of the last day of the year in which the termination date occurs (and assuming a
100% individual performance multiplier), and such Award shall be payable as of the date the first third of the Awards for such Performance Cycle are payable to Participants who remain actively employed with the Company.

terminates by reason of Retirement, Disability, death or an involuntary termination of employment by the Company for a reason other than Cause, and such Participant has not breached his or her obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates
under any Restrictive Covenant, then (A) if such event occurs within the first 12 months of the Performance Cycle, then the Participant shall earn and become vested in a pro-rated Award (both First and Second Tranches, in the case of Bridge Awards)
based on the number of elapsed days in such 12-month period as of the termination date (pro-ration determined by dividing the number of elapsed days by 365) and the extent to which the performance goals established under the Program for such
Performance Cycle (or portion thereof, in the case of the Transition Awards) are attained, and (B) if such event occurs after the first 12 months of the Performance Cycle, then the Participant shall become fully vested in all Earned Shares (the
number determined in accordance with Section 3(b) above) or earned cash, as applicable. In either event, the Earned Shares or cash shall be payable on the next payout date applicable to Participants who remain actively employed with the Company
(either the payout date for the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as applicable, in the case of Transition Awards).        

(iii) 
  Termination for Other Reasons . If a Participant s employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than as described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 3(f) or if the Participant has breached
his or her obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates under any Restrictive Covenant, the unvested portion of such Participant s Award shall be forfeited and terminate as of the date of such termination of employment.
     (g)  Restriction on Sale of Shares by Senior Officers . Shares of Common Stock issued under an
Award pursuant to Section 3(e) to a Participant who is employed as of the Grant Date in a position of, or more senior than, Senior Vice President may not be sold or transferred by such Participant until the earlier to occur of (i) the date as
of which the final third of such Award is scheduled to become vested pursuant to Section 3(c) (even if such Award actually vests earlier pursuant to Section 3(f)) or (ii) the date of the Participant s death, regardless of when such shares are

that may be subject to a Performance Share Unit Award, as set forth in Section 3(b), and (ii) such Performance Share Unit Awards for 2011 shall be settled (subject to the vesting and other conditions herein) in a cash payment made by ComEd to the

      7  

(e)  Dividend Equivalents . As of each Dividend Payment Date, the
number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be increased by (i) the product of the total number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to such Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
record date for such Dividend Payment Date, but that have not been issued pursuant to Section 4(f) as of such record date, multiplied by the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Common Stock, divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of
a share of Common Stock on such Dividend Payment Date. Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Award, including the vesting conditions set forth in Section 4(d).  
 (f)  Settlement of Vested Awards . Subject to the withholding of taxes pursuant to Section 8 of the Program, within
30 days after the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, in whole or in part (or at such later time as may be required pursuant to this Section 4(f)), the Company shall issue or transfer to the Participant the number of shares of Common Stock

of employment or date of death, as the case may be.

    Termination for Other Reasons . If a Participant s employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than as described in clause

      8  

unvested portion of such Participant s Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be forfeited and terminate as of the date of such termination of employment; provided however, that such an Award
granted on or after January 1, 2012 shall become fully vested upon an involuntary termination without Cause.      5.  Stock

acceptable to the Company to whom the Participant has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise or (E) a combination of (A), (B) and (C) and (ii) by executing such documents as the Company may reasonably request. Any fraction of a share of

covenants that (a) any share of Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of the Award will be acquired for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities

Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and such state securities laws; and (c) if requested by the Company, the Participant shall submit a written statement, in
form satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such representation (x) is true and correct as of the date of acquisition of any shares hereunder or (y) is true and correct as of the date of any sale of any such shares, as applicable. As a

the shares and, in connection therewith, shall execute any documents which the Company shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable.

deemed to be received on the next succeeding business day of the Company.  
      13  

(c)  Section 409A . This Program and the Awards granted hereunder are
intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with such intent. Awards granted pursuant to this Program are also intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to
the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4), and for this purpose each payment shall be considered a separate payment. In the event the terms of an Award would subject a Participant to
taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code (  409A Penalties  ), the Company may modify the terms of such Award to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible; provided that in no event shall the Company be responsible
for any 409A Penalties that arise in connection with any Award. To the extent the timing of payment under an Award is determined by reference to a Participant s  termination of employment,  such term shall be deemed to refer to the
Participant s  separation from service,  within the meaning of section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Program, if a Participant is a  specified employee,  as defined in Section 409A of the
Code, as of the date of such Participant s separation from service, then to the extent any amount payable to the Participant (i) constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (ii)
is payable upon the Participant s separation from service and (iii) under the terms of this Program would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the Participant s separation from service, such payment shall be delayed until the
earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the separation from service and (B) the date of the Participant s death.

the Committee.    (e)  Governing Law . This Program and each Award granted thereunder, and all determinations made and
actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and construed in accordance therewith without giving effect to principles of conflicts of

year following the calendar in which the Grant Date occurs with respect to an additional one-third of the number of Earned Shares, and (iii) on the date of the first regular meeting of the Committee held in the third calendar year following the

      4  

(d)  Dividend Equivalents . As of each Dividend Payment Date, the
Company shall pay to the Participant a cash payment in an amount equal to the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of Earned Shares (if any) that are subject to a Performance Share Unit Award
immediately prior to the record date for such Dividend Payment Date, but that have not been issued pursuant to Section 3(e) as of such record date.  
 (e)  Settlement of Vested Awards . Subject to the withholding of taxes pursuant to Section 8 of the Program, within
30 days after the vesting of a Performance Share Unit Award, in whole or in part (or at such later time as may be required pursuant to this Section 3(e)), the Company shall issue or transfer to the Participant the number of Earned Shares that have
become vested. The Company may effect such transfer either by the delivery of one or more certificates of Common Stock to the Participant or by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the
Company, and in either case by issuing such shares in the Participant s name or in such other name as is acceptable to the Company and designated in writing by the Participant. All such Awards payable for 2012 or thereafter shall be paid 50% in
Common Stock and 50% in cash; provided, however, that effective for Awards granted on or after January 1, 2013 (including Transition Awards), a Participant whose title is Executive Vice President or above and who has achieved 200% or more of his or
her stock ownership target by September 30 of the calendar year prior to payout of the Award shall be paid in cash. The Company shall pay all original issue or transfer taxes and all fees and expenses incident to such delivery, except as otherwise

a Participant s employment with the Company terminates by reason of Retirement, Disability, death or an involuntary termination of employment by the Company for a reason other than Cause, and such Participant has not breached his or her
obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates under any Restrictive Covenant, then all Earned Shares subject to such Participant s     
      5  

Performance Share Unit Award and earned cash subject to a Performance Cash Unit shall become fully vested as of the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment or date of
death, as the case may be. To the extent the Award has not been earned as of the date of the Participant s termination of employment or death (i.e. as to which the current Performance Cycle has not elapsed), the Participant shall become vested
in a pro-rated Award based on the number of elapsed days in the current Performance Cycle as of the termination date (or fully vested with respect to such an Award for 2012 upon an involuntary termination without Cause) and the extent to which the
Company performance goals established under the Program for such Performance Cycle are attained as of the last day of the year in which the termination date occurs (and assuming a 100% individual performance multiplier), and such Award shall be
payable as of the date the first third of the Awards for such Performance Cycle are payable to Participants who remain actively employed with the Company.        

(ii)

terminates by reason of Retirement, Disability, death or an involuntary termination of employment by the Company for a reason other than Cause, and such Participant has not breached his or her obligations to the Company or any of its affiliates
under any Restrictive Covenant, then (A) if such event occurs within the first 12 months of the Performance Cycle, then the Participant shall earn and become vested in a pro-rated Award (both First and Second Tranches, in the case of Bridge Awards)
based on the number of elapsed days in such 12-month period as of the termination date (pro-ration determined by dividing the number of elapsed days by 365) and the extent to which the performance goals established under the Program for such
Performance Cycle (or portion thereof, in the case of the Transition Awards) are attained, and (B) if such event occurs after the first 12 months of the Performance Cycle, then the Participant shall become fully vested in all Earned Shares (the
number determined in accordance with Section 3(b) above) or earned cash, as applicable. In either event, the Earned Shares or cash shall be payable on the next payout date applicable to Participants who remain actively employed with the Company
(either the payout date for the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as applicable, in the case of Transition Awards).        

(iii) 
  Termination for Other Reasons . If a Participant s employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than as described in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 3(f) or if the Participant has breached

granted to Participants who are employed by Commonwealth Edison Company, an Illinois corporation and subsidiary of the Company (  ComEd  ), then unless the Committee determines otherwise, (i) the number of such Participant s
Earned Shares shall be determined based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Board of Directors of ComEd and ratified by the Committee, subject to the maximum number of Earned Shares that may be subject to a Performance
Share Unit Award, as set forth in Section 3(b), and (ii) such Performance Share Unit Awards for 2011 shall be settled (subject to the vesting and other conditions herein) in a cash payment made by ComEd to the Participant in an amount equal to the

the Committee. The decision of the Committee regarding any such adjustment, Change in Control and/or Corporate Transaction shall be final, binding and conclusive.  
 10.  Compliance with Applicable Law . Each Award is subject to the condition that if the listing, registration or qualification of
the shares subject to such Award upon any securities exchange or under any law, or the consent or approval of any governmental body, or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the delivery

implementing applicable stock exchange listing standards or rules and regulations thereunder, or as otherwise required by law or regulation.  
      12  

12.  Investment Representation . By accepting an Award, the Participant represents and
covenants that (a) any share of Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of the Award will be acquired for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities
Act  ), unless such acquisition has been registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities law; (b) any subsequent sale of any such shares shall be made either pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and such state securities laws; and (c) if requested by the Company, the Participant shall submit a written statement, in
form satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such representation (x) is true and correct as of the date of acquisition of any shares hereunder or (y) is true and correct as of the date of any sale of any such shares, as applicable. As a
further condition precedent to the delivery to the Participant of any shares subject to the Award, the Participant shall comply with all regulations and requirements of any regulatory authority having control of or supervision over the issuance of
the shares and, in connection therewith, shall execute any documents which the Company shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable.  
 13.  Award Confers No Rights to Continued Employment . In no event shall the granting of an Award or its acceptance by a Participant
give or be deemed to give the Participant any right to continued employment by the Company.    14.  Administrator . This Program shall
be administered by the Company s Vice President, Corporate Compensation (the  Administrator ). Except for authority reserved to the Board or the Committee, the Administrator shall have the right to interpret the Program, make any
determinations hereunder, and take any necessary or appropriate actions with respect to the administration of the Program or in connection with each Award. Any such interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the regarding this
Program or an Award shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Administrator may adopt such rules and procedures as it deems appropriate for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to rules and procedures governing the
administration and treatment (e.g., pro-ration, vesting, etc.) of Awards to Participants in situations involving transfers between business units and eligible and ineligible positions, which may be set forth in the applicable Program summary or
Award Notice.    15.  Miscellaneous Provisions .  
 (a)  Successors . This Program and each Award shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor or
successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall, upon the death of a Participant, acquire any rights under such Award in accordance with this Program or the Plan.  
 (b)  Notices . All notices, requests or other communications provided for in this Program (other than the exercise of
a stock option) shall be made, if to the Company, to Exelon Corporation, 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attention: Vice President, Corporate Compensation, and if to the Participant, to his or her then current work
location. All notices, requests or other communications provided for in this Program shall be made in writing either (a) by personal delivery to the party entitled thereto, (b) by facsimile with confirmation of receipt, (c) by mailing in the
United States mails to the last  
      13  

known address of the party entitled thereto or (d) by express courier service. The notice, request or other communication shall be deemed to be received upon personal delivery, upon
confirmation of receipt of facsimile transmission, or upon receipt by the party entitled thereto if by United States mail or express courier service; provided, however, that if a notice, request or other communication is not received during regular
business hours, it shall be deemed to be received on the next succeeding business day of the Company.    (c)  Section
409A . This Program and the Awards granted hereunder are intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with such intent. Awards granted pursuant to this Program are also
intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4), and for this purpose each payment shall be considered a separate payment. In the event
the terms of an Award would subject a Participant to taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code (  409A Penalties  ), the Company may modify the terms of such Award to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible; provided
that in no event shall the Company be responsible for any 409A Penalties that arise in connection with any Award. To the extent the timing of payment under an Award is determined by reference to a Participant s  termination of
employment,  such term shall be deemed to refer to the Participant s  separation from service,  within the meaning of section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Program, if a Participant is a
 specified employee,  as defined in Section 409A of the Code, as of the date of such Participant s separation from service, then to the extent any amount payable to the Participant (i) constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred
compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (ii) is payable upon the Participant s separation from service and (iii) under the terms of this Program would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the Participant s
separation from service, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the separation from service and (B) the date of the Participant s death.  
 (d)  Amendment . The terms of this Program may be amended by the Committee or the Board (or their respective
delegates), provided that the Chief Human Resources Officer or the Vice President, Corporate Compensation, of the Company may amend the Program to comply with applicable law, to make administrative changes or to carry out directives of the Board or
the Committee.    (e)  Governing Law . This Program and each Award granted thereunder, and all determinations made and
actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and construed in accordance therewith without giving effect to principles of conflicts of
laws.
