PART I          

ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS                  General              Corporate Structure and Business and Other Information             Exelon, incorporated in Pennsylvania in February 1999, is a utility services holding company engaged, through Generation, in the energy generation business, and through ComEd, PECO and BGE, in the energy delivery
businesses discussed below. Exelon s principal executive offices are located at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, and its telephone number is 312-394-7398.   
         Generation    
        Generation s integrated business consists of its owned and
contracted electric generating facilities and investments in generation ventures that are marketed through its leading customer-facing activities. These customer-facing activities include, wholesale energy marketing operations and its competitive
retail customer supply of electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products, risk management services and natural gas exploration and production activities. Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the
Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Regions.            Generation was formed in 2000 as a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Generation began operations as a result of a corporate restructuring, effective January 1, 2001, in which Exelon separated its
generation and other competitive businesses from its regulated energy delivery businesses at ComEd and PECO. Generation s principal executive offices are located at 300 Exelon Way, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania 19348, and its telephone number is
610-765-5959.             ComEd    
        ComEd s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and
regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to retail customers in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.   
        ComEd was organized in the State of Illinois in 1913 as a result of the
merger of Cosmopolitan Electric Company into the original corporation named Commonwealth Edison Company, which was incorporated in 1907. ComEd s principal executive offices are located at 440 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60605, and
its telephone number is 312-394-4321.             PECO
            PECO s energy delivery business consists of the
purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to retail customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of
natural gas and the provision of natural gas distribution services to retail customers in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.         
  PECO was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. PECO s principal executive offices are located at 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
19103, and its telephone number is 215-841-4000.             BGE
            BGE s energy delivery business consists of the
purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to retail customers in central Maryland,   
         6   

including the City of Baltimore, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of gas distribution services to retail customers in central Maryland, including
the City of Baltimore.            BGE was incorporated in Maryland in
1906. BGE s principal executive offices are located at 110 West Fayette Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, and its telephone number is 410-234-5000.         
   Operating Segments          
  See Note 24 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Exelon s operating segments.   
         Merger with Constellation Energy Group, Inc.    
        On March 12, 2012, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by
the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Bolt Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub), and Constellation. As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into Constellation (the Initial Merger) and Constellation became
a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. Following the completion of the Initial Merger, Exelon and Constellation completed a series of internal corporate organizational restructuring transactions. Constellation merged with and into Exelon, with Exelon
continuing as the surviving corporation (the Upstream Merger). Simultaneously with the Upstream Merger, Constellation s interest in RF HoldCo LLC, which holds Constellation s interest in BGE, was transferred to Exelon Energy Delivery
Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon that also owns Exelon s interests in ComEd and PECO. Following the Upstream Merger and the transfer of RF HoldCo LLC, Exelon contributed to Generation certain subsidiaries, including those with
generation and customer supply operations that were acquired from Constellation as a result of the Initial Merger and the Upstream Merger. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
Constellation transaction.               Generation
            Generation, one of the largest competitive electric
generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Generation operates in well-developed
energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source
diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets. Generation operates as an integrated business, leveraging its owned and contracted electric generation capacity to market and sell
power to wholesale and retail customers. Generation s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets.
Generation also sells natural gas and renewable energy and other energy-related products and services, and engages in natural gas exploration and production activities.   
        Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is
subject to FERC s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for
sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including Generation, which is a
public utility as FERC defines that term) and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to,
third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of   
         7   

another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate
reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Additionally, ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets
regulated by FERC. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally,
Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of FERC.         
  RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. PJM, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP, have
been approved by FERC as RTOs, and CAISO and ISO-NY have been approved as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability,
market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service
across several transmission systems.             Significant Acquisitions
              Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One   . 
On September 30, 2011, Exelon announced the completion of its acquisition of all of the interests in Antelope Valley, a 230-MW solar photovoltaic (PV) project under development in northern Los Angeles County, California, from First Solar, Inc.,
which is developing, building, operating, and maintaining the project. The first portion of the project began operations in December 2012, with six additional blocks coming online in 2013. Exelon has been informed by First Solar of issues relating
to delays in the certification of certain components relating to the final two blocks of the project, which will delay commercial operation of these two blocks until the first half of 2014. The delay will not have a material financial effect on
Exelon. Exelon expects the project to be in full commercial operation in the first half of 2014. The acquisition supports the Exelon commitment to renewable energy as part of Exelon 2020. The project has a 25-year PPA, approved by the CPUC, with
Pacific Gas   Electric Company for the full output of the plant. Upon completion, the facility will add 230 MWs to Generation s renewable generation fleet. Total capitalized costs for the facility are expected to be approximately $1.1
billion. Total capitalized costs incurred through December 31, 2013 were approximately $968 million.         
    Wolf Hollow Generating Station.   On August 24, 2011, Generation completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of
Wolf Hollow, LLC (Wolf Hollow), a combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plant in north Texas, for a purchase price of $311 million which increased Generation s owned capacity within the ERCOT power market by 720 MWs.   
        See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on the above acquisitions.             Significant
Dispositions               Maryland Clean Coal
Stations.   On November 30, 2012, a subsidiary of Generation sold the Brandon Shores generating station and H.A. Wagner generating station in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the C.P. Crane generating station in Baltimore County,
Maryland to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Riverstone Holdings LLC to comply with certain of the regulatory approvals required by the merger, for net proceeds of approximately $371 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $272
million. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         8   

Generating Resources     
        At December 31, 2013, the generating resources of Generation
consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  See  Fuel  for sources of fuels used in electric generation.     

(b)  
  Includes equity method investment in certain generating facilities.     

(c)  
  Excludes contracts with CENG. See Long-Term Power Purchase Contracts table in this section for additional information.     

(d)  
  Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Generation and Note 25 Related Party Transactions of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.              Generation has six reportable segments, the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Regions, representing the different geographical areas in which Generation s customer-facing activities
are conducted and where Generation s generating resources are located.         

Mid-Atlantic represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District
of Columbia and parts of North Carolina (approximately 37% of capacity).            

Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee; and the United
States footprint of MISO excluding MISO s Southern Region, which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not covered by PJM; and
parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky (approximately 34% of capacity).            

New England represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont
(approximately 8% of capacity).            

New York represents the operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety (approximately 3% of capacity).

ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas (approximately 12% of capacity).

Other Regions is an aggregate of regions not considered individually significant (approximately 6% of capacity).      
          Nuclear Facilities     
        Generation has ownership interests in eleven nuclear generating
stations currently in service, consisting of 19 units with an aggregate of 17,263 MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75% ownership), Peach Bottom Generating
Station (50% ownership) and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated on Exelon s financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit. Generation s nuclear generating
stations are all operated by   
         9   

Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2013 and 2012, electric supply
(in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 57% and 53%, respectively, of Generation s total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. The
majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion
of Generation s electric supply sources.              Constellation Energy
Nuclear Group, Inc.              Generation also owns a 50.01%
interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. CENG is governed by a board of ten directors, five of which are appointed by Generation and five by EDF. CENG owns and operates a total of five nuclear generating facilities on three sites, Calvert
Cliffs, Ginna and Nine Mile Point. CENG s ownership share in the total capacity of these units is 3,998 MW. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information on these sites.            On July 29, 2013, Exelon, Generation and subsidiaries of Generation entered into a Master Agreement with EDF, EDF
Inc. (EDFI) (a subsidiary of EDF) and CENG. The Master Agreement contemplates that the parties will execute a series of additional agreements at a closing that will occur following the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions. Exelon currently expects that the closing will occur early in the second quarter of 2014.         
  At the closing, Generation, CENG and subsidiaries of CENG will execute a Nuclear Operating Services Agreement pursuant to which Generation will
operate the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries and provide corporate and administrative services for the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to EDFI s
rights as a member of CENG. CENG will reimburse Generation for its direct and allocated costs for such services. The Nuclear Operating Services Agreement will replace the SSA. At the closing, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, a subsidiary of CENG,
will also assign to Generation its obligations as Operator of Nine Mile Point Unit 2 under an operating agreement with the co-owner. In addition, at the closing the PSAA will be amended and extended until the complete and permanent cessation of
operation of the CENG generation plants.            At closing,
Generation will make a $400 million loan to CENG bearing interest at 5.25% per annum, payable out of specified available cash flows of CENG and, in any event, payable upon settlement of the Put Option Agreement discussed below, if the put
option is exercised, or payable upon the maturity date of the note (which will be 20 years from the closing), whichever occurs first. Immediately following receipt of the proceeds of such loan, CENG will make a $400 million special distribution to
EDFI. The parties will also execute a Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for CENG, pursuant to which, among other things, CENG will commit to make preferred distributions to Generation (after repayment of the $400 million loan)
quarterly out of specified available cash flows, until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.5% per annum from the date of the special distribution to EDFI.   
        Generation and EDFI will also enter into a Put Option Agreement at
closing pursuant to which EDFI will have the option, exercisable beginning in 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of the parties, or
absent agreement, a third party arbitration process. The appraisers determining fair market value of EDF s 49.99% interest in CENG under the Put Option Agreement are instructed to take into account all rights and obligations under the CENG
Operating Agreement, including Generation s rights with respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return, and the value of Generation s rights to other distributions. The beginning of the exercise period will
be accelerated if   
         10   

Exelon s affiliates cease to own a majority of CENG and exercise a related right to terminate the Nuclear Operating Services Agreement. In addition, under limited circumstances, the period
for exercise of the put option may be extended for 18 months.         
  Generation will execute an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation will indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third party claims that
may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon will guarantee Generation s obligations under this indemnity.   
        CENG owns 100% of four nuclear units in Maryland and New York and 82%
of Nine Mile Point Unit 2 in New York. Generation currently has an agreement under which it is purchasing 85% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG that is not sold to third parties under pre-existing firm and unit contingent PPAs through 2014.
Beginning on January 1, 2015 and continuing to the end of the life of the respective plants, Generation will purchase on a unit contingent basis 50.01% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG, and EDF will purchase on a unit contingent basis
49.99% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG (EDF PPA). This agreement will continue to be effective and is not affected by the Master Agreement, except that if the put option under the Master Agreement is exercised, then the EDF PPA would
transfer to Generation upon the completion of the Put Option Agreement transaction.            Currently, Exelon and Generation account for its investment in CENG under the equity method of accounting. The transfer of the operational control to Exelon and Generation will result in Exelon and Generation being
required to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of CENG. When that accounting change occurs, Exelon and Generation will derecognize its equity method investment in CENG and will record all assets, liabilities and the
non-controlling interest in CENG at fair value on Exelon and Generation s balance sheets. Any difference between the former carrying value and newly recorded fair value at that date will be recognized as a gain or loss upon consolidation, which
could be material to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations. See Note 5 Investment in CENG of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding CENG.   
          Nuclear Operations.   Capacity factors, which are
significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States, Generation can
negotiate favorable terms for the materials and services that its business requires. Generation s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history.   
        During 2013 and 2012, the nuclear generating facilities operated by
Generation achieved capacity factors of 94.1% and 92.7%, respectively. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for
Generation s wholesale and retail marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe,
reliable operations.            In addition to the rigorous
maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety
systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident.         
    Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation.   Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its
nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and
environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously   
         11   

assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results, and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2013, the NRC categorized Dresden units 2 and 3,
LaSalle unit 2, and Clinton in the Regulatory Response Column, which is the second highest of five performance bands. All other units operated by Generation are categorized in the Licensee Response Column as of December 31, 2013, which is the
highest performance band. On January 1, 2014, Dresden units 2 and 3 returned to the Licensee Response Column. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act,
the regulations under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities and/or increased operating costs of nuclear
generating units.            On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced
a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the
Fukushima Daiichi events issued a report of its review of the accident, including recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The Task Force s report concluded that nuclear reactors in the
United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The NRC and its staff have issued orders and implementation guidance for commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States. The NRC and its
staff are continuing to evaluate additional requirements. For additional information on the NRC actions related to the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the industry s response, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview.              Licenses   .  Generation has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3, Dresden Units
2 and 3, Quad Cities Units 1 and 2, Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island Unit 1. Additionally, PSEG has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. On December 8, 2010,
Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for Generation s nuclear facilities in
service:         
 
         12   

(a)  
  Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.     

(b)  
  On May 29, 2013, Generation submitted applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of Braidwood Units 1 and 2 and Byron Units 1 and 2 by 20 years.

(c)  
  Stations for which the NRC has issued a renewed operating licenses.     

(d)  
  In June 2011, Generation submitted applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of Limerick Units 1 and 2 by 20 years.     

(e)  
  In December 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.     
        Generation expects to apply for and obtain approval of license renewals
for the remaining nuclear units. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review. The NRC review process takes approximately two
years from the docketing of an application. Each requested license renewal is expected to be for 20 years beyond the original license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the
actual and assumed renewal of operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek.         
  In August 2012, Generation entered into an operating services agreement with the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to provide operational and
managerial support services for the Fort Calhoun Station and a licensing agreement for use of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model. The terms for both agreements are 20 years. OPPD will continue to own the plant and remain the NRC licensee.
             Nuclear Uprate Program.   Generation is engaged
in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear fleet. When economically viable, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and application of expertise gained from a
half-century of nuclear power operations. Based on ongoing reviews, the nuclear uprate implementation plan was adjusted during 2013 to cancel certain projects. The Measurement Uncertainty Recapture uprate projects at the Dresden and Quad Cities
nuclear stations were cancelled as a result of the cost of additional plant modifications identified during final design work which, when combined with then current market conditions, made the projects not economically viable. Additionally, the
market conditions prompted Generation to cancel the previously deferred extended power uprate projects at the LaSalle and Limerick nuclear stations. During 2013, Generation recorded a pre-tax charge to operating and maintenance expense and interest
expense of approximately $111 million and $8 million, respectively, to accrue remaining costs and reverse the previously capitalized costs.         
  Under the nuclear uprate program, Generation has placed into service projects representing 316 MWs of new nuclear generation at a cost of $952
million, which has been capitalized to property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2013, Generation has capitalized $203 million to construction work in progress within
property, plant and equipment for nuclear uprate projects expected to be placed in service by the end of 2016, consisting of 200 MWs of new nuclear generation, that are in the installation phase across four nuclear stations; Peach Bottom in
Pennsylvania and Byron, Braidwood and Dresden in Illinois. The remaining spend associated with these projects is expected to be approximately $300 million through the end of 2016. Generation believes that it is probable that these projects will be
completed. If a project is expected not to be completed as planned, previously capitalized costs will be reversed through earnings as a charge to operating and maintenance expense and interest.   
          Nuclear Waste Disposal.   There are no facilities for the
reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools or in
dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations.   
         13   

As of December 31, 2013, Generation had approximately 59,900 SNF assemblies (14,400 tons) stored
on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party; see Note 15 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage, except for Clinton and Three Mile Island.
Clinton and Three Mile Island will currently lose full core reserve, which is when the on-site storage pool will no longer have sufficient space to receive a full complement of fuel from the reactor core, in 2015 and 2023, respectively. Dry cask
storage will be in operation at Clinton and is expected to be in operation at Three Mile Island prior to the closing of their respective on-site storage pools. On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting
all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning.         
  For a discussion of matters associated with Generation s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 22 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.            As a by-product of their
operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter
into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an
operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020.            Generation is currently utilizing on-site storage capacity at its nuclear generation stations for limited amounts of LLRW and has been shipping its Class A LLRW, which represent 93% of LLRW generated at its
stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Oyster Creek and Salem), and Connecticut.
Generation has received NRC approval for its Peach Bottom and LaSalle stations that will allow storage at these sites of LLRW from its remaining stations with limited capacity. Generation now has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C
LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation s nuclear fleet. During 2012, Generation entered into a six year contract to ship Class B and Class C LLRW to Texas. The terms of the agreement will provide for disposal of all current Class B and
Class C LLRW stored at the stations, as well as the waste generated during the term of the agreement. Although Texas started accepting waste for disposal in 2012, the Texas site is curie limited (3.9 million curies for 15 years). With this limit,
the annual facility volume will not match industry production of activated hardware, and on-site storage is expected to be required for the Generation boiling water reactors. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW,
including an LLRW reduction program to minimize cost impacts and on-site storage.              Nuclear Insurance.   Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation
has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See  Nuclear Insurance  within Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.   
        For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on
Exelon s and Generation s financial condition and results of operations.   
         14   

Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities
demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset
Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Notes 3, 11 and 15 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation s NDT funds and its decommissioning
obligations.            Dresden Unit 1 and Peach Bottom Unit 1 have
ceased power generation. SNF at Dresden Unit 1 is currently being stored in dry cask storage until a permanent repository under the NWPA is completed. All SNF for Peach Bottom Unit 1, which ceased operation in 1974, has been removed from the site
and the SNF pool is drained and decontaminated. Generation s estimated ARO liability to decommission Dresden Unit 1 and Peach Bottom Unit 1 as of December 31, 2013 was $208 million and $114 million, respectively. As of December 31,
2013, NDT funds set aside to pay for these obligations were $436 million.             Zion Station Decommissioning.  On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC
(EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998.   
        On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the
transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for
Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request
reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if
certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. See Note 15 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding Zion Station Decommissioning and see Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of variable interest entity considerations related to ZionSolutions.   
          Fossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric)     
        Generation has ownership interests in 15,875 MW of capacity in fossil
and renewable generating facilities currently in service. Generation wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) jointly owned facilities that include Keystone, Conemaugh, and Wyman;
(2) ownership interests through equity method investments in Colver, Malacha, Safe Harbor, and Sunnyside; and (3) certain wind project entities with minority interest owners, see Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on these wind project entities. Generation s fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of Colver, Conemaugh, Keystone, LaPorte, Malacha, Safe Harbor,
Sunnyside and Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2013 and 2012, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 15% and 12%, respectively, of Generation s total electric supply. The
majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation s wholesale and retail power   
         15   

marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generation s electric generating facilities, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Generation and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview for additional information on Generation Renewable Development.   
          Licenses.   Fossil and renewable generation plants are
generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or
connected to the interstate electric grid. On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for 46-year licenses for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Project and the Conowingo
Hydroelectric Project, respectively. Based on the latest FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process is not expected to be completed prior to the expiration of Muddy Run s current license on August 31, 2014, and the expiration of
Conowingo s license on September 1, 2014. However, the stations will continue to operate under annual licenses until FERC takes action on the 46-year license applications. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.
             Insurance.   Generation maintains business
interruption insurance for its renewable projects, and delay in start-up insurance for its renewable projects currently under construction. Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance for its wholly owned fossil and hydroelectric
operations. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount
of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Generation.              Long-Term Power Purchase Contracts
             In addition to energy produced by owned generation
assets, Generation sources electricity and other related output from plants it does not own under long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original
term in excess of one year in duration, by region, in effect as of December 31, 2013:         

(a)  
  Excludes contracts with CENG.     
         16   

Fuel           
  The following table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for 2013 and 2012:   

(a)  
  Represents Generation s proportionate share of the output of its generating plants.     

(b)  
  Includes purchases pursuant to Generation s PPA with CENG. See Note 25 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
             The fuel costs for nuclear generation are
less than those for fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale and retail load servicing requirements.   
        The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the
mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate
inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through 2016. Generation s contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2020. All of
Generation s enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2018. Contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2018. Generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion,
enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units.            Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the
event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing.         
  Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price
risk, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
and Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.         
    Power Marketing           
  Generation s integrated business operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and
through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership of generation assets and power purchase and lease agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional
generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs are commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership depending on the type of underlying asset. Generation secures
contracted generation as part of its overall strategic   
         17   

plan, with objectives such as obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers and assisting customers to meet renewable
portfolio standards. Generation may buy power to meet the energy demand of its customers, including ComEd, PECO and BGE. Generation sells electricity, natural gas, and related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution
utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation s customer facing operations combine a unified sales force with a customer-centric model that
leverages technology to broaden the range of products and solutions offered, which Generation believes promotes stronger customer relationships. This model focuses on efficiency and cost reduction, which provides a platform that is scalable and able
to capitalize on opportunities for future growth.         
  Generation s purchases may be for more than the energy demanded by Generation s customers. Generation then sells this open position, along
with capacity not used to meet customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet
customer delivery needs in markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions, including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of
warmer-than-normal weather conditions. Generation actively manages these physical and contractual assets in order to derive incremental value. Additionally, Generation is involved in the development, exploration, and harvesting of oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids properties.              Price Supply Risk Management
             Generation also manages the price and supply risks
for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into
transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in 2014 and beyond for which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio may be unhedged. Generation has been and will
continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2013, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 92%-95%, 62%-65% and 30%-33% for 2014,
2015, and 2016, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned
or contracted capacity, including purchased power from CENG. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load. A
portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Generation also uses financial and commodity
contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation s efforts. The trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including
volume, stop-loss and value-at-risk limits, to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the corporate risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities. See
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information.   
         18   

At December 31, 2013, Generation s short and long-term commitments relating to the purchase
of energy and capacity from and to unaffiliated utilities and others were as follows:         

(a)  
  Net capacity purchases include PPAs and other capacity contracts including those that are accounted for as operating leases. Amounts presented in the commitments represent
Generation s expected payments under these arrangements at December 31, 2013, net of fixed capacity payments expected to be received by Generation under contracts to resell such acquired capacity to third parties under long-term capacity
sale contracts. Expected payments include certain fixed capacity charges which may be reduced on plant availability.     

(b)  
  The table excludes renewable energy purchases that are contingent in nature.     

(c)  
  Transmission rights purchases include estimated commitments for additional transmission rights that will be required to fulfill firm sales contracts.     
        As part of reaching a comprehensive agreement with EDF in October 2010,
the existing power purchase agreements with CENG were modified to be unit-contingent through the end of their original term in 2014. Under these agreements Generation purchases 85% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG that is not sold to third
parties. CENG has the ability to fix the energy price on a forward basis by entering into monthly energy hedge transactions for a portion of the future sale, while any unhedged portions will be provided at market prices by default. Additionally,
beginning in 2015 and continuing to the end of the life of the respective plants, Generation agreed to purchase 50.01% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG at market prices. This purchase agreement will continue to be effective under the Master
Agreement discussed above, except that if the put option under the Master Agreement is exercised, then the EDF PPA will be transferred to Generation upon the completion of the Put Option Agreement transaction. Generation discloses in the table above
commitments to purchase from CENG at fixed prices. All commitments to purchase from CENG at market prices, which include all purchases subsequent to December 31, 2014, are excluded from the table. Generation continues to own a 50.01% membership
interest in CENG that is accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 25 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this arrangement.   
          Capital Expenditures     
        Generation s business is capital intensive and requires
significant investments in nuclear fuel and energy generation assets and in other internal infrastructure projects. Generation s estimated capital expenditures for 2014 are as follows:         

(a)  
  Includes Generation s share of the investment in nuclear fuel for the co-owned Salem plant.     
         19   

ComEd    
        ComEd is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale
of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services to a diverse base of residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern Illinois. ComEd is a public utility under the Illinois Public Utilities Act subject to
regulation by the ICC related to distribution rates and service, the issuance of securities, and certain other aspects of ComEd s business. ComEd is a public utility under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to
transmission rates and certain other aspects of ComEd s business. Specific operations of ComEd are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, ComEd is subject to NERC mandatory
reliability standards.            ComEd s retail service
territory has an area of approximately 11,400 square miles and an estimated population of 9 million. The service territory includes the City of Chicago, an area of about 225 square miles with an estimated population of 2.7 million. ComEd has
approximately 3.8 million customers.            ComEd s
franchises are sufficient to permit it to engage in the business it now conducts. ComEd s franchise rights are generally nonexclusive rights documented in agreements and, in some cases, certificates of public convenience issued by the ICC. With
few exceptions, the franchise rights have stated expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2066. ComEd anticipates working with the appropriate agencies to extend or replace the franchise agreements prior to expiration.   
        ComEd s kWh deliveries and peak electricity load are generally
higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. ComEd s highest peak load occurred on July 20, 2011, and was 23,753 MWs; its highest peak load during a winter
season occurred on January 6, 2014, and was 16,514 MWs.              Retail
Electric Services              Electric revenues and purchased
power expense are affected by fluctuations in customers  purchases from competitive electric generation suppliers. All ComEd customers have the ability to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. The customers 
choice activity affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy; however, that activity has no impact on electric revenue net of purchased power expense. ComEd s cost of electric supply is passed without markup directly
through to those customers not served by a competitive electric generation supplier and those rates are subject to adjustment monthly to recover or refund the difference between ComEd s actual cost of electricity delivered and the amount
included in rates. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation supplier, ComEd acts as the billing agent but does not record revenues or expenses related to the electric supply. ComEd remains the distribution service provider
for all customers in its service territory and charges a regulated rate for distribution service. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information on customer
switching to competitive electric generation suppliers, and Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s electricity procurement process and for additional information.   
        Under Illinois law, ComEd is required to deliver electricity to all
customers. ComEd s obligation to provide generation supply service, which is referred to as a POLR obligation, primarily varies by customer size. ComEd s obligation to provide such service to residential customers and other small customers
with demands of under 100 kWs continues for all customers who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier or who choose to return to ComEd after taking service from a competitive electric generation supplier. ComEd does not have a
fixed-price generation supply service obligation to most of its largest customers with demands of 100 kWs or greater, as this group of customers has previously been declared competitive. Customers with competitive declarations may still purchase
power and energy from ComEd, but only at hourly market prices.  
         20   

Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act (EIMA).  Since 2011, ComEd s distribution rates are
established through a performance-based rate formula pursuant to EIMA. EIMA also provides a structure for substantial capital investment by utilities over a ten-year period to modernize Illinois  electric utility infrastructure. In addition, as
long as ComEd is subject to EIMA, ComEd will fund customer assistance programs for low-income customers, which amounts will not be recoverable through rates.         
  ComEd files an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect in a given year to reflect the actual costs that the ICC determines are
prudently and reasonably incurred for such year. Under the terms of EIMA, ComEd s target rate of return on common equity is subject to reduction if ComEd does not deliver the reliability and customer service benefits, as defined, it has
committed to over the ten-year life of the investment program. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Electric Distribution Rate Cases . The ICC issued an order in ComEd s 2007 electric distribution rate case (2007 Rate Case) approving a
$274 million increase in ComEd s annual delivery services revenue requirement, which became effective in September 2008. In the order, the ICC authorized a 10.3% rate of return on common equity. On February 23, 2012, the ICC issued an
order in the remand proceeding requiring ComEd to provide a refund of approximately $37 million to customers related to the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation. ComEd and several other parties filed appeals of the rate order with
the Illinois Appellate Court (Court). On September 27, 2013, the Court ruled against ComEd on the accumulated depreciation issue and affirmed that ComEd owes a refund to customers of $37 million. As of December 31, 2013, and
December 31, 2012, ComEd was fully reserved for this liability. ComEd will not seek rehearing or appeal on this matter and is working with the ICC on the process and timing for a refund to customers.   
        On May 24, 2011, the ICC issued an order in ComEd s 2010
electric distribution rate case (2010 Rate Case), which became effective on June 1, 2011. The order approved a $143 million increase to ComEd s annual delivery service revenue requirement and a 10.5% rate of return on common equity. The
order has been appealed to the Court by several parties. On May 16, 2013, the Court dismissed as moot the appeals of the ICC s order in the 2010 Rate Case as ComEd now recovers distribution costs under EIMA through a pre-established
formula rate tariff. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s electric distribution rate cases.   
         Procurement-Related Proceedings.  Since June 2009, the IPA
designs, and the ICC approves, an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and the IPA administers a competitive process under which ComEd procures its electricity supply from various suppliers, including Generation. As required by EIMA, in February
2012 the IPA completed procurement events for energy and REC requirements for the June 2013 through December 2017 period. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s procurement
plans. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s energy commitments.         
   Continuous Power Interruption.  The Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that in the event an electric utility, such as ComEd, experiences a
continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in ComEd s case) more than 30,000 customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as a result of the interruption and may be responsible for
reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek from the ICC a waiver of these liabilities when the
utility can show that the cause of the interruption was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         21   

Smart Meter, Smart Grid and Energy Efficiency Programs     
         Smart Meter and Smart Grid Programs.  On January 6, 2012,
ComEd filed its Infrastructure Investment Plan with the ICC. Under that plan, ComEd will invest approximately $2.6 billion over ten years to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology. On April 23,
2012, ComEd filed its initial AMI Deployment Plan with the ICC, which was approved by the ICC on June 22, 2012, with certain modifications. ComEd outlined the new deployment schedule within testimony provided in the AMI Plan Rehearing and filed
a revised AMI deployment plan with the ICC. On December 5, 2012, the ICC approved ComEd s revised AMI deployment plan. On June 5, 2013, the ICC issued an interim Order approving ComEd s accelerated AMI deployment plan consistent
with the provisions of Senate Bill 9. The deployment plan provides for the installation of 4 million electric smart meters, of which more than 60,000 meters were installed by the end of 2013.   
         Energy Efficiency Programs.  As a result of the Illinois
Settlement Legislation, electric utilities in Illinois are required to include cost-effective energy efficiency resources in their plans to meet an incremental annual program energy savings requirement of 0.2% of energy delivered to retail customers
for the year ended June 1, 2009, which increases annually to 2.0% of energy delivered in the year commencing June 1, 2015 and each year thereafter. Additionally, during the ten-year period that began June 1, 2008, electric utilities
must implement cost-effective demand response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers. The energy efficiency and demand response goals are subject to rate impact caps each year. Utilities are allowed
recovery of costs for energy efficiency and demand response programs, subject to approval by the ICC. In December 2010, the ICC approved ComEd s second three-year Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan covering the period June 2011 through
May 2014. The plans are designed to meet the Illinois Settlement Legislation s energy efficiency and demand response goals through May 2014, including reductions in delivered energy to all retail customers and in the peak demand of eligible
retail customers.            EIMA provides for additional energy
efficiency in Illinois. Starting in the June 2013 May 2014 period and occurring annually thereafter, as part of the IPA procurement plan, ComEd is to include cost-effective expansion of current energy efficiency programs, any additional
new cost-effective program and/or third-party energy efficiency programs that are identified through a request for proposal ( RFP ) process. All cost-effective energy efficiency programs are included in the IPA procurement plan for
consideration of implementation. While these programs are monitored separately from the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS), funds for both the EEPS portfolio and IPA energy efficiency programs are collected under the same rider.
             Construction Budget     
        ComEd s business is capital intensive and requires significant
investments primarily in energy transmission and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. Based on PJM s RTEP, ComEd has various construction commitments, as discussed in Note 3 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ComEd s most recent estimate of capital expenditures for electric plant additions and improvements for 2014 is $1,775 million, which includes RTEP projects and infrastructure modernization
resulting from EIMA. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.               PECO          
  PECO is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to
retail customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and   
         22   

the provision of gas distribution services to retail customers in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia. PECO is a public utility under the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Code subject to regulation by the PAPUC as to electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuances of certain securities and certain other aspects of PECO s operations. PECO is a public utility under the Federal Power Act subject to
regulation by FERC as to transmission rates and certain other aspects of PECO s business and by the U.S. Department of Transportation as to pipeline safety and other areas of gas operations. Specific operations of PECO are subject to the
jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, PECO is also subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards.         
  PECO s combined electric and natural gas retail service territory has an area of approximately 2,100 square miles and an estimated population
of 4.0 million. PECO provides electric distribution service in an area of approximately 1,900 square miles, with a population of approximately 3.9 million, including approximately 1.5 million in the City of Philadelphia. PECO provides
natural gas distribution service in an area of approximately 1,900 square miles in southeastern Pennsylvania adjacent to the City of Philadelphia, with a population of approximately 2.4 million. PECO delivers electricity to approximately
1.6 million customers and natural gas to approximately 501,000 customers.            PECO has the necessary authorizations to provide regulated electric and natural gas distribution service in the various municipalities or territories in which it now supplies such services. PECO s
authorizations consist of charter rights and certificates of public convenience issued by the PAPUC and/or  grandfathered rights,  which are rights generally unlimited as to time and generally exclusive from competition from other electric
and natural gas utilities. In a few defined municipalities, PECO s natural gas service territory authorizations overlap with that of another natural gas utility; however, PECO does not consider those situations as posing a material competitive
or financial threat.            PECO s kWh sales and peak
electricity load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. PECO s highest peak load occurred on July 22, 2011 and was 8,983 MW; its
highest peak load during winter months occurred on January 7, 2014 and was 7,148 MW.            PECO s natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. PECO s highest daily natural gas send out occurred on January 7, 2014
and was 760 mmcf.              Retail Electric Services     
        PECO s retail electric sales and distribution service revenues
are derived pursuant to rates regulated by the PAPUC. Pennsylvania permits competition by competitive electric generation suppliers for the supply of retail electricity while retail transmission and distribution service remains regulated under the
Competition Act. At December 31, 2013, there were 87 competitive electric generation suppliers serving PECO customers. At December 31, 2013, the number of retail customers purchasing energy from a competitive electric generation supplier
was 531,500 representing approximately 34% of total retail customers. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented approximately 68% of PECO s retail kWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Customers that choose a competitive electric generation supplier are not subject to rates for PECO s electric supply procurement costs and retail transmission service charges. PECO presents on customer bills its electric supply Price to
Compare, which is updated quarterly, to assist customers with the evaluation of offers from competitive electric generation suppliers.         
  Customer choice program activity affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy; however, that activity has no impact on
electric revenue net of purchased power expense or PECO s financial position. PECO s cost of electric supply is passed directly through to default service   
         23   

customers without markup and those rates are subject to adjustment at least quarterly to recover or refund the difference between PECO s actual cost of electricity delivered and the amount
included in rates through the GSA. For those customers that choose a competitive electric generation supplier, PECO acts as the billing agent but does not record revenues or purchase power expense related to this electric supply. PECO remains the
distribution service provider for all customers in its service territory and charges a regulated rate for distribution service.         
   Procurement Proceedings.  PECO s electric supply for its customers is procured through contracts executed in accordance with its
PAPUC-approved DSP Programs. PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, as part of its DSP I competitive procurements conducted since June 2009 for its default electric supply beginning January 2011, which
included fixed price full requirement contracts for all procurement classes, spot market price full requirements contracts for the commercial and industrial procurement classes, and block energy contracts for the residential procurement class. In
September 2012, PECO completed its last competitive procurement for electric supply under its first DSP Program, which expired on May 31, 2013.         
  On October 12, 2012, the PAPUC approved PECO s second DSP Program, which was filed with the PAPUC in January 2012. The plan outlines how
PECO is purchasing electric supply for default service customers from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2015. Pursuant to the second DSP Program, PECO is procuring electric supply through five competitive procurements for fixed price full
requirements contracts of two years or less for the residential and small and medium commercial classes and spot market price full requirement contracts for the large commercial and industrial class load. In December 2012 and February 2013, PECO
entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, for its residential and small and medium commercial classes that began in June 2013. In September 2013, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including
Generation, for its residential and small and medium commercial classes that began in December 2013. In January 2014, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, for its residential and small, medium and large
commercial classes that will begin in June 2014. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in purchased power from affiliates on PECO s Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
           The second DSP Program also includes a number of retail
market enhancements recommended by the PAPUC in its previously issued Retail Markets Intermediate Work Plan Order. PECO was also directed to allow its low-income Customer Assistance Program (CAP) customers to purchase their generation supply from
competitive electric generation suppliers beginning April 1, 2014. On May 1, 2013, PECO filed a Petition for Approval of its CAP Shopping Plan with the PAPUC, which the PAPUC granted and denied in part on January 9, 2014. PECO and other parties
to the proceeding filed petitions for reconsideration of the Commission s decision on February 10, 2014, and these petitions are currently pending before the PAPUC.   
        See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.              Smart Meter, Smart Grid and Energy
Efficiency Programs               Smart Meter and Smart Grid
Programs.  In April 2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan, which was filed in accordance with the requirements of Act 129. Also, in April 2010, PECO entered into a Financial Assistance Agreement with
the DOE for SGIG funds under the ARRA of 2009. Under the SGIG, PECO has been awarded $200 million, the maximum grant allowable under the program, for its SGIG project Smart Future Greater Philadelphia. The SGIG funds are being used to offset
the total impact to ratepayers of the smart meter deployment required by Act 129. On January 18, 2013, PECO filed with the PAPUC its universal deployment plan for approval of its proposal to deploy the remainder of the 1.6 million smart
meters on an accelerated basis by the   
         24   

end of 2014. On May 31, 2013, PECO and interested parties filed a Joint Petition for Settlement of the universal deployment plan with the PAPUC, which was approved without modification on
August 15, 2013. In total, PECO currently expects to spend up to $595 million and $120 million on its smart meter and smart grid infrastructure, respectively, before considering the $200 million SGIG.   
        See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.             Energy Efficiency
Programs.  PECO s PAPUC-approved Phase I EE C plan had a four-year term that began on June 1, 2009 and concluded on May 31, 2013. The Phase I Plan sets forth how PECO would meet the required reduction targets established by Act
129 s EE C provisions, which included a 3% reduction in electric consumption in PECO s service territory and a 4.5% reduction in PECO s annual system peak demand in the 100 hours of highest demand by May 31, 2013. The peak
demand period ended on September 30, 2012 and PECO communicated its compliance with the reduction targets in a preliminary report with the PAPUC on March 1, 2013. The final compliance report was filed with the PAPUC on November 15,
2013.            The PAPUC issued its Phase II EE C implementation
order on August 2, 2012, that provides energy consumption reduction requirements for the second phase of Act 129 s EE C programs, which went into effect on June 1, 2013. The PAPUC deferred a decision on peak demand reduction
requirements until late 2013. On February 28, 2013, the PAPUC approved PECO s three-year EE C Phase II plan that was filed with the PAPUC on November 1, 2012, and sets forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least
1,125,852 MWh in its service territory for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016.            See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
    Natural Gas           
  PECO s natural gas sales and distribution service revenues are derived through natural gas deliveries at rates regulated by the PAPUC.
PECO s purchased natural gas cost rates, which represent a significant portion of total rates, are subject to quarterly adjustments designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased natural gas and the amount
included in rates without markup through the PGC.         
  PECO s natural gas customers have the right to choose their natural gas suppliers or to purchase their gas supply from PECO at cost. At
December 31, 2013, the number of retail customers purchasing natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier was 66,400, representing approximately 13% of total retail customers. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas
suppliers represented approximately 19% of PECO s mmcf sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. PECO provides distribution, billing, metering, installation, maintenance and emergency response services at regulated rates to all its
customers in its service territory.             Procurement
Proceedings . PECO s natural gas supply is purchased from a number of suppliers primarily under long-term firm transportation contracts for terms of up to three years in accordance with its annual PAPUC PGC settlement. PECO s aggregate
annual firm supply under these firm transportation contracts is 34 million dekatherms. Peak natural gas is provided by PECO s liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility and propane-air plant. PECO also has under contract 21 million
dekatherms of underground storage through service agreements. Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 30% of PECO s 2013-2014 heating season planned supplies.            See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         25   

Construction Budget     
        PECO s business is capital intensive and requires significant
investments primarily in electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution facilities to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. PECO, as a transmission facilities owner, has various construction
commitments under PJM s RTEP as discussed in Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO s most recent estimate of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2014 is $625 million, which
includes RTEP projects and capital expenditures related to the smart meter and smart grid project net of expected SGIG DOE reimbursements.         
     BGE          
  BGE is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to
retail customers in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services to retail customers in central Maryland, including the City of
Baltimore. BGE is a public utility under the Public Utilities Article of the Maryland Annotated Code subject to regulation by the MDPSC as to electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuances of certain securities and certain other
aspects of BGE s operations. BGE is a public utility under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC as to transmission rates and certain other aspects of BGE s business and by the U.S. Department of Transportation as to pipeline
safety and other areas of gas operations. Specific operations of BGE are subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, BGE is also subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards.   
        BGE serves an estimated population of 2.8 million in its 2,300
square mile combined electric and gas retail service territory. BGE provides electric distribution service in an area of approximately 2,300 square miles and gas distribution service in an area of approximately 800 square miles, both with a
population of approximately 2.8 million, including approximately 621,000 in the City of Baltimore. BGE delivers electricity to approximately 1.2 million customers and natural gas to approximately 655,000 customers.   
        BGE has the necessary authorizations to provide regulated electric and
natural gas distribution services in the various municipalities and territories in which it now supplies such services. With respect to electric distribution service, BGE s authorizations consist of charter rights, a state-wide franchise grant
and a franchise grant from the City of Baltimore. The franchise rights are not exclusive and are perpetual. With respect to natural gas distribution service, BGE s authorizations consist of charter rights, a perpetual state-wide franchise
grant, and franchises granted by all the municipalities and/or governmental bodies in which BGE now supplies services. The franchise grants are not exclusive; some are perpetual and some are for a limited duration, which BGE anticipates being able
to extend or replace prior to expiration.            BGE s kWh
sales and peak electricity load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. BGE s highest peak load occurred on July 21, 2011 and was 7,236
MW; its highest peak load during winter months occurred on January 7, 2014 and was 6,526 MW.            BGE s natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. BGE s highest daily natural gas send out occurred on February 5, 2007 and was
840 mmcf.            The demand for electricity and gas is affected by
weather and usage conditions. The MDPSC has allowed BGE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas distribution revenues from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric customers,
and all firm service gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per   
         26   

customer on BGE s electric and gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per customer, by customer class, regardless of changes in
consumption levels. This adjustment allows BGE to recognize revenues at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes were for a billing period (referred to as  revenue decoupling ). Therefore, while
these revenues are affected by customer growth, they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions. BGE bills or credits affected customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling
and actual customer billings.              Retail Electric Services
             BGE s retail electric sales and distribution
service revenues are derived from electricity deliveries at rates regulated by the MDPSC. As a result of the deregulation of electric generation in Maryland effective July 1, 2000, all customers can choose a competitive electric generation
supplier. While BGE does not sell electric supply to all customers in its service territory, BGE continues to deliver electricity to all customers and provides meter reading, billing, emergency response, and regular maintenance services. Customer
choice program activity affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy; however, that activity has minimal impact on electric revenue net of purchased power expense or BGE s financial position. At December 31, 2013,
there were 73 competitive electric generation suppliers serving BGE customers. At December 31, 2013, the number of retail customers purchasing energy from a competitive electric generation supplier was approximately 399,000, representing 32% of
total retail customers. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented approximately 61% of BGE s retail kWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2013.   
        BGE is obligated to provide market-based SOS to all of its electric
customers. The SOS rates charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes a commercial and industrial shareholder return component and an incremental cost
component. Bidding to supply BGE s market-based SOS occurs through a competitive bidding process approved by the MDPSC. Successful bidders, which may include Generation, will execute contracts with BGE for terms of three months or two
years.            BGE is obligated by the MDPSC to provide several
variations of SOS to commercial and industrial customers depending on customer load.             Electric Distribution Rate Cases.  In December 2010, the MDPSC issued an abbreviated electric rate order authorizing BGE to increase electric distribution rates for service rendered on or after
December 4, 2010 by no more than $31 million. In March 2011, the MDPSC issued a comprehensive rate order setting forth the details of the decision contained in its abbreviated combined electric and gas distribution rate order issued in
December 2010. As part of the March 2011 comprehensive rate order, BGE was authorized to defer $19 million of costs as regulatory assets. These costs are being recovered over a 5-year period beginning in December 2010 and include the deferral of $16
million of storm costs incurred in February 2010. The regulatory asset for the storm costs earns the authorized rate of return.         
  On July 27, 2012, BGE filed an application for an increase to its electric base rates with the MDPSC. On February 22, 2013, the MDPSC
issued an order in BGE s 2012 electric rate case for increases in annual distribution service revenue of $81 million. The electric distribution rate increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.75%.   
        On May 17, 2013, BGE filed an application for an increase to its
electric base rates with the MDPSC. On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order in BGE s 2013 electric distribution rate case authorizing an increase in annual distribution service revenue of $34 million. The electric distribution rate
increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.75%. The approved electric distribution rate became effective for services rendered on or after December 13, 2013.   
         27   

Smart Meter and Energy Efficiency Programs               Smart Meter Programs.  In August 2010, the MDPSC approved BGE s $480 million SGIP, which includes
deployment of a two-way communications network, 2 million smart electric and gas meters and modules, new customer pricing programs, a new customer web portal and numerous enhancements to BGE operations. Also, in April 2010, BGE entered into a
Financial Assistance Agreement with the DOE for SGIG funds under the ARRA of 2009. Under the SGIG, BGE has been awarded $200 million, the maximum grant allowable under the program, to support its Smart Grid, Peak Rewards and CC B
initiatives. The SGIG funding is being used to reduce significantly the rate impact of those investments on BGE customers. As of December 31, 2013, BGE has billed the entire $200 million grant to the DOE.   
         Energy Efficiency Programs.  BGE s energy efficiency
programs include a CFL program, retrofit programs, an energy efficient appliance rebate and trade-in program, rebates and energy efficiency programs for non-profit, educational, governmental and business customers, customer incentives for energy
management programs and incentives to help customers reduce energy demand during peak periods. The MDPSC initially approved a full portfolio of conservation programs as well as a customer surcharge to recover the associated costs. This customer
surcharge is updated annually. In December 2011, the MDPSC approved BGE s conservation programs for implementation in 2012 through 2014.         
    Natural Gas           
  BGE s natural gas sales are derived pursuant to a MBR mechanism that applies to customers who buy their gas from BGE. Under this mechanism,
BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers. Customer
choice program activity affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied natural gas; however, that activity has minimum impact on gas revenue net of purchased power expense or BGE s financial position. At December 31, 2013,
there were 41 competitive natural gas suppliers serving BGE customers. At December 31, 2013, the number of retail customers purchasing fuel from a competitive natural gas supplier was approximately 172,000 representing 26% of total retail
customers. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas suppliers represented approximately 54% of BGE s retail mmcf sales for the year ended December 31, 2013.            BGE must secure fixed price contracts for at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of forecasted system supply requirements
for flowing (i.e., non-storage) gas for the November through March period. These fixed price contracts are recovered under the MBR mechanism and are not subject to sharing. BGE meets its natural gas load requirements through firm pipeline
transportation and storage entitlements. BGE s current pipeline firm transportation entitlements to serve its firm loads are 362 mmcf per day.         
  BGE s current maximum storage entitlements are 284 mmcf per day. To supplement its gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and to be
available in temporary emergencies affecting gas supply, BGE has:         

a liquefied natural gas facility for the liquefaction and storage of natural gas with a total storage capacity of 1,055 mmcf and a daily capacity of 332 mmcf,

a liquefied natural gas facility for natural gas system pressure support with a total storage capacity of 6 mmcf and a daily capacity of 6 mmcf, and

a propane air facility and a mined cavern with a total storage capacity equivalent to 546 mmcf and a daily capacity of 85 mmcf.      
        BGE has under contract sufficient volumes of propane for the operation
of the propane air facility and is capable of liquefying sufficient volumes of natural gas during the summer months for operations   
         28   

of its liquefied natural gas facility during peak winter periods. BGE historically has been able to arrange short-term contracts or exchange agreements with other gas companies in the event of
short-term disruptions to gas supplies or to meet additional demand.            BGE also participates in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale
suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between shareholders and customers. BGE makes these sales as part of a program to balance its supply of, and cost of, natural gas.   
         Natural Gas Distribution Rate Cases.  In December 2010, the MDPSC
issued a rate order authorizing BGE to increase the gas distribution base revenue requirement for service rendered on or after December 4, 2010 by no more than $9.8 million. In March 2011, the MDPSC issued a comprehensive rate order
setting forth the details of the decision contained in its abbreviated combined electric and gas distribution rate order issued in December 2010.         
  On July 27, 2012, BGE filed an application for an increase to its gas base rates with the MDPSC. On February 22, 2013, the MDPSC issued an
order in BGE s 2012 gas rate case for increases in annual distribution service revenue of $32 million. The electric distribution rate increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.60%.   
        On May 17, 2013, BGE filed an application for an increase to its
gas base rates with the MDPSC. On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order in BGE s 2013 natural gas distribution rate case authorizing an increase in annual distribution service revenue of $12 million. The gas distribution rate
increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.60%. The approved natural gas distribution rate became effective for services rendered on or after December 13, 2013.   
          Construction Budget     
        BGE s business is capital intensive and requires significant
investments primarily in electric and natural gas distribution and electric transmission facilities to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. BGE, as a transmission facilities owner, has various construction
commitments under PJM s RTEP as discussed in Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. BGE s most recent estimate of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2014 is approximately $600 million,
which includes capital expenditures related to the SGIP net of expected SGIG DOE reimbursements.             ComEd, PECO and BGE          
    Transmission Services           
  ComEd, PECO and BGE provide unbundled transmission service under rates approved by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage
competition for wholesale generation services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. Under FERC s open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, ComEd, PECO and BGE, as owners of
transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. ComEd, PECO and BGE are required to comply with FERC s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the
communication of non-public information between the transmission owner s employees and wholesale merchant employees.         
  PJM is the ISO and the FERC-approved RTO for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of,
the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff), operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls   
         29   

the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. ComEd, PECO and BGE are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. ComEd, PECO,
BGE and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on
a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.         
  ComEd s transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in January 2008. FERC s order establishes the
agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis.   
        PECO default service customers are charged for retail transmission
services through a rider designed to recover PECO s PJM transmission network service charges and RTEP charges on a full and current basis in accordance with the 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement.   
        The transmission rate in the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff under
which PECO incurs costs to serve its default service customers and earns revenue as a transmission facility owner is a FERC-approved rate. This is the rate that all load serving entities in the PECO transmission zone pay for wholesale transmission
service.            BGE s transmission rates are established
based on a formula that was approved by FERC in April 2006. FERC s order establishes the agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate
calculation on an annual basis.            See Note 3 of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding transmission services.               Employees             As of December 31, 2013, Exelon and its subsidiaries had 25,829 employees in the following companies, of which 8,602 or 33% were covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs):   

(a)  
  A separate CBA between ComEd and IBEW Local 15, ratified on October 10, 2012, covers approximately 32 employees in ComEd s System Services Group. Generation s and
ComEd s separate CBAs with IBEW Local 15 were extended through February 28, 2014.     

(b)  
  1,254 PECO craft and call center employees in the Philadelphia service territory are covered by CBAs with IBEW Local 614. The CBAs expire on March 31, 2015. Additionally,
Exelon Power, an operating unit of Generation, has an agreement with IBEW Local 614, which expires on November 3, 2016 and covers 107 employees.     
 
         30   

(d)  
  Other includes shared services employees at BSC.           
     Environmental Regulation          
    General           
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are subject to comprehensive and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal
government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to regulations administered by the U.S. EPA and various state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state
and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal.         
  The Exelon board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address
environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as
senior management of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The
Exelon board has delegated to its corporate governance committee authority to oversee Exelon s compliance with laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including, Exelon s
climate change and sustainability policies and programs, and Exelon 2020, Exelon s comprehensive business and environmental plan, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon board has also delegated to its generation oversight committee
authority to oversee environmental, health and safety issues relating to Generation. The respective boards of ComEd, PECO and BGE, which each include directors who also serve on the Exelon board, oversee environmental, health and safety issues
related to ComEd, PECO and BGE.              Air Quality     
        Air quality regulations promulgated by the U.S.
EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ), nitrogen oxides (NO   x   ), mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such permits have been obtained by
Exelon s subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Clean Air Act establishes a comprehensive and complex national program to reduce substantially air pollution from power plants. Advanced emission controls for SO   2    and NOx have been installed at all of Generation s co-owned bituminous coal-fired
units.            See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding clean air regulation and legislation in the forms of the CSAPR and CAIR, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating facilities under MATS, and
regulation of GHG emissions, in addition to NOVs issued to Generation and ComEd for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.         
    Water Quality           
  Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the U.S. EPA or from the state environmental
agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Generation s power generation facilities   
         31   

discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being
granted an administrative extension.            See Note 22 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact to Exelon of state permitting agencies  administration of the Phase II rule implementing Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act.   
        Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state
and regional agencies and compacts, including the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.         
    Solid and Hazardous Waste           
  The CERCLA provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the U.S. EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous
substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA,
generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are listed by the U.S.
EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with a U.S. EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the U.S. EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or
may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially
similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.   
        Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE and their subsidiaries are, or are
likely to become, parties to proceedings initiated by the U.S. EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for
which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party.            See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding solid and hazardous waste regulation and legislation.   
          Environmental Remediation     
        ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s environmental liabilities
primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover environmental remediation costs of
the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The amount to be
expended in 2014 at Exelon for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites is expected to total $40 million, consisting of $33 million, $6 million and $1 million at ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively.
           Generation s environmental liabilities primarily arise
from contamination at current and former generation and waste storage facilities. As of December 31, 2013, Generation has established an appropriate liability to comply with environmental remediation requirements including contamination
attributable to low level radioactive residues at a storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue, and at a disposal facility named West Lake Landfill, both near St. Louis, Missouri related to operations conducted by Cotter Corporation, a
former ComEd subsidiary.   
         32   

In addition, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE may be required to make significant additional
expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs.            See Notes 3 and 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the

    Global Climate Change           
  Exelon believes the evidence of global climate change is compelling and that the energy industry, though not alone, is a
significant contributor to the human-caused emissions of GHGs that many in the scientific community believe contribute to global climate change, and as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in their Fifth Assessment Report
Summary for Policy Makers issues September 2013. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly low-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar photovoltaic), has a relatively small GHG emission profile, or
carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment in low-carbon intensity assets, Generation s emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO   2   e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon
does produce GHG emissions, primarily at its fossil fuel-fired generating plants; CO   2   , methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process, with CO   2    representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels represent the majority of Exelon s direct GHG emissions in 2013, although only a small portion of
Exelon s electric supply is from fossil generating plants. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride (SF   6   ) leakage in its electric transmission and distribution operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as
well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and usage of electricity at its facilities. Despite its focus on  low-carbon  generation, Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by
the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for information regarding the market and financial, regulatory and legislative, and operational risks associated with
climate change.              Climate Change
Regulation.   Exelon is, or may become, subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and state levels.         
   International Climate Change Regulation.  At the international level, the United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Kyoto
Protocol, which was extended at the 2012 meeting of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 18). The Kyoto Protocol now requires participating developed countries to cap GHG emissions at certain levels until
2020, when the new global agreement on emissions reduction is scheduled to become effective. This new global agreement for GHG emissions reductions was agreed to only in concept during the COP18, with a timeline for establishing the global targets
by 2015. On November 22, 2013, at the 2013 COP 19 held in Warsaw, Poland, participating countries further agreed to provide their  intended nationally determined contributions  by the first quarter of 2015 in preparation for formally
setting global target in 2015. The other major issues discussed at COP 19 were demands from developing countries for increased climate finance, and for a new mechanism to help especially vulnerable nations cope with unavoidable  loss and
damage  resulting from climate change. Developed countries, which had previously promised to mobilize a total of $100 billion a year by 2020, refused to set a quantified interim goal for ramping up climate finance.   
         Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  Various
stakeholders, including Exelon, legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors are considering ways to address the climate change issue,
  
         33   

including the enactment of federal climate change legislation. It is highly uncertain whether Federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted. If such legislation is adopted, Exelon
may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to procure emission allowances or credits. In June 2013, the White House released the President s Climate Action Plan which consists of a wide variety of
executive actions targeting GHG reductions, preparing for the impacts of climate change and showing leadership internationally; but the plan did not directly trigger any new requirements or legislative action.   
        The U.S. EPA is addressing the issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
regulation for new and existing electric generating units through the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to President Obama s June 25, 2013 memorandum to U.S. EPA, the Agency
re-proposed a Section 111(b) regulation for new units in September 2013 that may result in material costs of compliance for CO2 emissions for new fossil-fuel electric generating units, particularly coal-fired units. Under the President s
memorandum, the U.S. EPA is also required to propose a Section 111(d) rule no later than June 1, 2014 to establish CO2 emission regulations for existing stationary sources.             Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  After a two-year program review, the nine
northeast and mid-Atlantic states currently participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Initiative (RGGI) released an updated RGGI Model Rule and Program Review Recommendations Summary on February 7, 2013. Under the updated RGGI
program, which must be approved pursuant to the applicable legislative and/or regulatory process in each RGGI state, the regional RGGI CO2 budget would be reduced, starting in 2014, from its current 165 million ton level to 91 million
tons, with a 2.5 percent reduction in the cap level each year between 2015-2020. Included in the new program are provisions for cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances, which will become available if the total demand for allowances, above the CCR
trigger price, exceeds the number of CO2 allowances available for purchase at auction. (CCR trigger prices are $4 in 2014, $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016 and $10 in 2017, rising 2.5 percent thereafter to account for inflation). Such an outcome could put
modest upward pressure on wholesale power prices; however, the specifics are currently uncertain.            At the state level, the Illinois Climate Change Advisory Group, created by Executive Order  2006-11  on October 5, 2006, made its final recommendations on
September 6, 2007 to meet the Governor s GHG reduction goals. At this time, the only requirements imposed by the state of Illinois are the energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards in the Illinois Power Act that apply to ComEd.
           On December 18, 2009, Pennsylvania issued the
state s final Climate Change Action Plan. The plan sets as a target a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The Climate Change Advisory Committee continues to meet quarterly to review Climate Action Work Plans for the residential,
commercial and industrial sectors. The Climate Change Action Plan does not impose any requirements on Generation or PECO at this time.         
  The Maryland Commission on Climate Change released its climate action plan on August 27, 2008, recommending that the state begin implementing
42 greenhouse gas reduction strategies. One of the Plan s policy recommendations, to adopt science-based regulatory goals to reduce Maryland s GHG emissions, was realized with the passage of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act of
2009 (GGRA). The law requires Maryland to reduce its GHG emissions by 25 percent below 2006 levels by 2020. It directed the MDE to work with other state agencies to prepare an implementation plan to meet this goal. The implementation plan was
published in October of 2013. Maryland targeted electricity consumption reduction goals required under the  Empower Maryland  program, and mandatory State participation in the recently updated and enhanced RGGI Program are listed as that
sector s contribution in the plan. The plan also advocates raising the renewable portfolio standard requirement from 22% by 2022 to 25% by 2022.   
         34   

Exelon s Voluntary Climate Change Efforts . In a world increasingly concerned about global
climate change and regulatory action to reduce GHG, Exelon s low-carbon generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest carbon electric generators in the United States: nuclear for
base load, natural gas for marginal and peak demand, hydro and pumped storage, and supplemental wind and solar renewables. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of GHG and air pollutants are promulgated,
Exelon s low-carbon, low-emission generation fleet will position the company to benefit from its comparative advantage over other generation fleets.         
  With the announcement in 2008 of Exelon 2020, Exelon set a voluntary goal to reduce, offset or displace more than 15.7 million metric tonnes of
GHG emissions per year by 2020. Exelon updated that goal in 2012 following the Constellation merger to account for the integration of former Constellation GHG goals. The updated Exelon 2020 goal is to reduce, offset or displace more than
17.5 million metric tonnes of GHG emissions by 2020. The Exelon 2020 goal encompasses three broad areas of focus: reducing or offsetting Exelon s own carbon footprint (with the year the asset/operations were acquired by Exelon as the
baseline), helping customers and communities reduce their GHG emissions, and offering more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. Exelon has been maintaining strong performance towards achieving the goal and anticipates reaching the
17.5 million tons of annual abatement well before 2020.         
    Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards           
  Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of RPS requirement. As previously described, Illinois, Pennsylvania and
Maryland have laws specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the future by the United States Congress. Also,
states that currently do not have RPS requirements may adopt such legislation in the future.            The Illinois Settlement Legislation required that procurement plans implemented by electric utilities include cost-effective renewable energy resources or approved equivalents such as RECs in amounts that equal or
exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers by June 1, 2008, increasing to 10% by June 1, 2015, with a goal of 25% by June 1, 2025. Utilities are allowed to pass-through any
costs from the procurement of these renewable resources or approved equivalents subject to legislated rate impact criteria. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to
comply with the Illinois Settlement Legislation. See Note 3 and Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
  The AEPS Act became effective for PECO on January 1, 2011, following the expiration of PECO s transition period. During 2013, PECO was
required to supply approximately 4.0% of electric energy generated from Tier I (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy, coal mine methane and black liquor
generated within Pennsylvania) through May 31, 2013 and subsequently 4.5% beginning June 1, 2013 and continuing through May 31, 2014. PECO was also required to supply 6.2% of electric energy generated from Tier II (including waste
coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing wood and by-products of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification
technology) alternative energy resources, respectively, as measured in AECs. The compliance requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to comply with these requirements, PECO entered into
agreements with varying terms with accepted bidders, including Generation, to purchase non-solar Tier I, solar Tier 1 and Tier II AECs. PECO also purchases AECs through its DSP Program full requirement contracts.   
         35   

Section 7-703 of the Public Utilities Article in Maryland sets forth the RPS requirement, which
applies to all retail electricity sales in Maryland by electricity suppliers. The RPS requirement requires that suppliers obtain a specified percentage of the electricity it sells from Tier 1 sources (solar, wind, biomass, methane, geothermal,
ocean, fuel cell, small hydroelectric, and poultry litter) and Tier 2 sources (hydroelectric, other than pump storage generation, and waste-to-energy). The RPS requirement began in 2006, requiring that suppliers procure 1.0% and 2.5% from Tier
1 and Tier 2 sources, respectively, escalating in 2022 to 22.0% from Tier 1 sources, including at least 2.0% from solar energy, and a phase out of Tier 2 resource options by 2022. In 2013, 8.2% was required from Tier 1 renewable sources, including
at least 0.25% derived from solar energy, and 2.5% from Tier 2 renewable sources. The wholesale suppliers that supply power to the state s utilities through the SOS procurement auctions have the obligation, by contract with those
utilities, to comply with and provide its proportional share of the RPS requirements.            Similar to ComEd, PECO and BGE, Generation s retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in many of the states in which it does business from renewable resources or approved
equivalents such as RECs. Potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources could increase the pace of development of wind and other renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on
wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time, such developments may present some opportunities for sales of Generation s renewable power, including from wind, solar,
hydroelectric and landfill gas.            See Note 3 and Note 22 of
the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.               Executive Officers of the Registrants as of February 13, 2014

  On February 12, 2014, Kenneth W. DeFontes Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer at BGE announced his retirement from BGE on February 28, 2014. Effective
March 1, 2014, Calvin G. Butler Jr. will become Chief Executive Officer of BGE and an executive officer of Exelon and Stephen J. Woerner will become President and continue as Chief Operating Officer of BGE.     

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS            
  Each of the Registrants operates in a market and regulatory environment that poses significant risks, many of which are beyond the Registrant s
control. Management of each Registrant regularly meets with the Chief Risk Officer and the RMC, which comprises officers of the Registrants, to identify and evaluate the most significant risks of the Registrants  businesses, and the appropriate
steps to manage and mitigate those risks. The Chief Risk Officer and senior executives of the Registrants discuss those risks with the finance and risk committee and audit committees of the Exelon board of directors and the ComEd, PECO and BGE
boards of directors. In addition, the generation oversight committee of the Exelon board of directors  evaluates risks related to the generation business. The risk factors discussed below may adversely affect one or more of the
Registrants  results of operations and cash flows and the market prices of their publicly traded securities. Each of the Registrants has disclosed the known material risks that affect its business at this time. However, there may be further
risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by a Registrant to be material that may adversely affect its performance or financial condition in the future.   
        The Registrants  most significant risks arise as a consequence of:
(1) Generation s position as a predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy markets with a concentration in select regions, and (2) the role of ComEd, PECO and BGE as operators of electric transmission and
distribution systems in three of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The Registrants  major risks fall primarily under the following categories:   

Market and Financial Risks.   Exelon s and Generation s market and financial risks include the risk of price fluctuations in the power
markets. Power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular the prices of natural gas and coal, which drive the prices that Generation can obtain for the output of
its power plants, (2) the rate of expansion of subsidized low-carbon generation in the markets in which Generation s output is sold, (3) the effects on energy demand of factors such as weather, economic conditions and implementation
of energy efficiency and demand response programs, and (4) the impacts of increased competition in the retail channel.      
         41   

Regulatory and Legislative Risks.   The Registrants  regulatory and legislative risks include changes to the laws and regulations that govern
competitive markets and utility cost recovery, and that drive environmental policy. In particular, Exelon s and Generation s financial performance may be adversely affected by changes that could affect Generation s ability to sell
power into the competitive wholesale power markets at market-based prices. In addition, potential regulation and legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standards could increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities,
which could put downward pressure in some markets on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation s nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets
under a carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. Also, regulatory actions in Illinois, Pennsylvania or Maryland could materially lower returns for ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively.      

Operational Risks.   The Registrants  operational risks include those risks inherent in running the nation s largest fleet of nuclear power
reactors and large electric and gas distribution systems. The safe and effective operation of the nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations as well as the ability to maintain the
availability, reliability and safety of its energy delivery systems are fundamental to Exelon s ability to protect and grow shareholder value. Additionally, the operating costs of ComEd, PECO and BGE, and the opinions of customers and
regulators of ComEd, PECO and BGE, are affected by those companies  ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery systems.      

Risks Related to the Merger with Constellation and the Pending Master Agreement between Generation and CENG.   As a result of the merger with
Constellation that closed on March 12, 2012, Exelon may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting commitments it made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals from the July 29, 2013 Master
Agreement between Exelon, Generation and subsidiaries of Generation with EDF, EDF Inc. (EDFI) (a subsidiary of EDF) and CENG. Exelon and Generation are subject to the risks that integration of CENG s nuclear fleet may not achieve anticipated
results, and that Exelon and Generation may not be able to fully integrate the operations of CENG in the manner expected.            
  A discussion of each of these risk categories and other risk factors is included below.              Market and Financial Risks           
   Generation is exposed to depressed prices in the wholesale and retail power markets, which may negatively affect its results of operations and cash flows.
(Exelon and Generation)             Generation is exposed to
commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. As such, Generation s earnings and cash flows are therefore subject to variability as spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it
operates rise and fall.             Price of Fuels : The
spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal
fuel used to generate the electricity unit. Often, the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating stations fueled by fossil fuels. Consequently, changes in the market price of fossil fuels often result in comparable changes
to the market price of power. For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on power
prices. The continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resources, such as wind and solar, whether mandated through RPS or otherwise subsidized or   
         42   

encouraged through climate legislation or regulation, may displace a higher marginal cost plant, further reducing power prices. In addition, further delay or elimination of EPA air quality
regulations could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market prices.        
   Demand and Supply:  The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of
electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs can each depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as
frequently, putting downward pressure on electricity market prices. The continued tepid economic environment and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiatives have limited the demand for electricity in Generation s markets. In
addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation, when combined with other base-load generation such as nuclear, may often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load
generating plants. The risk of increased supply in excess of demand is heightened by continued or increased RPS mandates or other subsidies, including ITCs and PTCs.   
         Retail Competition:  Generation s retail operations compete
for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In an environment of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail
competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and wholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output. Increased or more aggressive competition can
adversely affect overall gross margins and profitability in Generation s retail operations.            Sustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and cash flows, and such impacts could be emphasized given
Generation s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. These impacts could adversely affect Exelon s and Generation s ability
to fund other discretionary uses of cash such as growth projects or to pay dividends. In addition, such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations through increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs which may be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expenses. A slow recovery
in market conditions could result in a prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity prices, including low forward natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, which could also adversely affect Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.        
   In addition to price fluctuations, Generation is exposed to other risks in the power markets that are beyond its control and may negatively affect its results of
operations. (Exelon and Generation)               Credit
Risk.   In the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money, or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or
financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Generation might be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent of
amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs, the purpose of which is to spread such risk
across all market participants. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, Generation s retail sales subject it to credit
risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and   
         43   

residential customers. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a
customer s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.         
    Unstable Markets.   The wholesale spot markets remain evolving markets that vary from region to region and are still developing
practices and procedures. Problems in or the failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect
on market stability.             The Registrants are potentially exposed to emerging
technologies that may over time affect or transform the energy industry, including technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Some of these technologies include, but are not limited to further
shale gas development or sources, cost-effective renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage devices. Such developments could lower the price of energy, could affect energy deliveries as
customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, could require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution
facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants 
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or
accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.             Market performance and other factors may decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant
additional funding. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy may adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation s NDTs and
Exelon s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations
and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants  projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments may increase Generation s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. A
decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon s
pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics,
including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. If future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets or other factors cannot be recovered, or cannot be recovered in a timely manner, from ComEd, PECO and BGE
customers, the results of operations and financial positions of ComEd, PECO and BGE could be negatively affected. Ultimately, if the Registrants are unable to manage the investments with the NDT funds and benefit plan assets, and unable to manage
the related benefit plan liabilities, their results of operations, cash flows and financial positions could be negatively affected.   
         44   

Unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets may adversely affect the
Registrants  businesses in several ways, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements, the Registrants  ability to meet long-term commitments, Generation s ability to hedge effectively its
generation portfolio, and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy markets; each could adversely affect the Registrants  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly
offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from the Registrants  respective operations. Disruptions in the capital
and credit markets in the United States or abroad can adversely affect the Registrants  ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The Registrants  access to funds under their credit
facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and
liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from the Registrants and other borrowers within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer term disruptions in the capital
and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, changes to Generation s
hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral-posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash.         
  In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe. Disruptions in the European markets could reduce or
restrict the Registrants  ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 30%, or $2.5 billion, of the Registrants  available credit facilities were with European
banks. The credit facilities include $8.4 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $6.6 billion was available as of December 31, 2013. There were no borrowings under the Registrants  credit facilities as of December 31, 2013.
See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.         
  The strength and depth of competition in competitive energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could
be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that may affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that
participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could
lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on
Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and cash flows.         
   If any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its
agreements with its trading counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Generation s business is subject to credit
quality standards that may require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy
the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount
  
         45   

of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time is dependent on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature
of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Generation could experience a
downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general, or Generation in particular, has
deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation.         
  ComEd s operating agreement with PJM contains collateral provisions that are affected by its credit rating and market prices. If certain
wholesale market conditions exist and ComEd were to lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required under the PJM operating agreement to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit
or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. Collateral posting will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Given the relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral
requirements can be volatile. In addition, if ComEd were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.         
  PECO s and BGE s operating agreements with PJM and their natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected
by their credit ratings. If certain wholesale market conditions exist and PECO and BGE were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the form of
letters of credit or cash, which may have material adverse effects upon their liquidity. PECO s and BGE s collateral requirements relating to their natural gas supply contracts are a function of market prices. Collateral posting
requirements for PECO and BGE with respect to these contracts will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. Given the relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral requirements can be
volatile. In addition, if PECO or BGE were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.         
  ComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or
financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general, or ComEd, PECO, or BGE in particular, has deteriorated. ComEd, PECO or BGE could experience a downgrade if the current regulatory environments in Illinois, Pennsylvania
or Maryland, respectively, become less predictable by materially lowering returns for utilities in the applicable state or adopting other measures to mitigate higher electricity prices. Additionally, the ratings for ComEd, PECO or BGE could be
downgraded if their financial results are weakened from current levels due to weaker operating performance or due to a failure to properly manage their capital structure. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have
a negative impact on the ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE.         
  ComEd, PECO and BGE conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure
that ComEd, PECO and BGE are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate ComEd, PECO and BGE from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at
Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as  ringfencing ) may help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO and BGE in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon.
Despite these ringfencing measures, the credit ratings of ComEd, PECO or BGE could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit
rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE, or all three. A reduction in the credit rating of ComEd, PECO or BGE could have a material adverse effect on ComEd, PECO or BGE, respectively.   
         46   

See Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Market Conditions and Security Ratings for further
information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants  cash flows.             Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by price volatility, availability and other risk factors associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel. (Exelon and Generation)
            Generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to
operate its generating facilities. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. Coal, natural
gas and oil are procured for generating plants through annual, short-term and spot-market purchases. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, coal, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions and counterparty default
that may negatively affect the results of operations for Generation.         
   Generation s risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities. (Exelon and Generation)
            Generation s asset-based power position as well
as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management
procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and
estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities,
become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions may have
on its business, operating results, cash flows or financial position.            Generation buys and sells energy and other products in the wholesale markets and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation s power generation portfolio. The
proportion of hedged positions in its power generation portfolio may cause volatility in Generation s future results of operations.         
   Financial performance and load requirements may be adversely affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio. (Exelon and Generation)
            A significant portion of Generation s power
portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with ComEd, PECO, BGE and other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation s wholesale output is sold in the wholesale
power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation s financial results may be
negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio and effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.   
         Challenges to tax positions taken by the Registrants as well as tax law changes and
the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
         Corporate Tax Reform.  There exists the potential for
comprehensive tax reform in the United States that may significantly change the tax rules applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations. Exelon cannot assess what the overall effect of such potential legislation would be on its results of operations and
cash flows.   
         47   

1999 sale of fossil generating assets.   The IRS has challenged Exelon s 1999 tax
position on its like-kind exchange transaction. Exelon and the IRS failed to reach a settlement on the like-kind exchange position and Exelon filed a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the United States Tax Court. Exelon
was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the like-kind exchange position. The litigation could take three to five years including appeals, if necessary.   
        As of December 31, 2013, if the IRS is successful in its challenge
to the like-kind exchange position, Exelon s potential cash outflow, including tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable may be as much as $840 million, of which approximately $305 million would be
attributable to ComEd after consideration of Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless. In addition to attempting to impose tax on the like-kind exchange position, the IRS has asserted penalties for a substantial understatement of tax,
which could result in an after-tax charge of $87 million to Exelon s and ComEd s results of operations should the IRS prevail in asserting the penalties. The timing effects of the final resolution of the like-kind exchange matter are
unknown. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
    Tax reserves and the recoverability of deferred tax assets.   The Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their
obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes
regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. The Registrants also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards and tax credits. See Notes 1 and
14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Increases in customer rates and the impact of economic downturns may lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. Additionally, increased rates could lead to decreased volumes delivered. Both of
these factors may decrease Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results from operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s current procurement plans
include purchasing power through contracted suppliers and in the spot market. ComEd s and PECO s costs of purchased power are charged to customers without a return or profit component. BGE s SOS rates charged to customers recover
BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee which includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component. For PECO, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers with no return or profit
component. For BGE, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers using a MBR mechanism that compares the actual cost of gas to a market index. The difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders
and customers. Purchased power and natural gas prices fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand. Significantly higher rates related to purchased power and natural gas can result in declines in customer usage, lower revenues and potentially
additional uncollectible accounts expense for ComEd, PECO and BGE. In addition, any challenges by the regulators or ComEd, PECO and BGE as to the recoverability of these costs could have a material effect on the Registrants  results of
operations and cash flows. Also, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers.   
        Further, the impacts of economic downturns on ComEd, PECO and BGE
customers and purchased natural gas costs for PECO and BGE customers, such as unemployment for residential customers and less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on
residential service terminations, may result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances, which would negatively impact ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results from operations and cash flows. Generation s customer
supply activities   
         48   

face economic downturn risks similar to Exelon s utility businesses, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances. As Generation increases its
customer supply footprint, economic downturn impacts could negatively affect Generation s results from operations and cash flows. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for further discussion of the
Registrants  credit risk.             The effects of weather may impact the
Registrants  results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels
in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Moderate temperatures adversely
affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at ComEd and PECO. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE recognizes revenues at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a billing period, and is not
affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms may stress ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s transmission and distribution systems, communication systems and
technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company s ability to meet peak customer demand. These extreme conditions may have detrimental effects on ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of
operations and cash flows. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and may make period comparisons less relevant.            Generation s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating
conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation may require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms may affect the availability of
generation and its transmission, limiting Generation s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage can impact Generation s ability to run certain generating assets at full
capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may have an adverse effect by causing Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are
weak.             Certain long-lived assets and other assets recorded on the
Registrants  statements of financial position may become impaired, which would result in write-offs of the impaired amounts. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the
Registrants  statement of financial position. Specifically, long-lived assets account for 59%, 49%, 61%, 66% and 75% of total assets for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. In addition, the
Registrants have significant balances related to unamortized energy contracts. See Notes 4 and 10 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Exelon s unamortized energy contracts. The Registrants
evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as the business climate, including current and future energy and market
conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment. An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset through a
non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment, and such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations.   
        Exelon and Generation have investments in certain generating plant
projects, including the CENG nuclear joint venture with a carrying value of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. These investments   
         49   

were acquired in the March 2012 Constellation transaction, and were recorded as equity method investments on the balance sheet at fair value on the merger date as part of purchase accounting.
Exelon and Generation continuously monitor for issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these equity method investments and which could result in the recognition of an impairment loss if such issues indicate an other than
temporary decline in value. Such impairment could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations.         
  Exelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia and Texas subject to long-term leases. The investments are accounted for as direct
financing lease investments. The investments represent the estimated residual values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease
investments and records a non-cash impairment charge to expense if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying values. Such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on
Exelon s results of operations.            Exelon and ComEd had
approximately $2.6 billion of goodwill recorded at December 31, 2013 in connection with the merger between PECO and Unicom Corporation, the former parent company of ComEd. Under GAAP, goodwill remains at its recorded amount unless it is
determined to be impaired, which is generally based upon an annual analysis that compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the impaired goodwill will be written-off, reducing
equity. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments will depend on many sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables. A successful IRS challenge to Exelon s and ComEd s like-kind exchange income tax position, adverse
regulatory actions such as early termination of EIMA, or changes in significant assumptions used in estimating ComEd s fair value (e.g., discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, operating and capital
expenditure requirements and the fair value of debt) could result in an impairment. Such an impairment would result in a non-cash charge to expense, which could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and ComEd s results of operations.
           See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Notes 7, 8 and 10 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on long-lived asset and goodwill
impairments.             The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive, and
their assets may require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in energy
generation and by ComEd, PECO and BGE in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years. Older equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility
practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants  control, and may require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants  results of operations, financial condition, or cash
flows could be adversely affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. Furthermore, operational failure could result in potential liability if such failure results in damage to property or
injury to individuals. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS for further information regarding the Registrants  potential future capital expenditures.   
         50   

Exelon and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs
in the event of non-performance by third parties. In addition, the Registrants have rights under agreements which obligate third parties to indemnify the Registrants for various obligations, and the Registrants may incur substantial costs in the
event that the applicable Registrant is unable to enforce those agreements or the applicable third-party is otherwise unable to perform. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate one or more of the Registrants
or their subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such
performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.         
  The Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it
harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could
be held responsible for the obligations, which could impact that Registrant s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed certain of ComEd s
and PECO s rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd and PECO may have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd or PECO for certain
obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party or Generation experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity
arrangement became unenforceable, ComEd or PECO could be liable for any existing or future claims, which could impact ComEd s or PECO s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
         Generation s business may be negatively affected by competitive electric
generation suppliers. (Exelon and Generation)             Because
retail customers where Generation serves load can switch from their respective energy delivery company to a competitive electric generation supplier for their energy needs, planning to meet Generation s obligation to provide the supply needed
to serve Generation s share of an electric distribution company s default service obligation is more difficult than planning for retail load before the advent of retail competition. Before retail competition, the primary variables
affecting projections of load were weather and the economy. With retail competition, another major factor is retail customers switching to or from competitive electric generation suppliers. If fewer of such customers switch from its retail load
serving counterparties than Generation anticipates, the load that Generation must serve will be greater than anticipated, which could, if market prices have increased, increase Generation s costs (due to its need to go to market to cover its
incremental supply obligation) more than the increase in Generation s revenues. If more customers from its retail load serving counterparties switch than Generation anticipates, the load that Generation must serve will be lower than
anticipated, which could, if market prices have decreased, cause Generation to lose opportunities in the market.              Regulatory and Legislative Risks               The Registrants  generation and energy delivery businesses are highly regulated and could be subject to adverse regulatory and legislative actions. Fundamental changes in regulation or legislation or
violation of tariffs or market rules and anti-manipulation laws, could disrupt the Registrants  business plans and adversely affect their operations and financial results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Substantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are
subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation. Further, Exelon s and Generation s operating results and   
         51   

cash flows are heavily dependent upon the ability of Generation to sell power at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates, and Exelon s, ComEd s,
PECO s and BGE s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customers. Similarly, there is risk that
financial market regulations could increase the Registrants  compliance costs and limit their ability to engage in certain transactions. In the planning and management of operations, the Registrants must address the effects of regulation on
their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by Federal and state legislatures, RTOs, exchanges, ratemaking agencies and taxing authorities. Additionally, the Registrants need to be cognizant of rules changes or
Registrant actions that could result in potential violation of tariffs, market rules and anti-manipulation laws. Fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants  businesses would require changes
in their business planning models and operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.         
  Regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change and RPS may also significantly affect Exelon s and Generation s results
of operations, cash flows and financial positions. Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change through GHG emission reductions, if enacted, could result in increased costs to entities that generate electricity through
carbon-emitting fossil fuels, which could increase the market price at which all generators in a region, including Generation, may sell their output, thereby increasing the revenue Generation could realize from its low-carbon nuclear assets.
However, national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an RPS could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities in the Midwest, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity
from Generation s Midwest nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets under a carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. Current
state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentives for regional wind development. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what
their effect will be on the Registrants.             Generation may be negatively
affected by possible Federal or state legislative or regulatory actions that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets. (Exelon and Generation)    
        Federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are facing
pressures to address consumer concerns, or are themselves raising concerns, that energy prices in wholesale markets are too high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working, and, therefore, are considering
some form of re-regulation or some other means of reducing wholesale market prices or subsidizing new generation. Generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy markets to achieve its business objectives.   
        Approximately 60% of Generation s generating resources, which
include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation s future results of operations will depend on 1) FERC s continued adherence to and support for,
policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets, such as PJM s, and (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competitiveness. Generation
could also be adversely affected by state laws, regulations or initiatives designed to reduce wholesale prices artificially below competitive levels or to subsidize new generation, such as the subsequently dismissed New Jersey Capacity Legislation
and the MDPSC s RFP for new gas-fired generation in Maryland. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the New Jersey Capacity Legislation and the Maryland new electric generation
requirements.            In addition, FERC s application of its
Order 697 and its subsequent revisions could pose a risk that Generation will have difficulty satisfying FERC s tests for market-based rates. Since Order 697 became   
         52   

final in June 2007, Generation has obtained orders affirming Generation s authority to sell at market-based rates and none denying that authority. On December 31, 2013, Generation
submitted its triennial application seeking reauthorization to sell at market-based rates in the Northeast region (including PJM, ISO-NY and ISONE). Generation s previous submission seeking reauthorization to sell at market-based rates was
accepted by FERC on June 22, 2011 for the PJM region.         
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was enacted into law on July 21, 2010. Its primary objective is to
eliminate from the financial system the systemic risk that Congress believed was in part the cause of the financial crisis that unfolded during 2008. Dodd-Frank ushers in a brand new regulatory regime applicable to the over-the-counter (OTC) market
for swaps. Generation relies on the OTC swaps markets as part of its program to hedge the price risk associated with its generation portfolio. In April 2012, the CFTC issued its rule defining swap dealers and major swap participants. Generation has
determined that it will conduct its commercial hedging business as an end user in a manner that does not require registration as a swap dealer or major swap participant.   
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Generation will still face additional
regulatory obligations under Dodd-Frank, including some reporting requirements, clearing some additional transactions that it would otherwise enter into over-the-counter, and having to adhere to position limits. More fundamentally, however, the
total burden that the rules could impose on all market participants could cause liquidity in the bilateral OTC swaps market to decrease substantially. Dodd-Frank may require up to $1 billion of additional collateral requirements at Generation, to be
met with cash rather than letters of credit in a price stressed environment. Generation continues to monitor the rulemaking procedures and cannot predict the ultimate outcome that the financial reform legislation will have on its results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.             Generation s
affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation s physical asset base within the ComEd, PECO and BGE service territories, could increase Generation s cost of doing business to the
extent future complaints or challenges regarding ComEd, PECO and/or BGE retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation. (Exelon and Generation)    
        Generation has significant generating resources within the service
areas of ComEd, PECO and BGE and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of
Generation s affiliation with ComEd, PECO and BGE and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups may question
or challenge costs incurred by ComEd, PECO or BGE, including transactions between Generation, on the one hand, and ComEd, PECO or BGE, on the other hand, regardless of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The
prospect of such challenges may increase the time, complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges may subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those
markets. In addition, government officials and legislators may seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes and contributions to rate-relief
packages.             The Registrants may incur substantial costs to fulfill their
obligations related to environmental and other matters. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The businesses which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal
authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of these emission and
disposal   
         53   

requirements can subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs,
civil penalties and exposure to third parties  claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for
environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Registrants have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental
compliance, site remediation and clean-up. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to
sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.         
  If application of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic
organisms at existing generating stations, requires the retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this development could result in material costs of compliance. Pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP
regarding the application of Section 316(b) to Oyster Creek, Generation agreed to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its operating license in 2029.   
        Additionally, Generation is subject to exposure for asbestos-related
personal injury liability alleged at certain current and formerly owned generation facilities. Future legislative action could require Generation to make a material contribution to a fund to settle lawsuits for alleged asbestos-related disease
and exposure.            In some cases, a third-party who has acquired
assets from a Registrant has assumed the liability the Registrant may otherwise have for environmental matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee is unable, or fails, to discharge the assumed liability, a regulatory authority or
injured person could attempt to hold the Registrant responsible, and the Registrant s remedies against the transferee may be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.             Changes in ComEd s,
PECO s and BGE s respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which
lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which may introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  ComEd, PECO and BGE are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their
respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of
limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The proceedings generally have timelines that may not be limited by statute. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The
potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for ComEd, PECO or BGE to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are
also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates can be adjusted, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, MGP remediation, smart grid
infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.            In certain instances, ComEd, PECO and BGE may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.
  
         54   

ComEd, PECO and BGE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by
Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland or Federal regulators in establishing rates, including the extent, if any, to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed. Nevertheless, the
expectation is that ComEd, PECO and BGE will continue to be obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and will also retain significant POLR and default service obligations to provide electricity and
natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose an alternative supplier. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE,
as applicable, to recover their costs and could have a material adverse effect on ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information regarding rate proceedings.             Federal or
additional state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers, could negatively affect the results of operations and cash flows of Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Changes to current state legislation or the
development of Federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, especially if timely cost recovery is not
allowed. The impact could include increased costs for RECs and purchased power and increased rates for customers.         
  Federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such
as smart meters and smart grid, have increased capital expenditures and could significantly impact ComEd, PECO and BGE, if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer
energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO. For additional information, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Environmental
Regulation-Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards.          
   The impact of not meeting the criteria of the FASB guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation could be material to Exelon, ComEd,
PECO and BGE. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             As of
December 31, 2013, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE have concluded that the operations of ComEd, PECO and BGE meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. If it is concluded in a
future period that a separable portion of their businesses no longer meets the criteria, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE would be required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of their business. That action would
include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in their Consolidated Balance Sheets and the recognition of a one-time extraordinary item in their Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of
not meeting the criteria of the authoritative guidance could be material to the financial statements of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE. At December 31, 2013, the extraordinary gain (loss) could have been as much as $(2.4) billion, $730 million and
$ 453 million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively. Further, Exelon would record a charge against OCI (before taxes) of up to $2.4 billion and
$568 million for ComEd and BGE, respectively, related to Exelon s regulatory assets associated with its defined benefit postretirement plans. Exelon also has a regulatory liability of $45 million (before taxes) associated with PECO s
defined benefit postretirement plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed. The impacts and resolution of the above items could lead to an additional impairment of ComEd s goodwill, which could be significant and at least
partially offset the extraordinary gain at ComEd discussed above. A significant decrease in equity as a result of any changes could limit the ability of ComEd, PECO and BGE to pay dividends under Federal
  
         55   

and state law and no longer meeting the regulatory accounting criteria could cause significant volatility in future results of operations. See Notes 1, 3 and 10 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounting for the effects of regulation, regulatory matters and ComEd s goodwill, respectively.   
         Exelon and Generation may incur material costs of compliance if Federal and/or state
regulation or legislation is adopted to address climate change. (Exelon and Generation)          
  Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other
companies in many business sectors, including utilities, are considering ways to address the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. In 2009, select Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states implemented a model rule, developed via the RGGI, to regulate
CO   2    emissions from fossil-fired generation. RGGI states are working on updated
programs to further limit emissions and the EPA has introduced regulation to address greenhouse gases from new fossil plants that could potentially impact existing plants. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, Exelon and
Generation may incur costs either to limit further the GHG emissions from their operations or to procure emission allowance credits. The nature and extent of environmental regulation may also impact the ability of Exelon and its subsidiaries to meet
the GHG emission reduction targets of Exelon 2020. For example, more stringent permitting requirements may preclude the construction of lower-carbon nuclear and gas-fired power plants. Similarly, a Federal RPS could increase the cost of compliance
by mandating the purchase or construction of more expensive supply alternatives. For more information regarding climate change, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Global Climate Change  and Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.             The Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or
penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of ComEd, PECO, and BGE to the results of PJM s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and
operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. As operators of natural gas distribution systems, PECO and BGE are
also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market
interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards may subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC impose certain distribution reliability
standards on ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary
penalties.            ComEd, PECO and BGE as transmission owners are
subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments may require ComEd, PECO and BGE to incur incremental capital or operating and
maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards. Uncertainties exist as to the construction of new transmission facilities, their cost and how those costs will be allocated to transmission system participants and
customers. In accordance with a FERC order and related settlement, PJM s RTEP requires the costs of new transmission facilities to be allocated across the entire PJM footprint for new facilities greater than or equal to 500 kV, and requires
costs of new facilities less than 500 kV to be allocated to the beneficiaries of the new facilities. Following a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, FERC reaffirmed its decision related to allocation of new facilities 500
kV and above. That decision is being appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. This FERC order only applies to facilities included in the PJM RTEP   
         56   

prior to February 1, 2013. For facilities subsequently approved, the costs of new facilities that are double circuit 345 kV or greater than or equal to 500 kV will be allocated 50% across
the entire PJM footprint and 50% allocated to identified beneficiaries. Costs for all other facilities will be allocated to all identified beneficiaries. This later decision is subject to rehearing by FERC and possible appeal.   
        See Notes 3 and 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.             The Registrants cannot predict
the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to their business activities. An adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)             The Registrants are involved in legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of their business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require
significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants  results of operations.             Generation may be negatively affected by possible Nuclear Regulatory Commission actions that could affect the operations and profitability of its nuclear generating fleet. (Exelon and Generation)    
          Regulatory risk   .  A change in the Atomic Energy
Act or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial
position. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions.         
  As an example, prior to the Fukushima Daiichi accident on March 11, 2011, the NRC had been evaluating seismic risk. After the Fukushima Daiichi
accident, the NRC s focus on seismic risk intensified. As part of the NRC Near-Term Task Force (Task Force) review and evaluation of the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the Task Force recommended that plant operators conduct seismic reevaluations.
In January 2012, the NRC released an updated seismic risk model that plant operators must use in performing the seismic reevaluations recommended by the Task Force. These reevaluations could result in the required implementation of additional
mitigation strategies or modifications. Additionally, the Task Force provided recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. In response, the NRC issued three immediately effective orders (Tier 1) to
commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States for compliance no later than December 31, 2016. The NRC is currently evaluating the remaining Task Force recommendations and has not taken action with respect to the Tier 2 and Tier 3
recommendations. Actions to comply with the Task Force recommendations will result in increased costs and could significantly impact Generation s results of operations or financial position. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview for a more detailed discussion of the Task Force Recommendations.   
          Spent nuclear fuel storage.   The approval of a national
repository for the storage of SNF, such as the one previously considered at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from
the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs. The NRC s temporary storage rule (also referred to as the  waste confidence decision ) recognizes that licensees can safely store spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power plants for up to 60
years beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants. In June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit vacated the NRC s temporary storage rule on the grounds that the NRC should have conducted a more
comprehensive   
         57   

environmental review to support the rule. In September 2012, the NRC directed NRC Staff to complete a generic environmental impact statement and to revise the temporary storage rule which is now
not expected until October 3, 2014.            Any regulatory
action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF may adversely affect Generation s ability to decommission fully its nuclear units. In accordance with the NWPA and Generation s contract with the DOE, Generation pays
the DOE ongoing fees per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. This fee may be adjusted prospectively in order to ensure full cost recovery. On November 19, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Generation must continue to
pay the current SNF disposal fees. Furthermore, under its contract with the DOE, Generation would be required to pay the DOE a one-time SNF storage fee including interest of approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2013, prior to the first
delivery of SNF. Generation currently estimates 2025 to be the earliest date when the DOE will begin accepting SNF, which could be delayed by further regulatory action. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the spent nuclear fuel obligation.         
    License renewals.   Generation cannot assure that economics will support the continued operation of the facilities for all or any
portion of any renewed license period. If the NRC does not renew the operating licenses for Generation s nuclear stations or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could be
adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. In
addition, Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.         
  As discussed above, in June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit vacated the NRC s temporary storage rule. Generation
does not expect the NRC to issue license renewals until the end of 2014, at the earliest.              Operational Risks               The
Registrants  employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Employees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and
customers and the general public may be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near their operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at risk for serious injury, including loss of
life. Significant risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.        
   Natural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events may adversely affect Exelon s results of operations, its
ability to raise capital and its future growth. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Generation s fleet of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plants and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters, such as seismic
activity, more frequent and more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, sea level rise and other related phenomena. Severe weather or other natural disasters could
be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants  service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers
  
         58   

due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. Examples of such events include the June 2012  Derecho  storm, which interrupted electric service delivery to
customers in BGE s service territory, and the October 2012 category 1 hurricane, Hurricane Sandy, which interrupted electric service delivery to customers in PECO s and BGE s service territories and resulted in significant costs to
PECO and BGE for restoration efforts.            Other events include
the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami experienced by Japan on March 11, 2011, that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co., and the 5.8
magnitude earthquake and flooding associated with Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee that the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States experienced in 2011. These events increase the risk to Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or
legislative bodies may change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects. In
addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units. Additionally, natural
disasters and other events that have an adverse effect on the economy in general may adversely affect the Registrants  operations and their ability to raise capital.   
        Exelon does not know the impact that potential terrorist attacks could
have on the industry in general and on Exelon in particular. As owner-operators of infrastructure facilities, such as nuclear, fossil and hydroelectric generation facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities, the
Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes
in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cyber security of Exelon s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon s
ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors also may result in a decline in energy consumption, which may
adversely affect the Registrants  results of operations and its ability to raise capital. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.   
        The Registrants would be significantly affected by the outbreak of a
pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate its generating and transmission and
distribution assets could be affected, resulting in decreased service levels and increased costs.            In addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that may damage or
destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.   
         Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by matters
arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities. (Exelon and Generation)               Nuclear capacity factors.   Capacity factors for generating units, particularly capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation s results of operations. Nuclear
plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs but produce electricity at low variable costs due to nuclear fuel costs typically being lower than fossil fuel costs. Consequently, to be successful, Generation must consistently operate its
nuclear facilities at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase Generation s operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil   
         59   

facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation s obligations to committed third-party sales, including ComEd, PECO and BGE. These
sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.         
    Nuclear refueling outages.   In general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of
refueling outages, along with their duration, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. When refueling outages at wholly and co-owned plants last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages,
capacity factors decrease and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales.         
    Nuclear fuel quality   .  The quality of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation can affect the efficiency and costs of
Generation s operations. Certain of Generation s nuclear units have previously had a limited number of fuel performance issues. Remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage
costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.              Operational risk   .  Operations at any of Generation s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation has to shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity.
If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. Generation may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event,
Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, Generation may not achieve the anticipated results under its series of planned power uprates across its nuclear fleet. For
plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation may also incur liability to the co-owners. For plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from which Generation receives a portion of the plants  output,
Generation s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. Additionally, poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by
Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy, which could significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial position. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by
others, or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by Generation.   
          Nuclear major incident risk.   Although the safety record
of nuclear reactors generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the United States and abroad. The consequences of a major incident can be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any
resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, may exceed Generation s resources, including insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the
extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation and could have a material adverse effect on Generation s results of operations or financial position. Additionally, an accident or other significant event
at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, owned by others or Generation, may result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or
financial position.              Nuclear insurance.   As
required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance. The required amount of nuclear liability insurance is $375 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered
through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $13.6 billion limit for a single incident.   
        Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL,
which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation s nuclear operations. In previous years, NEIL has   
         60   

made distributions to its members but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will occur at all. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of nuclear insurance.         
    Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds
will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for Generation s two units that have been
retired) addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC-estimated funding levels including scheduled contributions to and earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. The NRC funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning
will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.            Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. The performance of
capital markets also can significantly affect the value of the trust funds. Currently, Generation is making contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to
Generation. While Generation has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from ComEd customers or from the previous owners of
Clinton, TMI Unit No. 1 and Oyster Creek generating stations, if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of
the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds
related to the former PECO units may be negatively affected and Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be significantly affected. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.            Ultimately, if the investments
held by Generation s NDTs are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation s nuclear plants, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company
guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Generation s cash flows
and financial position may be significantly adversely affected. See Note 15 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by risks arising
from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities. (Exelon and Generation)             FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Conowingo
Hydroelectric Project expires August 31, 2014, and the license for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Project expires on September 1, 2014. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses
of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could be
adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. Generation may also
lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions may be imposed as part of the license renewal process that may adversely affect operations, may require a substantial increase in
capital expenditures or may result in increased operating costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial   
         61   

position. Similar effects may result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by
Generation.             ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s operating costs,
and customers  and regulators  opinions of ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems. (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Failures of the equipment or facilities, including
information systems, used in ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s delivery systems can interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could negatively impact related revenues, and increase maintenance and
capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, smart grid or other technologies in
ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial results could be adversely
affected. If an employee causes the operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating the operational systems, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial results could also
be adversely affected. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.   
        The aforementioned failures or those of other utilities, including
prolonged or repeated failures, can affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s maintenance and capital expenditures. Regulated utilities, which are required to provide service to
all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd can be required to pay damages to its customers in some
circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, and those damages could be material to ComEd s results of operations and cash flows. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding proceedings related to storm-related outages in ComEd s service territory.             ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs and their capital expenditures may be negatively affected by transmission congestion. (Exelon, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             Demand for electricity within
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations.
Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all
utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring ComEd, PECO and BGE to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.
            Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce may
negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate
replacements, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time   
         62   

period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may arise. The Registrants are
particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and distribution operations. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately
qualified workforce, their results of operations could be negatively affected.             The Registrants are subject to physical and information security risks. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants face physical and information security risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A
security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or
subject the Registrants to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer data. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of Exelon and its customer supply
activities may be adversely affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry may be diminished, or Exelon and its subsidiaries may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a
negative impact on the business and/or results of operations. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories may increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by
third parties. As a requirement of their SGIG grant, the DOE approved PECO s and BGE s cyber security plan related to its smart meter deployment and will review the plan annually through the expiration of the grant. As with most companies
in today s environment, Exelon experiences attempts by hackers to infiltrate its corporate network. To date there have been no infiltrations that have resulted in loss of data or any significant effects on business operations. Exelon
utilizes a dedicated team of cyber security professionals to ensure the protection of its information and ability to conduct business operations. Despite the measures taken by the Registrants to prevent a security breach, the Registrants cannot
accurately assess the probability that a security breach may occur and are unable to quantify the potential impact of such an event. In addition, new or updated security regulations could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants
or their business operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.         
   The Registrants may make investments in new business initiatives, including initiatives mandated by regulators, and markets that may not be successful, and
acquisitions may not achieve the intended financial results. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Generation continuously looks to invest in new business initiatives and actively participate in new markets. These include, but are not limited to,
unconventional oil and gas exploration and production, residential power and gas sales, solar and wind generation, and managed load response. Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from
current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. As these markets mature, there may be new market entrants or expansion by
established competitors that increase competition for customers and resources. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others may impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could
result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment. ComEd, PECO and BGE face risks associated with the Smart Grid mandated regulatory initiative. These risks include, but are not limited to,
cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cyber security and obsolescence of technology. Due to these risks, no assurance can be given that such initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on ComEd s, PECO s or
BGE s financial results.   
         63   

Risks Related to the Merger     
         Exelon may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting commitments it
made under various orders and agreements associated with regulatory approvals for the Constellation merger.          
  As a result of the process to obtain regulatory approvals required for the Constellation merger, Exelon is committed to various programs,
contributions, investments and market mitigation measures in several settlement agreements and regulatory approval orders. It is possible that Exelon may encounter delays, unexpected difficulties or costs in meeting these commitments in compliance
with the terms of the relevant agreements and orders. Failure to fulfill the commitments in accordance with their terms could result in increased costs or result in penalties or fines that could adversely affect Exelon s financial position and
operating results.              Risks Related to the Pending Master Agreement with
CENG               The integration of CENG s nuclear fleet may not
achieve its anticipated results, and Exelon and Generation may not be able to fully integrate the operations of CENG in the manner expected.          
  Exelon, Generation and subsidiaries of Generation entered into a Master Agreement with EDF, EDF Inc. (EDFI) (a subsidiary of EDF) and CENG that will
result in Generation operating the CENG nuclear generation fleet. The Master Agreement was entered into with the expectation that it will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving
the anticipated benefits of the agreement is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether CENG can be integrated into Generation in an efficient, effective and timely manner. Integration will take place, and additional agreements will be
signed, upon receipt of regulatory approvals for the transfer of CENG s nuclear operating licences to Generation.         
  It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of
Generation s business, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, valuation models, and compensation arrangements. In addition, Generation may have difficulty addressing possible
differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect Generation s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the agreement as and when expected. Failure to achieve these
anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect Generation s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

(a)  
  All nuclear stations are boiling water reactors except Braidwood, Byron, Calvert Cliffs, Ginna, Salem and Three Mile Island, which are pressurized water reactors.

(c)  
  Base-load units are plants that normally operate to take all or part of the minimum continuous load of a system and, consequently, produce electricity at an essentially constant
rate. Intermediate units are plants that normally operate to take load of a system during the daytime higher load hours and, consequently, produce electricity by cycling on and off daily. Peaking units consist of lower-efficiency, quick response
steam units, gas turbines and diesels normally used during the maximum load periods.     

(d)  
  For nuclear stations, capacity reflects the annual mean rating. Fossil stations reflect a summer rating. Wind and solar facilities reflect name plate capacity.

(e)  
  Generation has agreed to permanently cease generation operation at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019.     

(f)  
  Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share.     

(g)  
  Expected capacity upon project completion is 230MW. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(h)  
  Reflects Generation s 50.01% interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF. For Nine Mile Point, the co-owner owns 18% of Unit 2. Thus Exelon s ownership is 50.01% of 82%
of Nine Mile Point Unit 2. Generation also has a unit-contingent PPA with CENG under which it purchases 85% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG that is not sold to third parties under the pre-existing PPAs through 2014.

(i)  
  In February 2014, Generation sold its remaining stake in Malacha.           
  The net generation capability available for operation at any time may be less due to regulatory restrictions, transmission congestion, fuel
restrictions, efficiency of cooling facilities, level of water supplies or generating units being temporarily out of service for inspection, maintenance, refueling, repairs or modifications required by regulatory authorities.   
        Generation maintains property insurance against loss or damage to its
principal plants and properties by fire or other perils, subject to certain exceptions. For additional information regarding nuclear insurance of generating facilities, see ITEM 1. Business Generation. For its insured losses, Generation is
self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Generation s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

included in capital account  is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly
disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not
believe these limitations are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.            Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and
earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with a financing arranged through ComEd
Financing III that ComEd will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III;
(2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No
such event has occurred.            PECO has agreed in connection with
financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated
debentures which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an
event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has occurred.         
  BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares
through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents
or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30
days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common   
         73   

stock dividends unless: (1) BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any
dividends (and any redemption payments) due on BGE s preference stock have not been paid.            At December 31, 2013, Exelon had retained earnings of $10,358 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $3,613 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $750 million consisting of
retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,389 million, partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficits, PECO s retained earnings of $649 million, and BGE s retained earnings of $1,005 million.

dividends per share paid during 2013 and 2012:         
          The following table sets forth
Generation s quarterly distributions and ComEd s and PECO s quarterly common dividend payments:         
            First Quarter 2014 Dividend.
  On January 28, 2014, the Exelon Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2014 regular quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share on Exelon s common stock payable on March 10, 2014, to shareholders of record of Exelon at the
end of the day on February 14, 2014.

Item 7.   
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                  Exelon          
     Executive Overview          
  Exelon, a utility services holding company, operates through the following principal subsidiaries:   

Generation,  whose integrated business consists of owned, contracted and investments in electric generating facilities managed through customer supply of
electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products, risk management services and natural gas exploration and production activities.            

ComEd,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in
northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.            

PECO,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in
southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.

BGE,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in
central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.      
        Exelon has nine reportable segments consisting of Generation s six
power marketing reportable segments (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Regions in Generation), ComEd, PECO and BGE. See Note 24 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding Exelon s reportable segments.            Through its
business services subsidiary BSC, Exelon provides its operating subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost. The costs of these services are directly charged or allocated to the applicable operating segments. Additionally, the results of
Exelon s corporate operations include costs for corporate governance and interest costs and income from various investment and financing activities.         
  Exelon s consolidated financial information includes the results of its four separate operating subsidiary registrants, Generation, ComEd, PECO
and BGE, which, along with Exelon, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. The following combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE. However, none of the Registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other Registrants.         
    Financial Results.   The following consolidated financial results reflect the results of Exelon for year ended December 31, 2013
compared to the same period in 2012. The 2012 financial results only include the operations of Constellation and BGE from the date of the merger with Constellation (the Merger), March 12, 2012, through December 31, 2012. All amounts
presented below are before the impact of income taxes, except as noted.            Results in 2013 were unfavorably impacted at Generation by continuing declines in realized power and gas prices, in part driven by the abundance of natural gas supply, continued sluggish demand and subsidized
renewable generation; only partially offset by improved returns at the utilities, and the   
         78   

realization of additional post-merger synergies and operational excellence across all businesses. Generation s financial results continue to be challenged by low natural gas prices, and by
the impacts of excess generation from subsidized renewable energy, flat load growth and distorted market designs, especially in its Midwest markets.         

(a)  
  The Registrants  evaluate operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. The Registrants  believe that revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not
be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.           
  Exelon s net income on common stock was $1,719 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $1,160 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012, and diluted earnings per average common share were $ 2.00 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $1.42 for the year ended December 31, 2012.   
        Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a
non-GAAP measure discussed below, increased by $832 million as compared to 2012. The year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense reflects the inclusion of Constellation and BGE s results for the full
period in 2013 and was primarily due to the following favorable factors:         

Decrease in Generation s amortization expense for the acquired energy contracts recorded at fair value at the merger date of $610 million;
     
         79   

Increase in BGE s revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense of $278 million, primarily as a result of the inclusion of BGE s results for the full
period in 2013, accrual of the residential customer rate credit that was a condition of the MDPSC s approval of Exelon s merger with Constellation in 2012, and the impact of the MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate
increases that became effective February 23, 2013;            

Increase in Generation s revenue net of purchased power and fuel of $159 million on other activities, including proprietary trading, retail gas, energy
efficiency, energy management and demand response, upstream natural gas and the design and construction of customer sited solar facilities, primarily due to the addition of Constellation; and      

Increase in ComEd s revenue net of purchased power expense of $154 million primarily due to increased distribution revenue due to recovery of increased
costs and capital investment and higher allowed ROE pursuant to the formula rate under EIMA and the enactment of Senate Bill 9.            
  The year-over-year increase in operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:

Decrease in Generation s electric revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense of $565 million primarily due to lower realized energy prices, lower
load volume and increased nuclear fuel expense, partially offset by higher capacity revenue, increased nuclear volumes, and lower energy supply costs as a result of the integration of the energy generation and load serving businesses following the
merger;            

Reduced revenue net of purchased power and fuel at Generation of $136 million in 2013 associated with the Maryland Clean Coal assets that were sold in November
2012 and lost compensation on the reliability-must-run program with PJM for retired fossil generating assets that expired on May 31, 2012; and      

Decrease in PECO s revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense of $11 million primarily due to the decrease in effective rates due to increased usage
per customer across all customer classes, decreased cost recovery for energy efficiency and demand response programs, decreased gross receipts tax revenue, and the customer refund in 2013 of the tax cash benefit related to gas property distribution
repairs.               Operating and maintenance
expense decreased by $691 million as compared to 2012 primarily due to the following favorable factors:         

Decrease in operating and maintenance expense associated with the generating assets retired or divested during 2012 of $442 million;

Costs incurred in March 2012 of $216 million and $195 million as part of the Maryland order approving the merger and a settlement with the FERC, respectively;

Decrease in uncollectible accounts expense of $58 million at ComEd resulting from the timing of regulatory cost recovery and customers purchasing electricity
from competitive electric generation suppliers.               The year-over-year decrease in operating and maintenance expense was partially offset by the following unfavorable factors:         

Increase in labor, other benefits, contracting and materials costs of $298 million, primarily due to the addition of BGE and Constellation for the full period in
2013; and            

Long-lived asset impairments and related charges of $174 million in 2013, primarily related to Generation s cancellation of nuclear uprate projects and the
impairment of certain wind generating assets.      
         80   

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $272 million primarily due to the addition of BGE
and Constellation for the full period in 2013, BGE s and Constellation s plant balances in 2012, ongoing capital expenditures across the operating companies, the completion of wind and solar facilities placed into service in the second
half of 2012 and in 2013 at Generation, and increased regulatory asset amortization related to higher MGP remediation expenditures and higher costs for energy efficiency and demand response programs at ComEd and BGE, respectively.   
        The favorable increase in Equity in earnings/loss of unconsolidated
affiliates of $101 million was primarily due to higher net income from Generation s equity investment in CENG in 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and lower amortization of the basis difference of Generation s ownership interest in
CENG recorded at fair value in connection with the merger.         
  Interest expense increased by $428 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense at ComEd related to the remeasurement of Exelon s
like-kind exchange tax position in the first quarter of 2013, an increase in debt obligations as a result of the merger and an increase in project financing at Generation in 2013.   
        Exelon s effective income tax rates for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.6% and 34.9%, respectively. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.   
        For further detail regarding the financial results for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, including explanation of the non-GAAP measure revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the discussions of Results of Operations by Segment below.              Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings     
        Exelon s adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year
ended December 31, 2013 were $2,149 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2,330 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, for the same period in 2012. In addition to net income, Exelon
evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings
exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon s baseline
operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating
performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other
companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.   
         81   

The following table provides a reconciliation between net income as determined in accordance with GAAP
and adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012:         

(a)  
  Reflects the impact of (gains) losses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, on Generation s economic hedging activities (net of taxes of $201
million and $200 million, respectively). In order to better align the impacts of economic hedging with the underlying business activity (e.g. the sale of power and/or the use of fuel), these unrealized (gains) losses are excluded from operating
earnings until the transactions are realized. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to Generation s hedging activities.

(b)  
  Reflects the impact of unrealized gains for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, on Generation s NDT fund investments for Non-Regulatory Agreement
Units (net of taxes of $(144) million and $(132) million, respectively). See Note 15 Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to Generation s NDT fund investments.

(c)  
  Reflects the impacts associated with the sale or retirement of generating stations in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (net of taxes of $4 million and $106
million, respectively). See  Results of Operations Generation  for additional detail related to the generating unit retirements.     

(d)  
  Primarily reflects the impact of an increase in Generation s asset retirement obligation for asbestos at retired fossil plants for the year ended December 31, 2013 (net
of taxes of $(5) million). Primarily reflects the impact of an increase in Generation s decommissioning obligation for spent nuclear fuel at retired nuclear units for the year ended December 31, 2012 (net of taxes of $(1) million).

(e)  
  Reflects certain costs incurred in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (net of taxes of $33 million and $161 million, respectively) associated with the merger,
including employee-related expenses (e.g. severance, retirement, relocation and retention bonuses) integration initiatives, certain pre-acquisition contingencies, and CENG transaction costs, partially offset in 2013 by a one-time benefit pursuant to
the BGE 2012 electric and gas distribution rate case order for the recovery of previously incurred integration costs. See Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(f)  
  Reflects certain costs incurred in the year ended 2012 associated with various acquisitions (net of taxes of $2 million).     

(g)  
  Reflects the non-cash impacts of the remeasurement of state deferred income taxes, primarily as a result of changes in forecasted apportionment in 2013 and as a result of the
merger in 2012. See Note 14 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(h)  
  Reflects the non-cash impact for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (net of taxes of $219 million and $491 million, respectively) of the amortization of intangible
assets, net, related to commodity contracts recorded at fair value at the Constellation merger date. See Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
    
         82   

(i)  
  Reflects the non-cash amortization of certain debt for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (net of taxes of $5 million and $6 million, respectively) recorded at fair
value at the Constellation merger date which was retired in the second quarter of 2013. See Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(j)  
  Reflects a non-cash charge to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013 (net of taxes of $102 million) resulting from the first quarter 2013 remeasurement of a like-kind
exchange tax position taken on ComEd s 1999 sale of fossil generating assets. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements for additional information.     

(k)  
  Reflects 2013 impairment and related charges to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013 (net of taxes of $69 million) primarily related to Generation s
cancellation of nuclear uprate projects and the impairment of certain wind generating assets.     

(l)  
  Reflects costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2012 associated with the Constellation merger (net of taxes of $101 million) as part of the Maryland order approving
the merger transaction. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(m)  
  Reflects costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2012 (net of taxes of $23 million) as part of a settlement with the FERC to resolve a dispute related to
Constellation s pre-merger hedging and risk management transactions. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(n)  
  Reflects costs incurred to establish estimated liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (net of taxes of $10 million and $5 million,
respectively) pursuant to the Midwest Generation bankruptcy, primarily related to lease payments under a coal rail car lease and estimated payments for asbestos-related personal injury claims.     
        As discussed above, Exelon has incurred and will continue to incur
costs associated with the Constellation merger, including meeting the various commitments set forth by regulators and agreed-upon with other interested parties as part of the merger approval process, and integrating the former Constellation
businesses into Exelon.            For the year ended
December 31, 2013, expense has been recognized for costs incurred to achieve the merger, prior to consideration of regulatory accounting treatment, as follows:   

(a)  
  For Exelon, Generation and BGE, includes the operations of the acquired businesses from the date of the merger March 12, 2012 through the year ended December 31, 2013.

(b)  
  Costs primarily for employee severance, pension and OPEB expense and retention bonuses. ComEd established regulatory assets of $2 million and $21 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. BGE established regulatory assets of $0 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The majority of these costs are expected to
be recovered over a five-year period.     

(c)  
  Costs to integrate Constellation processes and systems into Exelon and to terminate certain Constellation debt agreements. ComEd established a regulatory asset of $9 million and
$15 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, for certain other merger and integration costs. BGE established a regulatory asset of $12 million and $0 million for the years ended December 31,
2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, for certain other merger and integration costs.     

(d)  
  External, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers and other experts to assist in the due diligence and regulatory approval processes and in the closing of the
transaction.     
         83   

As of December 31, 2013, Exelon expects to incur total additional Constellation merger-related
expenses in 2014 and 2015 of approximately $34 million.         
  Pursuant to the conditions set forth by the MDPSC in its approval of the merger transaction, Exelon committed to provide a package of benefits to
BGE customers, and make certain investments in the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of Maryland of approximately $1 billion. The direct investment includes $95 million to $120
million for the requirement to cause construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses. On March 20, 2013, Generation signed a twenty-year lease agreement that is contingent upon the
developer obtaining financing for the construction of the building. Once required approvals are received and financing condition is satisfied, construction of the building will commence. The building is expected to be ready for occupancy in two
years following commencement of construction. The direct investment estimate also includes $625 million in expenditures relating to the development of 285-300 MW of new electric generation facilities in Maryland (expected to be completed over the
next ten years).             Exelon s Strategy and Outlook for 2014 and Beyond
            Exelon s value proposition and competitive
advantage come from its scope and scale across the energy value chain and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline.         
  On March 12, 2012, the Exelon and Constellation merger was completed. The merger creates incremental strategic value by matching Exelon s
clean generation fleet with Constellation s leading customer-facing platform, as well as creating economies of scale through expansion across the energy value chain. Exelon supports customer switching to alternative electric generation
suppliers and the addition of Constellation s competitive retail operations provides another outlet for Exelon to grow its business in competitive markets.         
  Generation s electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide generation to load matching and that diversify the
generation fleet by expanding Generation s regional and technological footprint. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts,
and in wholesale power markets. Generation s customer facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs
an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help
mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.            Exelon s utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. Exelon seeks to
leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. Combined, the utilities plan to invest approximately $15 billion
over the next five years in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.
           Exelon s financial priorities are to maintain
investment grade credit metrics at each of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, and to return value to Exelon s shareholders with a sustainable dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and through earnings growth from
attractive investment opportunities.   
         84   

In pursuing its strategies, Exelon has exposure to various market and financial risks, including the
risk of price fluctuations in the power markets. Power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular, the prices of natural gas and coal, which drive the market
prices that Generation can obtain for the output of its power plants, (2) the rate of expansion of subsidized low-carbon generation in the markets in which Generation s output is sold, (3) the effects on energy demand due to factors
such as weather, economic conditions and implementation of energy efficiency and demand response programs, and (4) the impacts of increased competition in the retail channel. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial,
policy, and legal solutions to these market pricing issues.              Power
Markets                Price of Fuels.   The use
of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in
Exelon s revenues. Since the third quarter of 2011, forward natural gas prices for 2014 and 2015 have declined significantly; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).
             Subsidized Generation.   The rate of
expansion of subsidized low-carbon generation such as wind and solar energy in the markets in which Generation s output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power prices, and in turn, Generation s results of operations.   
        Various states have implemented or proposed legislation, regulations or
other policies to subsidize new generation development, which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity prices. For example, the New Jersey legislature enacted into law in January 2011, the Long Term capacity Pilot Program
(LCAPP). LCAPP provides eligible generators with 15-year fixed contracts for the sale of capacity in the PJM capacity market. Under LCAPP, the local utilities in New Jersey are required to pay (or receive) the difference between generators receive
in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the 15 year contract. New Jersey ultimately selected three proposals to participate in LCAPP and build new generation in the state. In addition, on April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order
directing the Maryland electric utilities to enter into a 20-year contract for differences (CfD) with CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), under which CPV will construct an approximately 700 MW combined cycle gas turbine in Waldorf, Maryland, that it projected
will be in commercial operation by June 1, 2015. CPV has subsequently sought to extend that date. The CfD mandates that utilities (including BGE) pay (or receive) the difference between CPV s contract price and the revenues it receives for
capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the PJM capacity market.            Exelon and others filed a complaint in federal district court challenging the constitutionality and other aspects of the New Jersey legislation. Similarly, Exelon and others are also challenging the selection of
the three generation developers in New Jersey state court proceedings and the MDPSC actions in Maryland state court. On October 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court in New Jersey issued a judgment order finding that the New Jersey legislation
violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and the New Jersey SOCA contract is unenforceable. Similarly, on October 24, 2013, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a judgment order finding that the MDPSC s
Order directing BGE and two other Maryland electric distribution companies to enter into a CfD violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, as described in Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition, on October 1, 2013, a Maryland State Circuit Court upheld the MDPSC Orders as being within the MDPSC s statutory authority under Maryland state law. This decision is separate from the judgment in the
federal litigation that the MDPSC Order is unconstitutional and the CfD unenforceable under federal law. The federal judgment, if upheld, would prevent enforcement of the CfD even if the Circuit Court decision stands. The non-prevailing parties have
sought appeals in federal appellate court in both the New Jersey and   
         85   

Maryland federal litigation. Finally, on October 23, 2013, the New Jersey state court dismissed the New Jersey state proceeding without prejudice, subject to the final outcome of the New
Jersey federal litigation.            As required under their
contracts, two of the New Jersey generator developers and one in Maryland offered and cleared in PJM s capacity market auctions held in May 2012 and 2013. In addition, CPV has announced its intention to move forward with construction of its New
Jersey plant, with or without the challenged state subsidy. Nonetheless to the extent that the state-required customer subsidies are included under their respective contracts, Exelon believes that these projects may have artificially suppressed
capacity prices in PJM in these auctions and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of Exelon s market driven position. While the U.S. District Court decisions in Maryland and New Jersey are positive developments,
continuation of these state efforts, if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule (MOPR), could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and/or energy prices. Other states could seek to establish
programs, which could substantially impact Exelon s market driven position and could have a significant effect on Exelon s financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows.   
        PJM s capacity market rules include a MOPR, which is intended to
preclude sellers from artificially suppressing the competitive price signals for generation capacity. However, as described above, Exelon does not believe that the existing MOPR will work effectively with respect to generator developers who have a
state-sponsored subsidy and has concerns with certain other aspects of PJM s rules related to the capacity auction. Accordingly, Exelon is working with other market stakeholders on several proposed changes to the PJM tariff aimed at
ensuring that capacity resources (including those with state-sponsored subsidy contracts, excessive imported capacity resources and certain limited availability demand response resources) cannot inappropriately affect capacity auction prices in PJM.
           See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Maryland Order.            Exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, opposing policies that ask either taxpayers or consumers to subsidize or give preferential treatment to specific generation providers or technologies, or
that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid.              Energy Demand.   The continued tepid economic environment and growing energy efficiency initiatives have limited the demand for electricity across each of the Exelon utility companies. ComEd
is projecting load volumes to decrease by 0.2% in 2014 compared to 2013, while PECO and BGE are projecting an increase of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013.   
          Retail Competition.   Generation s retail
operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. Recently, sustained low forward natural gas and power prices and low market volatility have
caused retail competitors to aggressively pursue market share, and wholesale generators (including Generation) to use their retail operations to hedge generation output. These factors have adversely affected overall gross margins and profitability
in Generation s retail operations.              Strategic Policy Alignment
             Exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy,
dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price
movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.  
         86   

Exelon s board of directors declared the first quarter 2013 dividend of $0.525 per share, and in
response to low forward energy prices and weaker financial expectations, among other factors, approved a revised dividend policy going forward. The first quarter dividend was paid on March 8, 2013 to shareholders of record on February 19,
2013 and was based on Exelon s previous dividend of $2.10 per share on an annualized basis. The second, third and fourth quarter dividends were based on Exelon s new dividend policy of $0.31 per share quarterly dividend ($1.24 per share on
an annualized basis). All future quarterly dividends require approval by Exelon s board of directors.         
  Exelon and Generation evaluate the economic viability of each of their generating units on an ongoing basis. Decisions regarding the future of
economically challenged generating assets will be based primarily on the economics of continued operation of the individual plants. If Exelon and Generation do not see a path to sustainable profitability in any of their plants, Exelon and Generation
will take steps to retire those plants to avoid sustained losses. Retirement of plants could materially affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows through among other things, potential
impairment charges, accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over the plants remaining useful lives, and ongoing reductions to operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures.   
          Hedging Strategy     
        Exelon s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over
three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into non-derivative and
derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. Generation has hedges in
place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2014 and 2015. However, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently
unhedged. As of December 31, 2013, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 92%-95%, 62%-65% and 30%-33% for 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the
amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging
products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts including Generation s sales of energy to ComEd, PECO and BGE relating to their respective retail load obligations. Generation has been and will continue to be
proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk in subsequent years as well.            Generation procures coal, oil and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts,
contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services, coal, oil and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and
availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted
prices. Approximately 60% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2014 through 2018 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium
concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. ComEd, PECO and BGE mitigate such exposure through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.   
         87   

Growth Opportunities     
        Exelon is currently pursuing growth in both the utility and generation
businesses focused primarily on smart meter and smart grid initiatives at the utilities and on renewables development and the nuclear uprate program at Generation. The utilities also anticipate making significant future investments in infrastructure
modernization and improvement initiatives. Management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon s existing businesses in electric and gas distribution, electric transmission, generation, customer supply of electric and
natural gas products and services, and natural gas exploration and production activities, leveraging Exelon s expertise in those areas.         
    Transmission Development Project.   Exelon and AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC (AEP) are working collaboratively to develop an
extra high-voltage transmission project from the western Ohio border through Indiana to the northern portion of Illinois. Referred to as the Reliability Interregional Transmission Extension (RITE) Line project, the project is expected to strengthen
the high-voltage transmission system and improve overall system reliability. RITELine Illinois, LLC (RITELine Illinois) and RITELine Indiana, LLC (RITELine Indiana) have been formed as project companies to develop and own the project. RITELine
Illinois will own the transmission assets located in Illinois and is owned 75% by ComEd and 25% by RITELine Transmission Development Company, LLC (RTD). RITELine Indiana will own the transmission assets located in Indiana and is owned by AEP
(75%) and RTD (25%). Exelon Transmission Company, LLC and AEP each own 50% of RTD. The total cost of the RITE Line project is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, with the Illinois portion of the line expected to cost approximately $1.2
billion. The ultimate cost and scope of the project are dependent on a number of factors, including RTO requirements, interregional transmission planning process requirements, state siting requirements, routing of the line, and equipment and
commodity costs. Exelon and AEP are currently pursuing the project and other segments that are electrically equivalent in nature for inclusion in interregional planning process between PJM and MISO; if approved through that process, the project
would then need to be approved through the respective planning processes of PJM and MISO.            On July 18, 2011, RITELine Illinois and RITELine Indiana filed at FERC for incentive rates and a formula rate for the RITE Line project. On October 14, 2011, FERC issued an order on the incentive and
formula rate filing. The order grants a base rate of return on common equity of 9.9%, plus a 50 basis point adder for the project being in a RTO and a 100 basis point adder for the risks and challenges of the project, resulting in a total rate of
return on common equity of 11.4%. The order grants a hypothetical capital structure of 45% debt and 55% equity until any part of the project enters commercial operations. The order also grants 100% recovery for construction work in progress, 100%
recovery for abandonment, if the line is abandoned through no fault of the RITELine developers, and the ability to treat pre-construction costs as a regulatory asset. All incentives, including the abandonment incentive, are contingent on inclusion
of the project in the PJM RTEP. The RITELine companies filed for rehearing on several rate of return on common equity issues and argued that the right to collect abandoned costs should not be subject to the project being included in the
RTEP. The RITELine companies also made a compliance filing as called for in the October 14, 2011 Order. FERC accepted this filing on March 16, 2012.   
          Smart Meter and Smart Grid Initiatives.     
         ComEd s Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments.  ComEd
plans to invest approximately $1.3 billion on smart meters and smart grid under EIMA, including $1.0 billion through the AMI Deployment Plan. On June 5, 2013, the ICC issued an interim order approving ComEd s accelerated AMI deployment
plan consistent with the provisions of Senate Bill 9. The deployment plan provides for the installation of 4 million electric smart meters, of which more than 60,000 meters were installed by the end of 2013.   
         PECO s Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments.  In 2010, the
PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan, under which PECO will install more than 1.6 million smart   
         88   

meters. PECO plans to spend up to a total of $595 million and $120 million on its smart meter and smart grid infrastructure, respectively, of which $200 million will be funded by SGIG.
            BGE Smart Grid Initiative.  In August 2010, the MDPSC
approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE which includes the planned installation of 2 million electric and gas smart meters at an expected total cost of approximately $480 million, before considering the $200 million SGIG for
smart grid and other related initiatives.            See Note
3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Smart Meter and Smart Grid Initiatives.         
    Generation Renewable Development   .  On September 30, 2011, Exelon announced the completion of its acquisition of all of the
interests in Antelope Valley, a 230-MW solar photovoltaic (PV) project under development in northern Los Angeles County, California, from First Solar, Inc., which is developing, building, operating, and maintaining the project. The first portion of
the project began operations in December 2012, with six additional blocks coming online in 2013. Exelon has been informed by First Solar of issues relating to delays in the certification of certain components relating to the final two blocks of the
project, which will delay commercial operation of these two blocks until the first half of 2014. The delay will not have a material financial effect on Exelon. Exelon expects the project to be in full commercial operation in the first half of 2014.
The acquisition supports the Exelon commitment to renewable energy as part of Exelon 2020. The project has a 25-year PPA with Pacific Gas   Electric Company for the full output of the plant, which has been approved by the CPUC. Upon
completion, the facility will add 230 MWs to Generation s renewable generation fleet. Total capitalized costs for the facility are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Total capitalized costs incurred through December 31, 2013 were
approximately $968 million. In addition, Generation constructed and placed into service 400 MWs of additional wind generation in 2012 at a cost of $710 million and another 50 MW will be added to Generation s wind portfolio in 2014 with the
expansion of its Beebe project in Michigan, the output of which will be fully contracted under a 20-year PPA.         
    Nuclear Uprate Program.   Generation is engaged in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear
fleet. When economically viable, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and application of expertise gained from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Based on ongoing reviews, the nuclear
uprate implementation plan was adjusted during 2013 to cancel certain projects. The Measurement Uncertainty Recapture uprate projects at the Dresden and Quad Cities nuclear stations were cancelled as a result of the cost of additional plant
modifications identified during final design work which, when combined with then current market conditions, made the projects not economically viable. Additionally, the market conditions prompted Generation to cancel the previously deferred extended
power uprate projects at the LaSalle and Limerick nuclear stations. During 2013, Generation recorded a pre-tax charge to operating and maintenance expense and interest expense of approximately $111 million and $8 million, respectively, to accrue
remaining costs and reverse the previously capitalized costs.         
  Under the nuclear uprate program, Generation has placed into service projects representing 316 MWs of new nuclear generation at a cost of $952
million, which has been capitalized to property, plant and equipment on Exelon s and Generation s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2013, Generation has capitalized $203 million to construction work in progress within
property, plant and equipment for nuclear uprate projects expected to be placed in service by the end of 2016, consisting of 200 MWs of new nuclear generation, that are in the installation phase across four nuclear stations; Peach Bottom in
Pennsylvania and Byron, Braidwood and Dresden in Illinois. The remaining spend associated with these projects is expected to be approximately $300 million through the end of 2016. Generation believes that it is probable that these projects will be
completed. If a project is expected not to be completed as planned, previously capitalized costs will be reversed through earnings as a charge to operating and maintenance expense and interest.

Liquidity           
  Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment
grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants expect cash flows to be
sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.            Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5 billion, $5.3 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion,
respectively. Generation also has bilateral credit facilities with aggregate maximum availability of $0.4 billion.         
    Exposure to Worldwide Financial Markets.   Exelon has exposure to worldwide financial markets. The ongoing European debt crisis has
contributed to the instability in global credit markets. Further disruptions in the European markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants  ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of
December 31, 2013, approximately 30%, or $2.5 billion, of the Registrants  aggregate total commitments were with European banks. The credit facilities include $8.4 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $6.6 billion was available
as of December 31, 2013. There were no borrowings under the Registrants  credit facilities as of December 31, 2013. See Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the credit facilities.         
    February 5, 2014 Winter Ice Storm.   On February 5, 2014, a winter storm which brought a mix of snow, ice and freezing rain to
the region interrupted electric service delivery to nearly 715,000 customers in PECO s service territory. Restoration efforts are continuing and will include significant costs associated with employee overtime, support from other utilities
and incremental equipment, contracted tree trimming crews and supplies. PECO estimates that restoration efforts will result in $60 million to $80 million of incremental operating and maintenance expense and $30 million to $40 million of
incremental capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2014.              Tax
Matters              See Note 14 Income Taxes of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.              Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Developments.                
  Exelon supports the promulgation of certain environmental regulations by the U.S. EPA, including air, water and waste controls for electric
generating units. See discussion below for further details. The air and waste regulations will have a disproportionate adverse impact on fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance
expense, and will likely result in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. Due to their low emission generation portfolios, Generation and CENG will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive
advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. Various bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would prohibit or impede the U.S. EPA s rulemaking efforts. The timing of the consideration of
such legislation is unknown.             Air
Quality.  In recent years, the U.S. EPA has been implementing a series of increasingly stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to NAAQS for conventional air pollutants (e.g., NO   x   , SO   2    and particulate matter) as well as stricter technology requirements to control HAPs (e.g., acid gases, mercury and other heavy metals) from electric generation units. The U.S. EPA continues to review and update
its NAAQS with a tightened particulate matter NAAQS issued in December 2012 and a review   
         90   

of the current 2008 ozone NAAQS that is expected to result in a proposed revision of the ozone NAAQS sometime in fall 2014. These updates will potentially result in more stringent emissions
limits on fossil-fuel electric generating stations. There continues to be opposition among fossil-fuel generation owners to the potential stringency and timing of these air regulations.            In July 2011, the U.S. EPA published CSAPR and in June 2012, it issued final technical corrections. CSAPR requires 28
upwind states in the eastern half of the United States to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in downwind states. On
August 21, 2012, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court held that the U.S. EPA had exceeded its authority in certain material aspects with respect to CSAPR and vacated the rule and remanded it to the U.S. EPA for further rulemaking
consistent with its decision. The Court also ordered that CAIR remain in effect pending finalization of CSAPR on remand. Until the U.S. EPA re-issues CSAPR, Exelon cannot determine the impacts of the rule, including any that would impact power
prices. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the U.S. EPA s petition to review the D.C. Circuit Court s CSAPR decision. Oral argument was held on December 10, 2013. A decision is expected sometime during 2014.   
        On December 16, 2011, the U.S. EPA signed a final rule to reduce
emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the NSPS for electric generating units. The final rule, known as MATS, requires coal-fired electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases
and other metals. To achieve these standards, coal units with no pollution control equipment installed (uncontrolled coal units) will have to make capital investments and incur higher operating expenses. It is expected that owners of smaller, older,
uncontrolled coal units will retire the units rather than make these investments. Coal units with existing controls that do not meet the MATS rule may need to upgrade existing controls or add new controls to comply. Owners of oil units not currently
meeting the proposed emission standards may choose to convert the units to light oils or natural gas, install control technologies, or retire the units. Numerous entities have challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon was granted
permission by the Court to intervene in support of the rule. A decision by the Court will not occur until 2014. The outcome of the appeal, and its impact on power plant operators  investment and retirement decisions, is uncertain.   
        The cumulative impact of these air regulations
could be to require power plant operators to expend significant capital to install pollution control technologies, including wet flue gas desulfurization technology for SO   2    and acid gases, and selective catalytic reduction technology for NO   x   . Exelon, along with the other co-owners of Conemaugh Generating Station are moving forward with plans to improve the existing
scrubbers and install Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) controls to meet the mercury removal requirements of MATS by January 1, 2015. In addition, Keystone already has SCR and Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) controls in place.   
        On January 15, 2013, EPA issued a final rule for NSPS and National
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE NESHAP/NSPS). The final rule allows diesel backup generators to operate for up to 100 hours annually under certain emergency circumstances
without meeting emissions limitations, but requires units that operate over 15 hours to burn low sulfur fuel and report key engine information. The final rule eliminates after May 2014 the 50 hour exemption for peak shaving and other
non-emergency demand response that was included in the proposed rule and, therefore, is not expected to result in additional megawatts of demand response to be bid into the PJM capacity auction.   
        In the absence of Federal legislation, the U.S. EPA is also moving
forward with the regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. EPA is addressing the issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions regulation for new and existing electric generating units through the New Source Performance Standards
(NSPS) under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to President   
         91   

Obama s June 25, 2013 memorandum to U.S. EPA, the Agency re-proposed a Section 111(b) regulation for new units in September 2013 that may result in material costs of compliance for
CO2 emissions for new fossil-fuel electric generating units, particularly coal-fired units. Under the President s memorandum, the U.S. EPA is also required to propose a Section 111(d) rule no later than June 1, 2014 to establish CO2
emission regulations for existing stationary sources. Pursuant to the President s Climate Action Plan, the U.S. EPA re-proposed regulations for the GHG emissions from new fossil fueled power plants on September 20, 2013. The U.S. EPA is
also expected to propose by June 2014 GHG emission regulations for existing stationary sources under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, and to issue final regulations by June 2015. While the nature and impact of the final regulations is not
yet known, to the extent that the rule results in emission reductions from fossil fuel fired plants, imposing some form of direct or indirect price of carbon in competitive electricity markets, Exelon s overall low-carbon generation portfolio
results would benefit.            Exelon supports comprehensive
climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade program for GHG emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions.   
         Water Quality.  Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act
requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. On March 28, 2011, the U.S.
EPA issued a proposed rule, and is required under a Settlement Agreement to issue a final rule by November 4, 2013; on October 30, 2013 the U.S. EPA invoked the  force majeure  provision of the Settlement Agreement to extend the final
rule deadline until November 20, 2013 due to the early October 2013 federal government shutdown. The U.S. EPA and the plaintiffs have stated that the deadline will be extended again for a brief period, but have not yet agreed on a date. The
proposed rule does not require closed cycle cooling (e.g., cooling towers) as the best technology available, and also provides some flexibility in the use of cost-benefit considerations and site-specific factors. The proposed rule affords the state
permitting agency wide discretion to determine the best technology available, which, depending on the site characteristics, could include closed cycle cooling, advanced screen technology at the intake, or retention of the current technology.
           It is unknown at this time whether the final regulations
will require closed-cycle cooling. The economic viability of Generation s facilities without closed-cycle cooling water systems will be called into question by any requirement to construct cooling towers. Should the final rule not require the
installation of cooling towers, and retain the flexibility afforded the state permitting agencies in applying a cost-benefit test and to consider site-specific factors, the impact of the rule would be minimized even though the costs of compliance
could be material to Generation.             Hazardous and Solid
Waste.  Under proposed U.S. EPA rules issued on June 21, 2010, coal combustion residuals (CCR) would be regulated for the first time under the RCRA. The U.S. EPA is considering several options, including classification of CCR either as a
hazardous or non-hazardous waste, under RCRA. Under either option, the U.S. EPA s intention is the ultimate elimination of surface impoundments as a waste treatment process. For plants affected by the proposed rules, this would result in
significant capital expenditures and variable operating and maintenance expenditures to convert to dry handling and disposal systems and installation of new waste water treatment facilities. Generation s plants that would be affected by the
proposed rules are Keystone and Conemaugh in Pennsylvania, which have on-site landfills that meet the requirements of Pennsylvania solid waste regulations for non-hazardous waste disposal. However, until the final rule is adopted, the impact on
these facilities is unknown. The U.S. EPA has entered into a Consent Decree which requires that a final rule be issued by December 19, 2014.         
  See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of
environmental regulation.   
         92   

Other Regulatory and Legislative Actions                Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and the Industry s Response.   On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a
9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami that seriously damaged the nuclear units at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co.   
        In July 2011, an NRC Task Force formed in the aftermath of the
Fukushima Daiichi events issued a report of its review of the accident, including recommendations for future regulatory action by the NRC to be taken in the near and longer term. The NRC staff and the Task Force concluded that nuclear reactors in
the United States are operating safely and do not present an imminent risk to public health and safety. The Task Force s report did not recommend any changes to the existing nuclear licensing process in the United States or changes in the
storage of spent nuclear fuel within the plant s spent nuclear fuel pools.            In 2012, the NRC authorized its staff to issue three immediately effective orders (Tier 1 orders) to commercial reactor licensees operating in the United States for compliance no later than December 31, 2016.
In addition, in 2012, the NRC staff recommended to the NRC the installation of engineered containment filtered venting systems for boiling-water reactors (BWR) with Mark I and Mark II containment structures. In summary, through the initial and/or
subsequent orders and the NRC approved implementation guidance, the Tier 1 orders currently: (1) require licensees to provide sufficient onsite portable equipment and resources to maintain or restore cooling capabilities for the core and spent
fuel pool and to maintain containment integrity until offsite equipment is available and have offsite equipment and resources available to sustain cooling functions indefinitely; (2) provide requirements for vents for BWR s with Mark I and
Mark II containments to remain functional during severe accident conditions including the ability to vent the containment following core damage; and (3) require licensees to install instrumentation to provide a reliable indication of water
level in the spent fuel pool. Finally, the NRC has directed the NRC staff to produce a technical evaluation to support rulemaking that considers filtering and performance-based strategies as options for BWR s with Mark I and Mark II
containments. The NRC staff must then develop a final rule by March 2017.            Additionally, in 2012, the NRC had issued a detailed information request to every operating commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. The information requested requires: (1) use of the current NRC
guidance to reevaluate current seismic and flood risk hazards against the design basis and provide a plan of actions to address vulnerabilities, including risks exceeding the design basis; (2) performance of walk downs to ensure the ability to
respond to seismic and external flooding events and provide a corrective action plan to the NRC to address deficiencies; and (3) assessment of the means to provide power for communications equipment during a severe natural event and identify
staffing required to implement the emergency plan for an event affecting all units with an extended loss of alternating current power and impeded access to the site. The nuclear industry proposed, and the NRC approved, an augmented approach to the
seismic hazard analysis to accommodate industry wide availability of qualified technical resources needed to perform the required analysis. The NRC approved this augmented approach.            Generation has assessed the impacts of the Tier 1 orders and information requests and will continue monitoring the
additional recommendations under review by the NRC staff, both from an operational and a financial impact standpoint. A comprehensive review of the NRC Tier 1 orders and information requests, as well as preliminary engineering assumptions and
analysis, indicate that the financial impact of compliance for the period from 2014 through 2018 is expected to be between approximately $350 million and $375 million of capital and $50 million of operating expense, as previously anticipated in
Generation s planning projections. As Generation completes the design and installation planning for its actions, Generation will update these estimates. Further, Generation estimates incremental costs of $15 to $20 million per unit at eleven
Mark I and II units for the installation of filtered vents, if ultimately required by the NRC. Generation s current assessments are specific to the Tier 1 recommendations as   
         93   

the NRC has not taken specific action with respect to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations. Exelon and Generation are unable to conclude at this time to what extent any actions to comply with
the requirements of Tier 2 and Tier 3 will impact their future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Generation will continue to engage in nuclear industry assessments and actions and stakeholder input. See Item 1A. Risk
Factors, for further discussion of the risk factors.         
    Financial Reform Legislation.   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted in July 2010.
While the Dodd-Frank Act is focused primarily on the regulation and oversight of financial institutions, it also provides for a new regulatory regime for over-the-counter swaps (Swaps), including mandatory clearing, exchange trading, margin
requirements, and other transparency requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, also preserves the ability of end users in the energy industry to hedge their risks. In April 2012, the CFTC issued its rule defining swap dealers and major swap
participants. Exelon has determined that it will conduct its commercial business in a manner that does not require registration as a swap dealer or major swap participant. Notwithstanding, there are additional rulemakings that have not yet been
issued, including the capital and margin rules, which will further define the scope of the regulations and provide clarity as to the impact on the Registrants  business, as well as to potential new opportunities. Depending on these final rules,
the Registrants could be subject to significant new obligations.            The proposed regulations addressing collateral and capital requirements and exchange margin cash postings, when final, could require Generation to increase collateral requirements or cash
postings in lieu of letters of credit currently issued to collateralize Swaps. Exelon had previously estimated that it could be required to make up to $1 billion of additional collateral postings under its bilateral credit lines. Given the swap
dealer and the major swap participant definitions will not apply to Generation, the actual amount of collateral postings that will be required may be lower than Exelon s previous expectations due to the following factors: (a) the majority
of Generation s physical wholesale portfolio does not meet the final CFTC Swap definition; (b) there will be minimal incremental costs associated with Generation s positions that are currently cleared and subject to exchange margin;
and (c) Generation will not be a swap dealer or major swap participant and proposed capital requirements applicable to these entities will not apply to Generation.   
        The actual level of collateral required will depend on many factors,
including but not limited to market conditions, the outcome of final margin rules for Swaps, the extent of its trading activity in Swaps, and Generation s credit ratings. Nonetheless, Generation has adequate credit facilities and
flexibility in its hedging program to meet its anticipated collateral requirements estimated based on conservative assumptions.         
  In addition, the new regulations will impose new and ongoing compliance and infrastructure costs on Generation, which may amount to several million
dollars per year.            Exelon and Generation continue to monitor
the rulemaking procedures and cannot predict the ultimate outcome that the financial reform legislation will have on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   
        ComEd, PECO and BGE could also be subject to various Dodd-Frank Act
requirements to the extent they enter into Swap transactions. However, at this time, management of ComEd, PECO and BGE do not expect to be materially affected by this legislation.   
          Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act.   Since 2011,
ComEd s distribution rates are established through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA. EIMA also provides a structure for substantial capital investment by utilities over a ten-year period to modernize Illinois  electric
utility infrastructure. Participating utilities are required to file an annual update to the performance-based   
         94   

formula rate tariff on or before May 1, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. This annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current
year projected capital additions. The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. Throughout each year, ComEd records regulatory assets or
regulatory liabilities and corresponding increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect and ComEd s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to be approved by the ICC for
that year s reconciliation.            Formula Rate Tariff    
        In March 2013, the Illinois legislature passed Senate Bill 9 to
clarify the intent of EIMA on the three issues decided in the Rehearing Order: an allowed return on ComEd s pension asset; the use of year-end rather than average rate base and capital structure in the annual reconciliation; and the use of
ComEd s weighted average cost of capital interest rate rather than a short-term debt rate to apply to the annual reconciliation. On May 22, 2013, Senate Bill 9 became effective after the Illinois legislature overrode the Governor s
veto of that Bill. On June 5, 2013, the ICC approved ComEd s updated distribution formula rate structure to reflect the impacts of Senate Bill 9.         
  In October 2013, the ICC opened an investigation (the Investigation), in response to a complaint filed by the Illinois Attorney General, to change
the formula rate structure by requesting three changes: the elimination of the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate interest on the annual reconciliation balance, the netting of associated accumulated
deferred income taxes against the annual reconciliation balance in calculating interest, and the use of average rather than year-end rate base for determining any ROE collar adjustment. On November 26, 2013, the ICC issued its final order
in the Investigation, rejecting two of the proposed changes but accepting the proposed change to eliminate the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate interest on the annual reconciliation balance. The
accepted change became effective in January 2014, and is estimated to reduce ComEd s 2014 revenue by approximately $8 million. ComEd and intervenors requested rehearing, however all rehearing requests were denied by the ICC. ComEd and
intervenors have filed appeals with the Illinois Appellate Court. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals. See 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
            Annual Reconciliation    
        On May 30, 2013, ComEd updated its revenue requirement allowed in
the December 2012 Order to reflect the impacts of Senate Bill 9, which resulted in a reduction to the current revenue requirement in effect of $14 million. The rates took effect in July 2013.  
         2013 Filing.  On April 29, 2013, ComEd filed its annual
distribution formula rate, which was updated on May 30, 2013 to reflect the impacts of Senate Bill 9. The ICC s final order, issued on December 19, 2013, increased the revenue requirement by $341 million, reflecting an increase
of $160 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2013 and an increase of $181 million for the annual reconciliation for 2012. The rate increase was set using an allowed return on capital of 6.94% (inclusive of an allowed return on common
equity of 8.72%). The rates took effect in January 2014. ComEd requested a rehearing on specific issues, which was denied by the ICC. ComEd and intervenors also filed appeals. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals. See
3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
    FERC Ameren Order.   In July 2012, FERC issued an order to Ameren Corporation (Ameren) finding that Ameren had improperly included
acquisition premiums/ goodwill in its transmission formula rate, particularly in its capital structure and in the application of AFUDC. FERC also directed Ameren to make   
         95   

refunds for the implied increase in rates in prior years. Ameren has filed for rehearing regarding the July 2012 FERC order. ComEd believes that the FERC order authorizing its
transmission formula rate is distinguishable from the circumstances that led to the July 2012 FERC order in the Ameren case. However, if ComEd were required to exclude acquisition premiums/ goodwill from its transmission formula rate, the impact
could be material to ComEd s results of operations and cash flows.              FERC Order No. 1000 Compliance (ComEd, PECO and BGE).   In FERC Order No. 1000, the FERC required public utility transmission providers to enhance their transmission planning procedures and
their cost allocation methods applicable to certain new regional and interregional transmission projects. As part of the changes to the transmission planning procedures, the FERC required removal from all FERC-approved tariffs and agreements a right
of first refusal to build certain new transmission facilities. In compliance with the regional transmission planning requirements of Order No. 1000, PJM as the transmission provider submitted a compliance filing to FERC on October 25,
2012. On the same day, certain of the PJM transmission owners including ComEd, PECO and BGE (collectively, the PJM Transmission Owners) submitted a filing asserting that their contractual rights embodied in the PJM governing documents continue to
justify their right of first refusal to construct new reliability (and related) transmission projects and that the FERC should not be allowed to override such rights absent a showing that it is in the public interest to do so under the FERC s
  Mobile-Sierra   standard of review. This is a heightened standard of review which the PJM Transmission Owners argued could not be satisfied based on the facts applicable to them. On March 22, 2013, FERC issued an order on the
PJM Compliance Filing and the filing of these PJM Transmission Owners (1) rejecting the arguments of such PJM Transmission Owners that the PJM governing documents were entitled to review under the  Mobile-Sierra  standard,
(2) accepting most of the PJM filing, removing the right-of-first refusal from the PJM tariffs; and (3) directing PJM to remove certain exceptions that it included in its compliance filing that FERC found did not comply with Order
No. 1000. FERC s order could enable third parties to seek to build certain regional transmission projects that had previously been reserved for the PJM Transmission Owners, potentially reducing ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s
financial return on new investments in energy transmission facilities. Numerous parties sought rehearing of the FERC s March 22, 2013 order, including the PJM Transmission Owners who sought rehearing of the FERC s rejection of their
Mobile-Sierra and related arguments. The compliance filing was made on July 22, 2013. On January 16, 2014, FERC issued an order stating that PJM s filing while subject to further orders, is effective as of January 1, 2014.
             FERC Transmission Complaint.   On
February 27, 2013, consumer advocates and regulators from the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, and the Delaware Electric Municipal Cooperatives (the parties), filed a complaint at FERC against BGE and the Pepco Holdings,
Inc. companies relating to their respective transmission formula rates. As of December 31, 2013, BGE cannot predict the likelihood or a reasonable estimate of the amount of a change, if any, in the allowed base return on equity, or a reasonable
estimate of the refund period start date. While BGE cannot predict the outcome of this matter, if FERC orders a reduction of BGE s base return on equity to 8.7%, the annual impact would be a reduction in revenues of approximately $10 million.
See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
    The Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program.   In February 2013, the Maryland General Assembly passed
legislation intended to accelerate gas infrastructure replacements in Maryland by establishing a mechanism for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate
proceedings. Under the new law, following a proceeding before the MDPSC and with the MDPSC s approval of the eligible infrastructure replacement projects along with a corresponding surcharge, BGE could begin charging gas customers a monthly
surcharge for infrastructure costs incurred after June 1, 2013. On August 2, 2013, BGE filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. The new surcharge rates are expected to take effect in the first quarter of 2014.
BGE cannot predict the   
         96   

outcome of this proceeding or how much of the requested plan and related surcharge the MDPSC will approve. The MDPSC held evidentiary hearings on BGE s proposed plan and surcharge on
November 12, 2013 through November 14, 2013. On January 29, 2014, the MDPSC issued a decision conditionally approving the first five years of BGE s plan and surcharge. BGE must submit a list detailing specific projects planned
for 2014 to the MDPSC for approval within 30 days of the decision. Upon approval of the project list by the MDPSC, BGE will be able to implement the surcharge rates on gas customers  bills. The new surcharges are expected to take effect in
the second quarter of 2014. In addition, BGE will be subject to an annual independent audit to review plan performance and progress. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.               Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates             The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management discusses these
policies, estimates and assumptions with its accounting and disclosure governance committee on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the Exelon board of directors. Management believes that
the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of the application of these
accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.             Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation s ARO associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was $4.9 billion at December 31, 2013. The authoritative guidance
requires that Generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. To estimate that liability, Generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a
unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios. The nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing or estimated amounts of the
future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions described as follows:   
          Decommissioning Cost Studies.   Generation uses
unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the costs and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within its industry and other estimates.
Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years.         
    Cost Escalation Factors.   Generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost
studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and
materials, energy, LLRW disposal and other costs.         
    Probabilistic Cash Flow Models.   Generation s probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various
scenarios for decommissioning costs, approaches and timing on a unit-by-unit basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base
cost scenario. Probabilities are assigned to alternative decommissioning approaches which assess the likelihood of performing DECON (a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and
portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safely buried in a LLRW landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for   
         97   

unrestricted use), Delayed DECON (similar to the DECON scenario but with a delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities) or SAFSTOR (a
method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use generally within 60
years after cessation of operations) decommissioning. Probabilities assigned to the timing scenarios incorporate the likelihood of continued operation through current license lives or through anticipated license renewals. Generation s
probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal, which Generation assumed would begin in 2025 in 2013 and 2012. The SNF acceptance date was based on management s estimates of the
amount of time required for the DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure. For more information regarding the estimated date that DOE will begin accepting SNF, see Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.              License Renewals.   Generation
assumes a successful 20-year renewal for each of its nuclear generating station licenses, except for Oyster Creek, in determining its nuclear decommissioning ARO. The current NRC license for Oyster Creek expires in 2029. On December 8, 2010,
Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. As a result of this decision the expected economic life of Oyster Creek was reduced by 10 years to correspond to Exelon s
current best estimate as to the timing of ceasing generation operations at the Oyster Creek unit in 2019. Generation has successfully secured 20-year operating license renewal extensions for ten of its nuclear units (including the two Salem units
co-owned by Generation, but operated by PSEG), and none of Generation s applications for an operating license extension have been denied. Generation is in various stages of the process of pursuing similar extensions on its remaining nine
operating nuclear units. Generation s assumption regarding license extension for ARO determination purposes is based in part on the good current physical condition and high performance of these nuclear units; the favorable status of the ongoing
license renewal proceedings with the NRC, and the successful renewals for ten units to date. Generation estimates that the failure to obtain license renewals at any of these nuclear units (assuming all other assumptions remain constant) would
increase its ARO on average approximately $210 million per unit as of December 31, 2013. The size of the increase to the ARO for a particular nuclear unit is dependent upon the current stage in its original license term and its specific
decommissioning cost estimates. If Generation does not receive license renewal on a particular unit, the increase to the ARO may be mitigated by Generation s ability to delay ultimate decommissioning activities under a SAFSTOR method of
decommissioning.              Discount Rates.   The
probability-weighted estimated future cash flows using these various scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. The accounting
guidance required Generation to establish an ARO at fair value at the time of the initial adoption of the current accounting standard. Subsequent to the initial adoption, the ARO is adjusted for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash
flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions, as described above.            Under the current accounting framework, the ARO is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the CARFR that occur in isolation. This differs from the accounting requirements for other long-dated
obligations, such as pension and other post-employment benefits that are required to be re-measured as and when corresponding discount rates change. If Generation s future nominal cash flows associated with the ARO were to be discounted at
current prevailing CARFRs, the obligation would increase from approximately $4.9 billion to approximately $5.5 billion. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the NDTs. The NDTs are recorded on Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013 at fair value of approximately $8.1 billion and have an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return of 5.9 % to 6.7 %.   
        To illustrate the significant impact that changes in the CARFR, when
combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the ARO: i) had   
         98   

Generation used the 2012 CARFRs rather than the 2013 CARFRs in performing its third quarter 2013 ARO update, Generation would have reduced the ARO by approximately $10 million as compared to the
actual decrease to the ARO of $140 million; and ii) if the CARFR used in performing the third quarter 2013 ARO update (which also reflected increases in the amounts and changes to the timing of projected cash flows) was increased or decreased by 100
basis points, the ARO would have decreased by $300 million and increased $40 million, respectively, as compared to the actual decrease of $140 million.         
    ARO Sensitivities.   Changes in the assumptions underlying the foregoing items could materially affect the decommissioning obligation.
The impact to the ARO of a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions will change as well. As an example, Exelon had a historical increase of approximately $670 million in the value of the ARO which was
driven by Generation modifying the assumed timing of the DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal from 2020 to 2025. The modification of the assumed DOE acceptance date affected the calculation of the ARO in isolation as follows; i) the change in the
timing of DOE acceptance of SNF increased the total number of years in which decommissioning activities are estimated to occur, by five years on average, thereby increasing the total expected nominal cash flows required to decommission the units;
ii) the nominal cash flows were subjected to additional escalation as a result of the extension of the decommissioning period increasing the total estimated costs required to decommission the units; and iii) the escalated cash flows were discounted
at the then current CARFRs which had dramatically decreased during that time period.            The following table illustrates the effects of changing certain ARO assumptions, discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

   Goodwill (Exelon and ComEd)          
  As of December 31, 2013, Exelon s and ComEd s carrying amount of goodwill was approximately $2.6 billion, relating to the acquisition
of ComEd in 2000 as part of the PECO/Unicom Merger. Under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for goodwill, ComEd is required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the ComEd reporting unit   
         99   

below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or operating component and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Entities
assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. In performing a qualitative assessment, entities should assess, among other things,
macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, cost factors, and entity-specific events. If an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more
likely than not greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is required. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less
than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value-based test is performed. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If
the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the
identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these
fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s business and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step (if needed),
management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.            Management concluded the remeasurement of the like-kind exchange position and the charge to ComEd s earnings in the first quarter of 2013 triggered an interim goodwill impairment assessment and, as a result,
ComEd tested its goodwill for impairment as of January 31, 2013. The first step of the interim impairment assessment comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill;
therefore, the second step was not required.            ComEd
performed a quantitative assessment as of November 1, 2013, for its 2013 annual goodwill impairment assessment. The first step of the interim impairment assessment comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including
goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill; therefore, the second step was not required.            While neither the interim nor the annual assessments indicated an impairment of ComEd s goodwill, certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value of ComEd are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse
regulatory actions, such as early termination of EIMA, or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows from ComEd s
business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in a future impairment of ComEd s goodwill, which could be material. Based on the results of the annual goodwill test performed as of November 1, 2013, the estimated fair value
of ComEd would have needed to decrease by more than 10% for ComEd to fail the first step of the impairment test. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, Note 10 Intangible Assets and Note 14 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Purchase Accounting (Exelon and Generation)          
  In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, the purchase price of an acquired business is generally allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. Any unallocated purchase price amount is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if it exceeds the estimated fair value and as a bargain purchase gain on the
income statement if it is below the estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and   
         100   

liabilities assumed requires management s judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing
and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as
well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 4 Merger and
Acquisitions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Unamortized Energy Assets and Liabilities (Exelon and Generation)          
  Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that Generation
has acquired. The initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contract at the time of acquisition, and the balance is amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows. Amortization
expense and income are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues. Refer to Note 4 Mergers and Acquisitions and Note 10 Intangible Assets for further discussion.   
         Impairment of Long-lived Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE regularly
monitor and evaluate their long-lived assets and asset groups, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows
and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, including current energy prices and market conditions, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly
before the end of its useful life, among others.            The review
of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. For the generation business,
forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power, costs of fuel and the expected operations of assets. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding
the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the
long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. For the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by evaluation of several factors, including the geographic
dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units and associated intangible contract assets recorded on the balance sheet. The cash flows from the generation units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio
level with cash flows generated from Generation s customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from contracts that are accounted for as intangible contract assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. In certain
cases generation assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generation assets (typically contracted renewables).   
        Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset or asset
group exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant s view of the exit price of the assets. This includes significant assumptions of the
estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected and   
         101   

there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, to the extent that any of the information used
in the fair value analysis requires adjustment, the resulting fair market value would be different. As such, the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) such as
revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources. An impairment determination would require the affected Registrant to
reduce either the long-lived asset or asset group, including any intangible contract assets and liabilities, and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment.   
        Generation evaluates unproved gas producing properties at least
annually to determine if they are impaired. Impairment for unproved gas property occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling, lease expiration is at risk, or historical experience indicates a decline in carrying value below fair value.
           Exelon holds investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia
and Texas subject to long-term leases. The investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. The investments represent the estimated residual values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. On an annual
basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying
values. Exelon estimates the fair value of the residual values of its direct financing lease investments using a discounted cash flow analysis, which takes into consideration the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to operate
the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates.            Generation also evaluates its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired based on whether the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature.
Additionally, if one of Generation s equity method investments recognize an impairment, Generation would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss through its equity earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates. Generation would
also evaluate the investment for a decline in value at that time that is not temporary in nature.            See Note 8 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of asset impairment evaluations made by Exelon.   
         Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO
and BGE)             The Registrants have significant investments
in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. Depreciation of these assets is generally provided over their estimated service lives on a straight-line basis using the composite method. The
estimation of service lives requires management judgment regarding the period of time that the assets will be in use. As circumstances warrant, the estimated service lives are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed. Depreciation rates
incorporate assumptions on interim retirements based on actual historical retirement experience. To the extent interim retirement patterns change, this could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income
statement. Changes to depreciation estimates resulting from a change in the estimated end of service lives could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of the Registrants.         
  The estimated service lives of the nuclear generating facilities are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year
license renewal extension of the operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. While Generation has   
         102   

received license renewals for certain facilities, and has applied for or expects to apply for and obtain approval of license renewals for the remaining facilities, circumstances may arise that
would prevent Generation from obtaining additional license renewals. Generation also evaluates annually the estimated service lives of its generating facilities based on feasibility assessments as well as economic and capital requirements. The
estimated service lives of hydroelectric facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of the Conowingo and Muddy Run operating licenses. A change in depreciation estimates resulting
from Generation s extension or reduction of the estimated service lives could have a significant effect on Generation s results of operations. Generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2010, which resulted
in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2010. Constellation completed a depreciation rate study during the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective during the
fourth quarter of 2010.            ComEd is required to file a
depreciation rate study at least every five years with the ICC. ComEd completed a depreciation study in 2014 and filed the updated depreciation rates with both FERC and the ICC in January 2014. This is expected to result in the implementation
of new depreciation rates effective first quarter 2014.           PECO
is required to file a depreciation rate study at least every five years with the PAPUC. In April 2010, PECO filed a depreciation rate study with the PAPUC for both its electric and gas assets, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation
rates effective January 1, 2010 for electric transmission assets and January 1, 2011 for electric distribution and gas assets.         
  The MDPSC does not mandate the frequency or timing of BGE s depreciation studies. In December 2006, BGE filed revised depreciation rates with
the MDPSC for both its electric distribution and gas assets. Revisions to depreciation rates from this filing were finalized July 1, 2010.         
   Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for substantially all Generation,
ComEd, PECO, BGE and BSC employees. See Note 16 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement
benefit plans.            The measurement of the plan obligations and
costs of providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required
assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan
participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and
upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in
the income statement. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. Pension and other
postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are ultimately allocated to projects within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.   
         103   

Pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and
international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds. See Note 16 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and classification under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with authoritative guidance.   
          Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets.   The long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets assumption used in calculating pension costs was 7.50%, 7.50%, and 8.00% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The weighted average expected return on assets assumption used in calculating other postretirement
benefit costs was 6.45%, 6.68%, and 7.08% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The pension trust activity is non-taxable, while other postretirement benefit trust activity is partially taxable. The current year EROA is based on asset allocations
from the prior year end. In 2010, Exelon began implementation of a liability-driven investment strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. As a result of this modification, over time, Exelon
determined that it will decrease equity investments and increase investments in fixed income securities and alternative investments in order to achieve a balanced portfolio of liability hedging and return-generating assets. See Note
16 Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon s asset allocations. Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.59% to estimate its 2014 pension and other postretirement
benefit costs, respectively.            Exelon calculates the expected
return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In
determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years.
For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to
be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For other postretirement benefit plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.            Actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. The actual asset returns across the Registrants  pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 6.73% and 11.41%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of
7.50% and 6.45%, respectively.              Discount Rate.  
The discount rates used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were 4.80% and 4.90%, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The discount rates at December 31, 2013 represent weighted-average rates for both
pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make
whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated distributions under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The
discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.            The discount rate assumptions used to determine the obligation at year end are used to determine the cost for the
following year. Exelon will use discount rates of 4.80% and 4.90% to estimate its 2014 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.         
    Health Care Reform Legislation.   In March 2010, the Health Care Reform Acts were signed into law, which contain a number of provisions
that impact retiree health care plans provided by employers.   
         104   

One such provision reduces the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree health care costs to the extent an employer s postretirement health care plan receives Federal
subsidies that provide retiree prescription drug benefits at least equivalent to those offered by Medicare. Although this change did not take effect immediately, the Registrants were required to recognize the full accounting impact in their
financial statements in the period in which the legislation was enacted. Additionally, as a result of this deductibility change for employers and other Health Care Reform provisions that impact the federal prescription drug subsidy options provided
to employers, Exelon changed the manner in which it will receive prescription drug subsidies beginning in 2013.         
  The Health Care Reform Acts include a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans beginning in 2018, whereby premiums paid over
a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate. Although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2018, accounting guidance requires Exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise tax in its annual actuarial valuation. The
application of the legislation is still unclear and Exelon continues to monitor the Department of Labor and IRS for additional guidance. Effective in 2002, Constellation amended its other postretirement benefit plans for all subsidiaries other than
Nine Mile Point by capping retiree medical coverage for future retirees who were under the age of 55 on January 1, 2002 at 2002 levels. Therefore, the excise tax is not expected to have a material impact on the legacy Constellation other
postretirement benefit plans. However, certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on the other postretirement obligation for legacy Exelon plans, including projected inflation rates (based on the CPI) and whether
pre- and post-65 retiree populations can be aggregated in determining the premium values of health care benefits. Exelon reflected its best estimate of the expected impact in its annual actuarial valuation.   
          Health Care Cost Trend Rate.   Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the costs reported for Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans. Accounting guidance requires that annual health care cost estimates be developed using past and present health care cost trends (both
for Exelon and across the broader economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns, technological advances and changes in the health status of plan participants. Therefore,
the trend rate assumption is subject to significant uncertainty, particularly when considering potential impacts of the 2010 Health Care Reform Acts. Exelon assumed an initial health care cost trend rate of 6.50% for 2013, decreasing to an ultimate
health care cost trend rate of 5.00% in 2017.         
    Sensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions.   The following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial
assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):         
 
         105   

(a)  
  In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the
discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for a portion of its pension asset portfolio in
2010. The sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.           
    Average Remaining Service Period.   For pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial
gains and losses, as applicable, based on participants  average remaining service periods. The average remaining service period of defined benefit pension plan participants was 11.8 years, 11.9 years, and 12.1 years for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.            For
other postretirement benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs over participants  average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes its transition obligations and certain actuarial gains and losses
over participants  average remaining service period to expected retirement. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to benefit eligibility age was 8.7 years, 8.9 years and 6.6 years for the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to expected retirement was 9.8 years, 10.1 years and 8.7 years for the years ended December 31,
2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.             Regulatory Accounting (Exelon, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE account for
their regulated electric and gas operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulations, which requires Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their
financial statements. This guidance is applicable to entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the
entities  cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities costs from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because
of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to
customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. As of December 31, 2013, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE have concluded that the operations of ComEd, PECO and BGE meet the
criteria to apply the authoritative guidance. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of those operations no longer meets the criteria of this guidance, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE would be required to eliminate any associated
regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and could be material. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE.         
  For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities
continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. Furthermore, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE make other judgments related to the financial statement impact of their
regulatory environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies, if any, to which costs will be recoverable through rates. Refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional
information on the annual revenue   
         106   

reconciliations associated with ComEd s distribution formula rate tariff, pursuant to EIMA, and FERC-approved transmission formula rate tariffs for ComEd and BGE. Additionally, estimates are
made in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies as to the amount of revenues billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes.
These assessments are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory bodies in ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the
applicable regulatory body. If the assessments and estimates made by Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be
material.            The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate
order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties
affected by the order.             Accounting for Derivative Instruments (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The Registrants
utilize derivative instruments to manage their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, changes in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances and changes in the fair value of outstanding debt. Generation uses a variety of derivative
and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. Additionally, Generation enters into
energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. ComEd has entered into contracts to procure energy, capacity and ancillary services. In addition, ComEd had a financial swap contract with Generation that expired May 31, 2013 and
currently holds floating-to-fixed energy swaps with several unaffiliated suppliers that extend into 2032. PECO and BGE have entered into derivative natural gas contracts to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO has also
entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive RFP process as outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. BGE has also entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive auction
process as outlined in its MDPSC-approved SOS Program. ComEd, PECO and BGE do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. The Registrants  derivative activities are in accordance with Exelon s Risk Management Policy (RMP).
See Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  derivative instruments.         
  The Registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. Determining whether or not a contract
qualifies as a derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing the market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts.
Further, interpretive guidance related to the authoritative literature continues to evolve, including how it applies to energy and energy-related products. Changes in management s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and
changes in authoritative guidance related to derivatives, could result in previously excluded contracts being subject to the provisions of the authoritative derivative guidance. Generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium, contracts
to purchase and sell capacity in certain ISO s, certain emission products and RECs do not meet the definition of a derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium, certain
capacity, emission nor the REC markets are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. If these markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and Generation would be required to account for
these contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with Generation s other derivative instruments. In this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts,
Generation would be required to record mark-to-market gains or losses, which may have a significant impact to Exelon s and Generation s financial positions and results of operations.   
         107   

Under current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their
fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair value or cash flow
hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting
the change in the hedged cash flows of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in
earnings immediately. For commodity transactions, effective with the date of merger with Constellation, Generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges
prior to the merger. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remain probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated OCI and will be reclassified to results of operations when the
forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. None of Constellation s designated cash flow hedges for commodity transactions prior to the merger were re-designated as cash flow hedges. The
effect of this decision is that all economic hedges for commodities are recorded at fair value through earnings for the combined company. In addition, for energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair
value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. For economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for ComEd, PECO and BGE, changes in the fair value each period are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.
             Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception.  
As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and
energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. While some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these
qualifying transactions have been designated as normal purchases and normal sales and are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases
and normal sales exception requires that management exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. Revenues
and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. Contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which
physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and is not financially settled on a net basis. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with suppliers as
part of ComEd s energy procurement process, PECO s full requirement contracts and block contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP program, most of PECO s natural gas supply agreements and all of BGE s full requirement contracts and
natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception.         
    Commodity Contracts.   Identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires Generation to determine that the contract is
in accordance with the RMP. Generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the RMP.         
  As a part of accounting for derivatives, the Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements,
interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial
accounting treatment for derivative transactions. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
  
         108   

the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued
using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges
are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and
corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The
Registrant s derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. The remaining derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as
contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps
and options, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and
unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity,
volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. The Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized
in Level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. The impacts of credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been material to the financial
statements.              Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange
Derivative Instruments.   The Registrants may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve the targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt.
Additionally, the Registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings and floating to fixed swaps for project financing. In addition, Generation enters
into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. The characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the economic hedge and proprietary trading
activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate exposure. Generation does not utilize interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or change
in market interest rates. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic
hedges. The fair value of the agreements is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curves. As these inputs are
based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are primarily categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain exchange based interest rate derivatives that are valued
using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.         
  See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and Notes 11 and 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  derivative instruments.             Taxation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Significant management judgment is required in determining the Registrants  provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and
  
         109   

liabilities and valuation allowances. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a
two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not
more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met
the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant
information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements.
           The Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of
realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax
attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the Registrants conclude it is
more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.            Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Registrants  forecasted financial condition and results of
operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While the Registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2013
and 2012 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such
adjustments could be material. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding taxes.         
   Accounting for Loss Contingencies (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        In the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make
judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amounts recorded may differ from the actual expense
incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. The estimates that the Registrants make in accounting for loss contingencies and the actual results that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on
their consolidated financial statements.         
    Environmental Costs.   Environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of
sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work, changes in technology, regulations and the
requirements of local governmental authorities. Periodic studies are conducted at ComEd, PECO and BGE to determine future remediation requirements and estimates are adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at Generation to
assess the adequacy of its environmental reserves. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant effect on the Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 22 of
the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.              Other, Including Personal Injury Claims.   The Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers  compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses
are   
         110   

within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The
IBNR reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties
surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material
effect on the Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows.             Revenue Recognition (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
    Sources of Revenue and Selection of Accounting Treatment.   The Registrants earn revenues from various business activities including:
the sale of energy and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail) ;  the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision
of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.         
  The appropriate accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable accounting
standards. The Registrants primarily use accrual and mark-to-market accounting as discussed in more detail below.         
    Accrual Accounting.   Under accrual accounting, the Registrants record revenues in the period when services are rendered or energy is
delivered to customers. The Registrants generally use accrual accounting to recognize revenues for sales of electricity, natural gas, and other commodities as part of their physical delivery activities. The Registrants enter into these sales
transactions using a variety of instruments, including non-derivative agreements, derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) of commodities that will be physically delivered, sales to utility
customers under regulated service tariffs, and spot-market sales, including settlements with independent system operators.         
    Mark-to-Market Accounting.   The Registrants record revenues using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that meet
the definition of a derivative for which they are not permitted, or have not elected, the NPNS exception. These mark-to-market transactions primarily relate to risk management activities and economic hedges of other accrual activities.
Mark-to-market revenues include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable and realized; and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts.   
          Use of Estimates.   Estimates are based upon actual costs
incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliations can be affected by, among other things,
variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.              Unbilled Revenues   .  The determination of Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s retail energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer
meters generally on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is
affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in volumes
delivered to the utilities  customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, volumes may fluctuate
monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, which could be   
         111   

significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number
and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.   
        See Note 6 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.              Regulated
Transmission   Distribution Revenues   .  ComEd s EIMA distribution formula rate tariff provides for annual reconciliations to the distribution revenue requirement. As of the balance sheet dates, ComEd has recorded its best
estimates of the distribution revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC in accordance with the formula rate mechanism. Estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in
rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and
investments made and actions by regulators or courts.         
  ComEd s and BGE s FERC transmission formula rate tariffs provide for annual reconciliations to the transmission revenue requirements. As
of the balance sheet dates, ComEd and BGE have recorded the best estimate of their respective transmission revenue impact resulting from changes in rates that ComEd and BGE believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with the formula rate
mechanism. Estimates are based upon actual costs incurred and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated
reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred and investments made and actions by regulators or courts.         
   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the
Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd and PECO estimate the
allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit
quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of
accounts receivable in each risk segment. BGE estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by assigning reserve factors for each aging bucket. These percentages were derived from a study of billing progression which
determined the reserve factors by aging bucket. ComEd, PECO and BGE customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis.
ComEd, PECO and BGE customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and
economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC regulations, respectively. See Note 6 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.

Results of Operations by Business Segment    
        The comparisons of operating results and other statistical information
for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 set forth below include intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in Exelon s consolidated financial statements.              Net Income (Loss) on Common Stock by Business Segment     

Results
of Operations Generation          

(a)  
    Generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides      
         113   

information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other
companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.      
 
          Net Income Attributable to Membership Interest     
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012.  Generation s net income attributable to membership interest increased compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to higher revenues, net of purchased power and fuel expense, lower operating and maintenance
expense and higher earnings from Generation s interest in CENG; partially offset by impairment of certain generating assets, higher depreciation expense, higher property taxes, and higher interest expense. The increase in revenues, net or
purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to increased capacity prices and higher nuclear volume partially offset by lower realized energy prices, higher nuclear fuel costs, and lower mark-to-market gains in 2013. The decrease in operating
and maintenance expense was largely due to 2012 costs associated with a settlement with FERC in 2012 and decreases in transaction costs and employee-related costs associated with the merger.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  Generation s net income
attributable to membership interest decreased compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to higher operating expenses, the loss on the sale of Brandon Shores, Wagner and C.P. Crane (collectively Maryland generating stations) and the
amortization of acquired energy contracts recorded at fair value at the merger date; offset by higher revenues, net of purchased power and fuel expense and favorable NDT fund performance. The increase in operating expenses was due to the addition of
Constellation s financial results from March 12, 2012, costs related to a 2012 settlement with FERC and transaction and employee-related severance costs associated with the merger. The increase in revenues, net of purchased power and fuel
expense was also primarily due to the merger. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the loss on the sale of three Maryland generating stations.

         116   

The following table presents electric revenue
net of purchased power and fuel expense per MWh of electricity sold during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 and 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.   

(a)  
  Includes financial results for the Constellation business transferred to Generation beginning on March 12, 2012, the date the merger was completed.     

(d)  
  Other Regions includes South, West and Canada, which are not considered individually significant.     

(e)  
  Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense per MWh represents the average margin per MWh of electricity sold during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, and excludes the mark-to-market impact of Generation s economic hedging activities.     

(f)  
  Excludes Generation s other business activities not allocated to a region, including retail and wholesale gas, upstream natural gas, proprietary trading, energy efficiency,
energy management and demand response. Also excludes Generation s compensation under the reliability-must-run rate schedule, the financial results of Brandon Shores, H.A. Wagner, and C.P. Crane, the generating facilities divested in the fourth
quarter of 2012 as a result of the Exelon and Constellation merger, and amortization of certain intangible assets relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value as a result of the Exelon and Constellation merger of $488 million and $1,098
million, respectively.               Mid-Atlantic    
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012 . The decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic of $163 million was primarily due to lower realized power prices and increased nuclear fuel costs, partially offset by the addition of
Constellation in 2012, higher capacity revenues, and higher nuclear revenues.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic of $83 million was primarily due to the
addition of Constellation in 2012 and higher capacity revenues, partially offset by lower realized power prices and increased nuclear fuel costs.   
         117   

Midwest          
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel
expense in the Midwest of $412 million was primarily due to lower realized power prices, increased nuclear fuel costs, and lower capacity revenues, partially offset by higher nuclear revenues.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . The decrease in revenue net of
purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest of $549 million was primarily due to lower capacity revenues, increased nuclear fuel costs, and lower realized power prices, partially offset by decreased congestion costs.   
         New England              Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 . The $11 million decrease in
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in New England is primarily due to lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the addition of Constellation in 2012. Prior to the merger, New England was not a significant contributor to revenue
net of purchased power and fuel expense at Generation.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . The $187 million increase in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in New England was the result of the Constellation merger. Prior to the merger, New England was not a significant contributor to revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense at Generation.   
         New York    
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012.  The $80 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in New York was primarily due to decreased realized energy prices, partially offset by the addition of Constellation. Prior to the merger, New
York was not a significant contributor to revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense at Generation.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . The $76 million increase in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in New York was the result of the Constellation merger. Prior to the merger, New York was not a significant contributor to revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense at Generation.   
         ERCOT    
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012.  The $31 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in ERCOT was primarily due to increased realized energy prices and the addition of Constellation in 2012, partially offset by a decrease due to
the termination of an energy supply contract with a retail power supply company that was previously a consolidated variable interest entity. As a result of the termination, Generation no longer has a variable interest in the retail supply company
and ceased consolidation of the entity during the third quarter of 2013.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The $321 million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in ERCOT was primarily as a result of the
addition of Constellation in 2012, partially offset by a decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the legacy Generation ERCOT portfolio driven by the performance of Generation s generating units during extreme weather
events that occurred in Texas in February and August 2011.   
         118   

Other Regions          
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The $70 million increase in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in Other Regions was primarily as a result of the addition of Constellation in 2012, in addition to increased renewable generation.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The $145 million increase in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in Other Regions was primarily as a result of the Constellation merger.             Mark-to-market          
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 . Generation is exposed to market risks associated with
changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations. Mark-to-market gains on economic hedging activities were $504 million in 2013 compared to gains of $515 million in 2012. See Notes 11 and 12 of
the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on gains and losses associated with mark-to-market derivatives.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . Generation is exposed to market risks associated with
changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations. Mark-to-market gains on economic hedging activities were $515 million in 2012 compared to losses of $288 million in 2011. See Note 11 and 12 of
the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on gains and losses associated with mark-to-market derivatives.         
   Other              Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The $627 million increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel was primarily due to reduced amortization expense
of the acquired energy contracts recorded at fair value at the merger date. In addition, the increase is also attributable to results from activities acquired as part of the 2012 merger with Constellation including retail gas, energy efficiency,
energy management and demand response, upstream natural gas, and the design and construction of renewable energy facilities. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense from the sale of
Brandon Shores, H.A. Wagner and C.P. Crane, the generating facilities divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Exelon and Constellation merger. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding contract intangibles and assets planned for divestiture as a result of the Constellation merger.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The $510 million decrease in other revenue net of purchased
power and fuel was primarily due to increased amortization expense of the acquired energy contracts recorded at fair value at the merger date. This decrease was partially offset by results from activities acquired as part of the 2012 merger with
Constellation including retail gas, energy efficiency, energy management and demand response, upstream natural gas and the design and construction of renewable energy facilities. In addition, other revenue net of purchased power and fuel includes
the results of Brandon Shores, H.A. Wagner and C.P. Crane, the generating facilities divested in fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Exelon and Constellation merger. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding contract intangibles and assets planned for divestiture as a result of the Constellation merger.         
    Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor and Production Costs           
  The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for 2013, as compared to 2012 and 2011, for the Generation-operated plants. The nuclear
fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined   
         119   

as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period. Nuclear fleet production cost
is defined as the costs to produce one MWh of energy, including fuel, materials, labor, contracting and other miscellaneous costs, but excludes depreciation and certain other non-production related overhead costs. Generation considers capacity
factor and production costs useful measures to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. Generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures
are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.         

(a)  
  Excludes Salem, which is operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC, and CENG s nuclear facilities, which are operated by CENG. Reflects ownership percentage of stations operated by
Exelon.               Year Ended December 31, 2013
Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem, increased primarily due to a lower number of planned refueling outage days in 2013, partially offset by a higher number of non-refueling
outage days. For 2013 and 2012, planned refueling outage days totaled 233 and 274, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 75 and 73, respectively. Higher nuclear fuel costs and higher plant operating and maintenance costs, partially
offset by higher number of net MWhs generated resulted in a higher production cost per MWh during 2013 as compared to 2012.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem,
decreased primarily due to a higher number of non-refueling outage days, partially offset by a lower number of planned refueling outage days in 2012. For 2012 and 2011, planned refueling outage days totaled 274 and 283, respectively, and
non-refueling outage days totaled 73 and 52, respectively. Higher nuclear fuel costs resulted in a higher production cost per MWh during 2012 as compared to 2011.   
          Operating and Maintenance Expense     
        The changes in operating and maintenance expense for 2013 compared to
2012, consisted of the following:

Results of Operations ComEd    

(a)  
  ComEd evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenues net of purchased power expense. ComEd believes that revenues net of purchased power expense is a useful
measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. In general, ComEd only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. ComEd has included its discussion of revenues net of
purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, revenues net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies 
presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.                Net Income           
   Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  ComEd s net income for the year ended
December 31, 2013, was lower than the same period in 2012, primarily due to the remeasurement of Exelon s like-kind exchange tax position, partially offset by increased electric distribution revenues, including the impacts of Senate Bill
9, and increased transmission revenues. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 14 Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  ComEd s net income for the
year ended December 31, 2012, was lower than the same period in 2011, primarily due to increased operating and maintenance expenses, partially offset by increased electric distribution revenues and increased transmission revenues.   
          Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power Expense     
        There are certain drivers of operating revenues that are fully offset
by their impact on purchased power expense, such as commodity procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. ComEd is permitted to recover electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations
in electricity procurement costs have no impact on revenues net of purchased power expense. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s electricity
procurement process.   
         123   

All ComEd customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation
supplier. Customer choice programs do not impact ComEd s volume of deliveries, but do affect ComEd s operating revenues related to supplied energy, which is fully offset in purchased power expense. Therefore, customer choice programs have
no impact on revenues net of purchased power expense.            The
number of retail customers participating in customer choice programs was 2,630,185, 1,627,150 and 380,262 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing 68%, 43% and 10% of total retail customers, respectively. Retail energy
purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 81%, 65% and 56% of ComEd s retail kWh sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During 2012, the City of Chicago and approximately 240
Illinois municipalities, including governmental entities such as townships and counties, approved referenda regarding electric supply aggregation. The referenda allowed governmental officials to identify and sign contracts with competitive electric
generation suppliers on behalf of the eligible retail customers in the community, while also allowing customers to opt-out of the municipal aggregation program. As of December 31, 2013, there are approximately 330 municipalities that have
approved a municipal aggregation referendum in the ComEd service territory. As a result, approximately 69% of residential usage as of December 31, 2013 is being supplied by competitive electric generation suppliers, and ComEd estimates that
over 80% of that usage resulted from municipal aggregation activities.            The changes in ComEd s revenues net of purchased power expense for the year ended 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 consisted of the following:

Weather.  The demand for
electricity is affected by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage.
Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase in revenues net of purchased power expense was offset by unfavorable weather conditions as a result of the mild weather in 2013, compared to the same
period in 2012.            Heating and cooling degree days are
quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in ComEd s service territory with
cooling degree days generally having a more significant impact to ComEd, particularly during the summer months. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
consisted of the following:         
 
         124   

Volume.  Revenues net of purchased power expense decreased as a result of lower delivery volume,
exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2013, reflecting decreased average usage per residential customer as compared to the same period in 2012.   
         Electric Distribution Revenues.  EIMA provides for a
performance-based formula rate tariff, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Distribution revenues vary from
year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing determinants. During the year ended December 31, 2013, ComEd recorded increased revenues of $168 million, primarily due to increased
capital investments, increased operating expenses, and higher allowed return on common equity, including the impacts of Senate Bill 9. These amounts exclude the discrete impacts of the 2012 Distribution Rate Case Orders, discussed separately below.
See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Discrete Impacts of the 2012 Distribution Rate Case Orders.  On October 3, 2012, the ICC issued its final order related to ComEd s
2011 formula rate proceeding under EIMA (Rehearing Order), which reestablished ComEd s position on the return on its pension asset, resulting in an increase to revenues in 2013. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Transmission Revenues.  ComEd s transmission rates are established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd s most recent annual
formula rate update, filed in April 2013, reflects 2012 actual costs plus forecasted 2013 capital additions. Transmission revenues vary from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered and other billing
determinants, such as the highest daily peak load from the previous calendar year. During the year ended December 31, 2013, ComEd recorded increased revenues of $14 million primarily due to increased capital investments and higher operating
expenses. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Regulatory Required Programs.  Revenues related to regulatory required programs are recoveries from customers for costs of various legislative
and regulatory programs on a full and current basis through approved regulated rates. Programs include ComEd s energy efficiency and demand response and purchased power administrative costs. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in
operating and maintenance expense during the periods presented. See the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.   
         Uncollectible Accounts Recovery, Net.  Represents recoveries
under ComEd s uncollectible accounts tariff. See the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on this tariff.         
   Other.  Other revenues, which can vary period to period, include rental revenues, revenues related to late payment charges, assistance
provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs and recoveries of environmental costs associated with MGP sites. Other revenues were higher during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily
due to recoveries of increased environmental costs associated with MGP sites, for which an equal and offsetting amount expense is reflected in depreciation and amortization expense during the periods presented.

           Volume.  Revenues net of
purchased power expense decreased as a result of lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflecting decreased average usage per residential customer as compared to the same period in
2011.             Electric Distribution Revenues.  Under EIMA,
ComEd recorded increased revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 of $53 million, primarily due to increased capital investments and increased operating expenses, partially offset by lower allowed return on common equity. These amounts
exclude the discrete impacts of the 2012 Distribution Rate Case Orders discussed separately below. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Discrete Impacts of the 2012 Distribution Rate Case Orders.  The
May and October 2012 ICC Distribution Rate Case Orders resulted in a reduction to revenues of $13 million in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.             Transmission Revenues.  Based
on the FERC-approved formula, ComEd recorded increased revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 of $40 million, primarily due to increased operating expenses. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.   
         126   

Operating and Maintenance Expense     

(a)  
  Operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required programs are recoveries from customers for costs of various legislative and regulatory programs on a full and current
basis through approved regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues.           
  The changes in operating and maintenance expense for year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 and changes for the year
ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  The increase includes contracting costs resulting from new projects associated with EIMA for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters
of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding EIMA.     

(b)  
  ComEd recorded one-time net benefits in May 2012 as a result of the 2010 Rate Case order to reestablish previously expensed plant balances and to recover previously incurred
costs related to Exelon s 2009 restructuring plan.     

(c)  
  Under EIMA, ComEd makes recurring payments for contribution to a Science and Technology Innovation Trust fund that will be used to fund energy innovation.

(d)  
  ComEd is allowed to recover from or refund to customers the difference between the utility s annual uncollectible accounts expense and the amounts collected in rates
annually through a rider mechanism. In 2013, ComEd recorded a net reduction in operating and maintenance expense related to uncollectible accounts due to the timing of regulatory cost recovery and customers purchasing electricity from competitive
electric generation suppliers as a result of municipal aggregation. An equal and offsetting reduction has been recognized in operating revenues for the periods presented.     
         127   

Depreciation and Amortization Expense              The changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011, consisted of
the following:         

(a)  
  Under EIMA, ComEd is required to recover costs associated with significant storms over a five-year period through the amortization of a regulatory asset.

(b)  
  An equal and offsetting amount for the amortization expense related to MGP remediation expenditures is reflected in operating revenues during the periods presented.
               Taxes Other Than Income     
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012.  Taxes other than income, which can vary period to period, include municipal and state utility taxes, real estate taxes, and payroll taxes. Taxes other than income increased primarily due to increased Illinois electricity
distribution taxes.             Year Ended December 31, 2012
Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to decreased Illinois electricity distribution taxes.

supplier, as all customers are assessed delivery charges. For customers purchasing electricity from ComEd, revenue also reflects the cost of energy and transmission.     

(b)  
  Other revenue primarily includes transmission revenue from PJM. Other items include wholesale revenue, rental revenue, revenues related to late payment charges, assistance
provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs, recoveries of environmental remediation costs associated with MGP sites, and intercompany revenues.     
         129   

Results of Operations PECO    

(a)  
  PECO evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenues net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenue net of fuel expense for gas sales. PECO
believes revenues net of purchased power expense and revenues net of fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenues from operations. PECO has included the
analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, revenues net of purchased power expense and revenue net of fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be
comparable to other companies  presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.           
    Net Income           
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The increase in net income was driven primarily by lower
operating and maintenance expense partially offset by an increase in income taxes.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The decrease in net income was driven primarily by lower operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense and
increased storm costs. The decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily related to unfavorable weather and a decline in electric load. The decrease to net income was partially offset by lower taxes other than income,
interest expense and income taxes.              Operating Revenues Net of
Purchased Power and Fuel Expense                
  Electric and gas revenues and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. PECO s electric
supply and natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to adjustments at least quarterly that are designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of electric supply and natural gas and the amount included in rates
  
         130   

in accordance with the PAPUC s GSA and PGC, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in electric supply and natural gas procurement costs have no impact on electric and gas revenues net of
purchased power and fuel expense.            Electric and gas revenues
and purchased power and fuel expense are also affected by fluctuations in participation in the customer choice program. All PECO customers have the choice to purchase electricity and gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas
suppliers, respectively. The customer s choice of suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenues collected from customers related to supplied energy and natural gas service. Customer choice program activity has no
impact on electric and gas revenues net of purchase power and fuel expense. The number of retail customers purchasing energy from a competitive electric generation supplier was 531,500, 496,500, and 387,600 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 68%, 66%, and 57% of PECO s retail kWh sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The number of retail
customers purchasing natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier was 66,400, 53,600, and 24,800 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas suppliers represented 19%, 16%,
and 11% of PECO s mmcf sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.         
  The changes in PECO s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same
period in 2012 consisted of the following:         
           Weather    
        The demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather conditions.
With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather
conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. Operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense were higher due to the impact of favorable 2013 winter weather conditions.
           Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices
that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO s service territory. The changes in heating and
cooling degree days in PECO s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and normal weather consisted of the following:   

131   

Volume          
  The decrease in electric revenues net of purchased power expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflects the
impact of energy efficiency initiatives on customer usages as well as a shift in the volume profile across classes from higher priced classes to lower priced classes, partially offset by the oil refineries returning to full production in 2013 as
well as moderate economic growth. The decrease in gas revenues net of fuel expense related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, primarily reflects a decline in Residential use per customer.   
         Pricing    
        The decrease in electric operating revenues net of purchased power
expense as a result of pricing is primarily attributable to lower overall effective rates due to increased usage across all major customer classes.         
   Regulatory Required Programs          
  This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the smart meter, energy efficiency
and consumer education programs as well as the administrative costs for the GSA and AEPS programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The offsetting costs of these programs are included in
operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.   
         Gross Receipts Tax             GRT is an excise tax on total electric revenues. As a result of decreases in operating revenues compared to 2012, GRT
decreased. Equal and offsetting decreases in GRT have been reflected in taxes other than income.             Gas Distribution Tax Repair             The decrease in gas distribution tax repair reflects the 2012 tax benefit received from prior period gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. There is an equal and offsetting tax benefit in operating
revenues, see NOTE 3 Regulatory Matters for further explanation.         
   Other             The decrease in other electric revenues net of purchased power expense compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 reflects a decrease in wholesale transmission revenues earned by PECO due to higher peak
loads in the previous years.            The changes in PECO s
operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 consisted of the following:   

132   

Weather          
  Electric and gas revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense were lower due to unfavorable winter weather conditions during 2012 in PECO s
service territory.            The changes in heating and cooling
degree days in PECO s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 and normal weather consisted of the following:   
     
           Volume    
        The decrease in electric revenues net of purchased power expense
related to delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflected the reduced oil refinery load in PECO s service territory and the impact of energy efficiency initiatives and weak economic conditions on customer usage. See Note 3 of
the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding energy efficiency initiatives.         
   Pricing          
  The decrease in electric operating revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of pricing is primarily attributable to lower overall
effective rates due to increased usage across all major customer classes.         
   Regulatory Required Programs          
  This represents the change in operating revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the smart meter, energy efficiency
and consumer education programs as well as the administrative costs for the GSA and AEPS programs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. The offsetting costs of these programs are included in
operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and income taxes. Refer to the operating and maintenance expense discussion below for additional information on included programs.   
         Other    
        The decrease in other electric revenues net of purchased power expense
primarily reflected a decrease in GRT revenues as a result of lower supplied energy service and a reduction in the GRT rate. There is an equal and offsetting decrease in GRT expense included in taxes other than income.   
         133   

Operating and Maintenance Expense     

(a)  
  Operating and maintenance expenses for regulatory required programs are costs for various legislative and/or regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and
current basis through approved regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues.           
  The changes in operating and maintenance expense for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 consisted of the following:   

(a)  
  Storm-related costs include $46 million of incremental storm costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of Hurricane Sandy. This expense was significantly offset by
the costs incurred related to Hurricane Irene and other storms throughout 2011.                Depreciation and Amortization Expense               Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense, net for 2013, compared to 2012 was primarily due to ongoing capital
expenditures.             Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense, net for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures.   
         134   

Taxes Other Than Income              The change in taxes other than income for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 consisted of the following:

(a)  
  The decrease reflects a sales and use tax reserve adjustment in the first quarter of 2012 resulting from the completion of the audit of tax years 2005 through 2010.
               Interest Expense, Net
              Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The decrease in interest expense, net for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to refinancing debt at lower interest rates during the second half of 2012.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2011.  The decrease in interest expense, net for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the debt retirement in November 2011.         
    Other, Net           
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  Other, net remained relatively level between periods.
            Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2011.  The decrease in Other, net for 2012 compared to 2011 was due to decreased AFUDC Equity. See Note 20 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 10-K for additional details of the components
of Other, net.              Effective Income Tax Rate
             PECO s effective income tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 29.1%, 25.0% and 27.3%, respectively. The increase in effective income tax rate in 2013 compared 2012 reflects the 2012 impact of the tax benefit received from electing to change the method of
accounting for gas distribution property for the 2011 tax year. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.

Results of Operations BGE    

(a)  
  BGE evaluates its operating performance using the measures of revenues net of purchased power expense for electric sales and revenues net of fuel expense for gas sales. BGE
believes revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense are useful measurements of its performance because they provide information that can be used to evaluate its net revenues from operations. BGE has included the analysis below as a complement
to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense figures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or more
useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.                Net Income           
   Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012.  The increase in net income was driven primarily by higher
distribution rates as a result of the 2012 rate order issued by MDPSC and decreased operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense in 2012 related to the accrual of the residential customer rate credit provided as a condition of the
MDPSC s approval of Exelon s merger with Constellation. Additionally, the increase in net income was also driven by higher operating and maintenance expenses in 2012, primarily related to BGE s accrual of its portion of the charitable
contributions to be provided as a condition of the MDPSC s approval of the merger and lower storm restoration costs in 2013.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The decrease in net income was driven primarily by decreased
operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense related to the residential customer rate credit provided as a condition of the MDPSC s approval of Exelon s merger with Constellation. The decrease in net income was also driven by
increased operating and maintenance expenses, primarily related to BGE s accrual of its portion of the charitable contributions to be provided as a condition of the MDPSC s approval of the merger as well
  
         137   

as merger transaction costs, and increased depreciation and amortization expense. None of the customer rate credit, the charitable contributions, or the transaction costs are recoverable from
BGE s customers.              Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power and
Fuel Expense                   There are certain
drivers to operating revenue that are offset by their impact on purchased power expense and fuel expense, such as commodity procurement costs and programs allowing customers to select a competitive electric or natural gas supplier. Electric and gas
revenues and purchased power and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in commodity procurement costs. BGE s electric and natural gas rates charged to customers are subject to periodic adjustments that are designed to recover or refund the
difference between the actual cost of purchased electric power and purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the MDPSC s market-based SOS and gas commodity programs, respectively.   
        The number of customers electing to select a competitive electric
generation supplier affects electric SOS revenues and purchased power expense. The number of customers electing to select a competitive natural gas supplier affects gas cost adjustment revenues and purchased natural gas expense. All BGE customers
have the choice to purchase energy from a competitive electric generation supplier. This customer choice of electric generation suppliers does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to SOS. The
number of retail customers purchasing electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier was 399,000, 362,000 and 314,000 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing 32%, 29% and 25% of total retail customers,
respectively. Retail deliveries purchased from competitive electric generation suppliers represented 61%, 60% and 58% of BGE s retail kWh sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The number of retail
customers purchasing natural gas from a competitive natural gas supplier was 172,000, 143,000 and 118,000 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing 26%, 22% and 18% of total retail customers, respectively. Retail
deliveries purchased from competitive natural gas suppliers represented 54%, 56% and 52% of BGE s retail mmcf sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   
        The changes in BGE s operating revenues net of purchased power and
fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  In accordance with the MDPSC order approving Exelon s merger with Constellation, the residential customer rate credit is not recoverable from BGE s customers. Exelon
made a $66 million equity contribution to BGE in the second quarter of 2012 to fund the after-tax amount of the rate credit as directed in the MDPSC order approving the merger transaction.     
         Revenue Decoupling.  The demand for electricity and gas is
affected by weather and usage conditions. The MDPSC has allowed BGE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas distribution revenues from all residential customers, commercial electric customers, the majority of large industrial electric
customers, and all firm service gas customers to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on BGE s electric and gas distribution volumes, thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per
customer, by customer class,   
         138   

regardless of changes in consumption levels. This allows BGE to recognize revenues at MDPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what BGE s actual distribution volumes were for a
billing period. Therefore, while these revenues are affected by customer growth, they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions. BGE bills or credits impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved
revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings.            Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree
days for a 30-year period in BGE s service territory. The changes in heating degree days in BGE s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and normal weather consisted of the
following:         
           2012 Residential Customer Rate Credit.
            The increase in operating revenues net of purchased
power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was due to the residential customer rate credit provided in 2012 as a result of the MDPSC s order approving Exelon s merger with
Constellation.             Pricing.    
        The increase in operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel
expense as a result of pricing for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the new electric and natural gas distribution rates charged to customers that became effective
February 23, 2013 and December 13, 2013 in accordance with the MDPSC approved electric and natural gas distribution rate case order. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.             Regulatory Required Programs.    
        This represents the change in revenues collected under approved riders
to recover costs incurred for the energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as administrative and commercial and industrial customer bad debt costs for SOS. The riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in
certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes. The increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to the same period in 2012 was due to the recovery of higher energy efficiency program costs.             Other .            
  Other revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Other revenues, which can vary from
period to period, include miscellaneous revenues such as service application and late payment fees.   
         139   

The changes in BGE s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year
ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 consisted of the following:         
          The changes in heating and cooling
degree days for the twelve months ended 2012 and 2011, consisted of the following:         
           2012 Residential Customer Rate Credit
            The residential customer rate credit provided as a
result of the MDPSC s order approving Exelon s merger with Constellation decreased operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.   
         Commodity Margin             The commodity margin for both electric and gas revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared
to the same period in 2011 due to an increase in the number of customers using competitive suppliers in 2012.             Regulatory Required Programs             This represents the change in revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for the energy efficiency and demand response programs as well as administrative and commercial and industrial
customer bad debt costs for SOS. The riders are designed to provide full recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and
taxes other than income taxes. The increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was due to the recovery of higher energy efficiency programs costs.   
         Transmission             Transmission revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to
higher revenue requirements. BGE s transmission rates are established based on a FERC-approved formula. The rates also include transmission investment incentives approved by FERC in a number of orders covering various new transmission
investment projects since 2007.   
         140   

Other          
  Other revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Other revenues, which can vary from
period to period, include miscellaneous revenues such as service application and late payment fees.              Operating and Maintenance Expense              The changes in operating and maintenance expense for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 consisted of the following:   

(a)  
  During the first quarter of 2012, BGE accrued $28 million in charitable contributions as a result of BGE s merger-related commitments. The charitable contribution accrual
and merger costs are not recoverable from BGE s customers.     

(b)  
  During the first quarter of 2011, the MDPSC issued a comprehensive rate order permitting the deferral of incremental distribution service restoration expenses associated with
2010 storms as a regulatory asset.     

(c)  
  On June 29, 2012, a  Derecho  storm caused extensive damage to BGE s electric distribution system and created power outages that lasted multiple days. As a
result, BGE incurred $62 million of incremental costs during the year ended December 31, 2012, of which $20 million are capital costs. In the fourth quarter of 2012, BGE incurred $38 million of incremental costs as a result of Hurricane Sandy,
of which $14 million are capital costs. These amounts compare to $40 million of incremental expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2011 associated with Hurricane Irene, of which $25 million are capital costs, and $14 million of incremental
expenses, of which $3 are capital costs, incurred during the first quarter of 2011.                Depreciation and Amortization Expense              The changes in depreciation and amortization expense for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 consisted of the following:   

(a)  
  Deprecation and amortization expense increased due to higher plant balances year over year.     

(b)  
  Regulatory asset amortization increased due to higher energy efficiency and demand response programs expenditures year over year     
         141   

Taxes Other Than Income              The change in taxes other than income for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 consisted of the following:
        
            Interest Expense, Net     
         Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2012.  The decrease in interest expense, net for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the interest recorded in 2012 on prior year tax liabilities and lower effective interest rates as a result of the refinancing of debt at
a lower interest rate in 2013.             Year Ended
December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011.  The increase in interest expense, net in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and interest recorded in 2012 on prior year tax
liabilities.              Effective Income Tax Rate
             BGE s effective income tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 39.0%, 63.6% and 35.5%, respectively. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax
rates.              BGE Electric Operating Statistics and Revenue Detail

customers are assessed distribution charges. The cost of natural gas is charged to customers purchasing natural gas from BGE.     
 
         143   

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
        Exelon s and Generation s prior year activity presented
below includes the activity of Constellation, and BGE in the case of Exelon, from the merger effective date of March 12, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Exelon s and Generation s activity for 2011 is unadjusted for the effects of
the merger. BGE s prior year activity presented below includes its activity for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.         
  The Registrants  operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as
funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each Registrant s access to external financing on reasonable
terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital
markets at reasonable terms, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $0.5 billion, $5.3 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.
The Registrants  revolving credit facilities are in place until 2018. In addition, Generation has $0.4 billion in bilateral facilities with banks which expire in January 2015, December 2015 and March 2016. The Registrants utilize their
credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. See the  Credit Matters  section below for further discussion. The Registrants expect cash flows to be
sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.            The Registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, ComEd, PECO and BGE operate in
rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of the Registrants  debt and credit agreements.         
    Cash Flows from Operating Activities           
   General          
  Generation s cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to
customers. Generation s future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections
from customers.            ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s
cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO and BGE, gas distribution services. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s distribution services are provided to
an established and diverse base of retail customers. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their
rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.            See Notes 3 and 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.   
         144   

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits    
        Management considers various factors when making pension funding
decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, management of the pension obligation
and regulatory implications. On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the Twenty-first Century Act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower pension contributions in the near term
while increasing the premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Certain provisions of the law were applied in 2012 while others take effect in 2013. The estimated impacts of the law are reflected in the projected pension
contributions below.            Exelon expects to contribute
approximately $264 million to its pension plans in 2014, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE expect to contribute $118 million, $119 million, $11 million and $0 million, respectively. See Note 16 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the Registrants  2013 and 2012 pension contributions.            Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon s other postretirement plans are not subject to regulatory minimum contribution requirements. Management considers several factors in determining the level of
contributions to Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued recovery). Exelon expects to
contribute approximately $430 million to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2014, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE expect to contribute $168 million, $197 million, $19 million and $17 million, respectively. See Note 16 of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Registrants  2013 and 2012 other postretirement benefit contributions.         
  See the  Contractual Obligations  section below for management s estimated future pension and other postretirement benefits
contributions.             Tax Matters    
        The Registrants  future cash flows from operating activities may
be affected by the following tax matters:         

Given the current economic environment, state and local governments are facing increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income
tax levies, property taxes and other taxes.            

In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. The newly
adopted method results in a cash tax benefit in 2012 of approximately $38 million and $41 million at Exelon and PECO, respectively. Exelon currently anticipates that the IRS will issue industry guidance in the near future. See Note 3 of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the regulatory treatment of PECO s tax benefits from the application of the method change.      
         145   

The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting Exelon s cash flows from
operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         

(a)  
  Represents depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, net fair value changes related to derivatives, deferred income taxes, provision for uncollectible accounts,
pension and non-pension postretirement benefit expense, equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates and investments, decommissioning-related items, stock compensation expense, impairment of long-lived assets, and other non-cash
charges.     

(b)  
  Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion of long-term debt.
             Cash flows provided by operations for 2013,
2012 and 2011 by Registrant were as follows:         

(a)  
  Exelon s and Generation s prior year activity includes the activity of Constellation, and BGE in the case of Exelon, from the merger effective date of March 12,
2012 through December 31, 2012. Exelon s and Generation s activity for 2011 is unadjusted for the effects of the merger. BGE s prior year activity includes its activity for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
             Changes in Exelon s, Generation s,
ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each Registrant s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business. In
addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:         
   Generation          

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, Generation had net (payments) receipts of counterparty collateral of $162 million, $95 million and $(410) million, respectively. Net
payments during 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to market conditions that resulted in changes to Generation s net mark-to-market position. Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may
be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. This collateral may be in various forms, such as cash, which may be obtained through the issuance of commercial paper, or letters of credit.      

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, Generation s accounts receivable from ComEd increased (decreased) by $(16) million, $(15) million and $12 million, respectively,
primarily due to changes in receivables for energy purchases related to its SFC, ICC-approved RFP contracts and financial swap contract.      
         146   

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, Generation had net payments of approximately $36 million, $114 million and $3 million, respectively, related to purchases and sales
of options. The level of option activity in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.                ComEd          

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, ComEd s net payables to Generation for energy purchases related to its supplier forward contract, ICC-approved RFP contracts and
financial swap contract settlements increased (decreased) by $(16) million, $(15) million and $12 million, respectively. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, ComEd s payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased (decreased) by $35
million, $20 million and $(43) million, respectively.            
 
         PECO          
 
         BGE          

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, BGE s payables to Generation for energy purchases increased (decreased) by $(4) million, $23 million and $(13) million,
respectively, and payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased (decreased) by $5 million, $40 million and $(60) million, respectively.      
          Cash Flows from Investing Activities     
        Cash flows used in investing activities for 2013, 2012, and 2011 by
Registrant were as follows:         
 
         147   

Capital expenditures by Registrant for 2013, 2012 and 2011 and projected amounts for 2014 are as
follows:         

(a)  
  Includes $387 million in 2011 related to acquisitions, principally acquisition of Wolf Hollow, Antelope Valley and Shooting Star. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.     

(b)  
  Total projected capital expenditures do not include adjustments for non-cash activity.     

(c)  
  Includes nuclear fuel.     

(d)  
  Pursuant to EIMA, ComEd has committed to invest approximately $2.6 billion over a ten year period to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart
grid technology. ComEd expects to file an updated investment plan with the ICC in April, 2014.     

(e)  
  Other primarily consists of corporate operations and BSC.     

(f)  
  Exelon s and Generation s prior year activity includes the activity of Constellation, and BGE in the case of Exelon, from the merger effective date of March 12,
2012 through December 31, 2012. Exelon s and Generation s activity for 2011 is unadjusted for the effects of the merger. BGE s prior year activity includes its activity for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
             Projected capital expenditures and other
investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.         
   Generation            
  Approximately 38% and 11% of the projected 2014 capital expenditures at Generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel and investments in
renewable energy generation, including Antelope Valley construction costs, respectively, with the remaining amounts reflecting additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling
outages). Also included in the projected 2014 capital expenditures are a portion of the costs of a series of planned power uprates across Generation s nuclear fleet. See  EXELON CORPORATION Executive Overview,  for more
information on nuclear uprates.            On November 30, 2012,
a subsidiary of Generation sold three Maryland generating stations and associated assets to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Riverstone Holdings LLC, and received net proceeds of approximately $371. In addition, Generation will begin to
make cash payments of approximately $31 million to Raven Power Holdings LLC over a twelve-month period beginning in June 2014. In 2012, Generation incurred transaction costs of approximately $15 million through the date of closing of the
transaction. The sale will generate approximately $195 million of cash tax benefits, of which $155 million will be realized in periods through 2014 with the balance to be received in later years. Therefore, Generation expects net after-tax cash sale
proceeds of approximately $495 million through 2014 and approximately $36 million in subsequent years.         
   ComEd, PECO and BGE             
  Approximately 91%, 72% and 89% of the projected 2014 capital expenditures at ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, are for continuing projects to
maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as ComEd s reliability related investments required under EIMA, and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s
  
         148   

construction commitments under PJM s RTEP. ComEd s capital expenditures include smart grid/smart meter technology required under EIMA. PECO and BGE capital expenditures include
investments related to their respective smart meter program and SGIG project, net of DOE expected reimbursements. The remaining amounts are for capital additions to support new business and customer growth. See Notes 3 and 7 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
  In 2010, NERC provided guidance to transmission owners, including ComEd, PECO, and BGE, that recommends the completion of performance assessments of
their transmission lines, with the highest priority lines assessed by December 31, 2011, medium priority lines by December 31, 2012, and the lowest priority lines by December 31, 2013. In compliance with this guidance, ComEd, PECO and
BGE submitted their most recent bi-annual reports to NERC in January 2014. ComEd, PECO and BGE will incur incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the assessments. Specific projects and expenditures
are identified as the assessments are completed. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s forecasted 2014 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed in 2014.   
        ComEd, PECO and BGE anticipate that they will fund capital expenditures
with internally generated funds and borrowings, including ComEd s capital expenditures associated with EIMA as further discussed in Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

151   

(a)  
  Represents debt obligations assumed by Exelon as part of the merger on March 12, 2012 that became callable at face value on June 15, 2013. Exelon and subsidiaries of
Generation (former Constellation subsidiaries) assumed intercompany loan agreements that mirror the terms and amounts of the third-party debt obligations of Exelon, resulting in intercompany notes payable as of December 31, 2012 included in
long-term debt to affiliate on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes receivable from affiliates at Exelon Corporate, which are eliminated in consolidation on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The third-party debt
obligations were reported in Long-term Debt on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. The debentures were redeemed and the intercompany loan agreements repaid on June 15, 2013.     
        From time to time and as market conditions warrant, the Registrants may
engage in long-term debt retirements via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable options to reduce debt on their respective balance sheets.         
    Dividends.   Cash dividend payments and distributions during 2013, 2012 and 2011 by Registrant were as follows:   

(a)  
  Dividends on common stock for $85 million were paid to Constellation for the year ended December 31, 2011.     
         152   

Revised Dividend Policy     
        On February 6, 2013, the Exelon board of directors approved a
revised dividend policy which contemplates a regular $0.31 per share quarterly dividend on Exelon s common stock payable beginning in the second quarter of 2013 (or $1.24 per share on an annualized basis), subject to quarterly declarations by
the Exelon Board of Directors.              Second Quarter 2013 Dividend
             On April 23, 2013, the Exelon board of
directors declared a regular quarterly dividend, paid on June 10, 2013 of $0.310 per share on Exelon s common stock.         
    Third Quarter 2013 Dividend           
  On July 23, 2013, the Exelon board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend, paid on September 10, 2013 of $0.310 per share on
Exelon s common stock.              Fourth Quarter 2013 Dividend
             On October 22, 2013, the Exelon board of
directors declared a regular quarterly dividend, paid on December 10, 2013 of $0.310 per share on Exelon s common stock         
    First Quarter 2014 Dividend           
  On January 28, 2014, the Exelon Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2014 regular quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share on Exelon s
common stock payable on March 10, 2014, to shareholders of record of Exelon at the end of the day on February 14, 2014.         
    Short-Term Borrowings.   Short-term borrowings incurred (repaid) during 2013, 2012 and 2011 by Registrant were as follows:

(a)  
  Other primarily consists of corporate operations and BSC.           
    Retirement of Long-Term Debt to Financing Affiliates.   There were no retirements of long-term debt to financing affiliates during
2013, 2012 and 2011 by the Registrants.              Contributions
from Parent/Member.   Contributions from Parent/Member (Exelon) during 2013, 2012 and 2011 by Registrant were as follows:         

(a)  
  In 2013, represents indemnification from Exelon in relation to the like-kind exchange transaction.     
         153   

Other.   Other significant financing activities for Exelon for 2013, 2012 and 2011
were as follows:         
            Credit Matters     
         Market Conditions    
        The Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working
capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include $8.4 billion in aggregate
total commitments of which $6.6 billion was available as of December 31, 2013, and of which no financial institution has more than 8% of the aggregate commitments for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. The Registrants had access to the
commercial paper market during 2013 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing
various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the
financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See PART I. ITEM 1A Risk Factors for
further information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.            The Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If Generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of
December 31, 2013, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of $2.0 billion of collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of
the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of $4.3 billion. If ComEd lost its investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2013, it would have
been required to provide incremental collateral of $6 million, which is well within its current available credit facility capacity of $816 million, which takes into account commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2013. If PECO lost its
investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2013 it would not be required to provide collateral pursuant to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $42 million related to its natural gas procurement
contracts, which, in the aggregate, are well within PECO s current available credit facility capacity of $599 million. If BGE lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2013, it would have been required to provide
collateral of $2 million pursuant to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of $85 million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which, in the aggregate, are well within BGE s current available
credit facility capacity of $465 million.             Exelon Credit
Facilities             See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Registrants  credit facilities and short term borrowing activity.   
         154   

Other Credit Matters    
          Capital Structure   .  At December 31, 2013, the
capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Includes approximately $648 million, $206 million, $184 million and $258 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE respectively. These special
purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd, PECO and BGE. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
authoritative guidance for VIEs.           
    Intercompany Money Pool.   To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing
participants than the cost of external financing, Exelon operates an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participants during the year ended December 31, 2013, in addition to the net
contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2013, are presented in the following table:         
            Investments in Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust Funds.   Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning Generation s nuclear plants. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide
returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to offset inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocations in accordance with
Generation s NDT fund investment policy. Generation s investment policy establishes limits on the concentration of holdings in any one company and also in any one industry. See Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the trust funds, the NRC s minimum funding requirements and related liquidity ramifications.              Shelf Registration Statements.   The Registrants maintain a combined shelf registration statement unlimited
in amount, with the SEC. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required
regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.         
    Regulatory Authorizations.   The issuance by ComEd, PECO and BGE of long-term debt or equity securities requires the prior authorization
of the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, respectively. ComEd, PECO and BGE normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing. On March 1,
2013, ComEd received $470 million in long-term debt new money authority from the ICC and on February 27, 2012, ComEd received $1.3 billion in long-term debt refinancing authority from the ICC.
  
         155   

As of December 31, 2013, ComEd had $1.3 billion available in long-term debt refinancing authority and $218 million available in new money long-term debt financing authority from the ICC.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, ComEd requested and received $1 billion in new money financing authority from the ICC. The authority is effective on January 1, 2014 and expires January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2013, PECO
had $1.4 billion available in long-term debt financing authority from the PAPUC. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had $850 million available in long-term financing authority from MDPSC.            FERC has financing jurisdiction over ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s short-term financings and all of
Generation s financings. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd, PECO had BGE had short-term financing authority from FERC, which expires on December 31, 2015, of $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $700 million, respectively. Generation currently
has blanket financing authority it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate authority. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        Exelon s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on
the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. The Federal Power Act
declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  In addition, under Illinois
law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless ComEd has specific
authorization from the ICC. BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on
its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three
major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common
stock dividends unless: (1) BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on
BGE s preference stock have not been paid. At December 31, 2013, Exelon had retained earnings of $10,358 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $3,613 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $750 million
consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $2,389 million partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, PECO s retained earnings of $649 million and BGE s retained earnings $1,005 million.
See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding fund transfer restrictions.   
         156   

Contractual Obligations    
        The following tables summarize the Registrants  future estimated
cash payments as of December 31, 2013 under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Registrants 
commercial and other commitments, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events.             Exelon          

(b)  
  Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2013 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early
redemptions or debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2013. Includes estimated interest payments due to ComEd, PECO and BGE financing trusts.     

(c)  
  As of December 31, 2013, Exelon s liability for uncertain tax positions and related interest payable was $906 million and $349 million, respectively. Exelon was unable
to reasonably estimate the timing of liability and interest payments and receipts in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. Exelon has other unrecognized tax positions that
were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with authoritative guidance. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding unrecognized tax positions.

(d)  
  Excludes PPAs and other capacity contracts that are accounted for as operating leases. These amounts are included within purchase power obligations. Includes estimated cash
payments for service fees related to PECO s meter reading operating lease.     

(e)  
  Purchase power obligations include PPAs and other capacity contracts including those that are accounted for as operating leases. Amounts presented represent Generation s
expected payments under these arrangements at December 31, 2013, including those related to CENG. Expected payments include certain fixed capacity charges which may be reduced based on plant availability. Expected payments exclude renewable PPA
contracts that are contingent in nature. These obligations do not include ComEd s SFCs as these contracts do not require purchases of fixed or minimum quantities. See Notes 3 and 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(f)  
  Represents commitments to purchase nuclear fuel, natural gas and related transportation, storage capacity and services, procure electric supply, and purchase AECs and curtailment
services. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for electric and gas purchase commitments.     

(g)  
    ComEd entered into 20-year contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to recover its renewable energy and REC costs from
retail customers with no mark-up. The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing contract terms. Pursuant to the
     
         157   

ICC s December 19, 2012 order, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. The ICC s
December 18, 2013 order approved the reduction of ComEd s commitments under the long-term contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, however the amount of the reduction will not be finalized and approved by the ICC
until March 2014. See Note 3 of Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 7A.   
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            
  The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity
prices. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief risk officer and
includes the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, corporate controller, general counsel, treasurer, vice president of strategy, vice president of audit services and officers representing Exelon s business units. The RMC reports to
the risk oversight committee of the Exelon board of directors on the scope of the risk management activities.               Commodity Price Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather
conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon has price risk from commodity price movements.
Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel, and other commodities.         
    Generation           
    Normal Operations and Hedging Activities.   Electricity available from Generation s owned or contracted generation supply in
excess of Generation s obligations to customers, including portions of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into
non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate
exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2014 through 2016.         
  In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and
contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity risk on a ratable basis over the three years leading to the spot market. As of December 31, 2013, the percentage of expected generation hedged for
the major reportable segments was 92%-95%, 62%-65% and 30%-33% for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation
represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts including sales to
ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.            A portion
of Generation s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of
unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation s entire non-trading portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2013, market conditions
and hedged position would be a decrease in pre-tax net income of approximately $30 million, $520 million and $820 million, respectively, for 2014, 2015 and 2016. Power price sensitivities are derived by
  
         161   

adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation expects to actively manage its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged
position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation s portfolio.   
          Proprietary Trading Activities.   Generation also
enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the
intent of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits,
including volume, stop loss and Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the Exelon risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the proprietary trading activities. The proprietary
trading activities, which included physical volumes of 8,762 GWh, 12,958 GWh, and 5,742 GWh for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio, but represent a
small portion of Generation s overall revenue from energy marketing activities. Trading portfolio activity for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulted in pre-tax losses of $8 million due to net mark-to-market losses of $39 million and
realized gains of $31 million. Generation uses a 95% confidence interval, assuming standard normal distribution, one day holding period, one-tailed statistical measure in calculating its VaR. The daily VaR on proprietary trading activity averaged
$1.0 million of exposure during the year. Generation has not segregated proprietary trading activity within the following discussion because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to Generation s total
gross margin from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $7,433 million.         
    Fuel Procurement  . Generation procures coal and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases.
Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained primarily through long-term contracts for uranium concentrates, and long-term contracts for conversion services, enrichment services and fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for coal, natural gas,
uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential
non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 60% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2014 through 2018 are supplied by three producers. In the event
of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by
these counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding uranium and coal supply agreement matters.         
    ComEd           
  The financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd was deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, thereby ensuring that ComEd
would be entitled to receive full cost recovery in rates. The change in fair value each period was recorded by ComEd with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability. This financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd expired on May 31,
2013. All realized impacts have been included in Generation s and ComEd s results of operations.         
  ComEd entered into 20-year contracts for renewable energy and RECs beginning in June 2012. ComEd is permitted to recover its renewable energy and
REC costs from retail customers with no mark-up. The annual commitments represent the maximum settlements with suppliers for renewable energy and RECs under the existing contract terms. Pursuant to the ICC s Order on December 19,
  
         162   

2012, ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts were reduced for the June 2013 through May 2014 procurement period. The ICC s December 18, 2013 order approved the
reduction of ComEd s commitments under the long-term contracts for the June 2014 through May 2015 procurement period, however the amount of the reduction will not be finalized and approved by the ICC until March 2014. See Notes 3 and 12 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding energy procurement and derivatives.         
    PECO           
  PECO has contracts to procure electric supply that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP
Programs, which are further discussed in Note 3 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO s full requirements contracts and block contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the normal purchases and
normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance and as a result, are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Under the DSP Programs, PECO is permitted to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail
customers with no mark-up.            PECO has also entered into
derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge its long-term price risk in the natural gas market.
PECO s hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on its financial position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.   
        PECO does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary
trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
    BGE           
  BGE procures electric supply for default service customers through full requirements contracts pursuant to BGE s MDPSC-approved SOS program.
BGE s full requirements contracts that are considered derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance and as a result, are accounted for on an accrual basis of
accounting. Under the SOS program, BGE is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers, plus an administrative fee which includes a shareholder return component and an incremental cost component. However, through
December 2016, BGE provides all residential electric customers a credit for the residential shareholder return component of the administrative charge.         
  BGE has also entered into derivative natural gas contracts, which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception, to hedge its
price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on BGE s financial position. However, under BGE s market-based rates incentive mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared
to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers.   
        BGE does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary
trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
    Trading and Non-Trading Marketing Activities           
  The following detailed presentation of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s trading and non-trading marketing activities
is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industry s Committee of Chief Risk Officers (CCRO).   
         163   

The following table provides detail on changes in Exelon s, Generation s, and ComEd s
mark-to-market net asset or liability balance sheet position from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. It indicates the drivers behind changes in the balance sheet amounts. This table incorporates the mark-to-market activities that are
immediately recorded in earnings, as well as the settlements from OCI to earnings and changes in fair value for the cash flow hedging activities that are recorded in accumulated OCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This table excludes all normal
purchase and normal sales contracts and does not segregate proprietary trading activity. See Note 12 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the balance sheet classification of the mark-to-market energy
contract net assets (liabilities) recorded as of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.         

(a)  
  Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties.     

(b)  
  Amounts related to the five-year financial swap between Generation and ComEd.     

(c)  
  For Generation, includes $660 million of collateral paid to counterparties, offset by $520 million of unrealized losses on commodity derivative positions.
    
         164   

(d)  
  For Generation, reflects $5 million of changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.     

(e)  
  For Generation, includes $219 million and $621 million of losses from reclassifications from accumulated OCI to recognize gains in net income related to settlements of the
five-year financial swap contract with ComEd for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.     

(f)  
  For Generation, includes $146 million of gains related to the changes in fair value of the five-year financial swap with ComEd for the year ended 2012. Effective prior to the
merger with Constellation, the five-year financial swap between Generation and ComEd was de-designated as a cash flow hedge. As a result, all changes in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2013 were recorded to operating revenues and
eliminated in consolidation.     

(g)  
  For ComEd, the changes in fair value are recorded as a change in regulatory assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, ComEd recorded a regulatory liability of
$193 million and $293 million, respectively, related to its mark-to-market derivative liabilities with Generation and unaffiliated suppliers. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, this includes $11 million of decreases and $98 million of increases
in fair value, respectively, and $215 million and $566 million, respectively, for reclassifications from regulatory assets to recognize cost in purchase power expense due to settlements of ComEd s five-year financial swap with Generation. As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012 ComEd also recorded $126 million and $34 million, respectively, of increases in fair value, and $7 million and $5 million, respectively, of realized losses due to settlements associated with floating-to-fixed energy
swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     

(h)  
  Includes $104 million and $160 million of amounts reclassified to realized at settlement of contracts recorded to results of operations related to option premiums due to the
settlement of the underlying transactions for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.     

(i)  
  Includes the ending balance related to interest rate derivative contracts and foreign exchange currency swaps to manage the exposure related to the interest rate component of
commodity positions and international purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. Dollars.                Fair Values           
  The following tables present maturity and source of fair value for Exelon, Generation and ComEd mark-to-market commodity contract net assets
(liabilities). The tables provide two fundamental pieces of information. First, the tables provide the source of fair value used in determining the carrying amount of the Registrants  total mark-to-market net assets (liabilities), net of
allocated collateral. Second, the tables show the maturity, by year, of the Registrants  commodity contract net assets (liabilities) net of allocated collateral, giving an indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and either
generate or require cash. See Note 11 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy.
             Exelon     

(a)  
  Mark-to-market gains and losses on other economic hedge and trading derivative contracts that are recorded in results of operations.     

(b)  
  Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties (and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities) of $144 million at December 31, 2013.

(c)  
  Includes ComEd s net assets (liabilities) associated with the floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     
         165   

Generation     

(a)  
  Mark-to-market gains and losses on other economic hedge and trading derivative contracts that are recorded in the results of operations.     

(b)  
  Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties (and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities) of $144 million at December 31, 2013.
               ComEd     

(a)  
  Represents ComEd s net liabilities associated with the floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     
         Credit Risk, Collateral, and Contingent Related Features (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             The Registrants would be exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See
Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail discussion of credit risk, collateral, and contingent related features.   
         166   

Generation     
        The following tables provide information on Generation s credit
exposure for all derivative instruments, normal purchase normal sales agreements, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2013. The tables
further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company s credit risk by credit rating of the
counterparties. The figures in the tables below do not include credit risk exposure from uranium procurement contracts or exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE, and Nodal commodity exchanges, which are discussed below. Additionally, the figures in
the tables below do not include exposures with affiliates, including net receivables with ComEd, PECO and BGE of $38 million, $38 million and $27 million, respectively. See Note 25 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.         

(a)  
  As of December 31, 2013, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $155 million of cash and $29 million of letters of credit.
    
         167   

ComEd     
        Credit risk for ComEd is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. ComEd is currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. ComEd records a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical
experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of
procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation as well as the ICC-approved procurement tariffs. ComEd will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. The
Illinois Settlement Legislation prohibits utilities, including ComEd, from terminating electric service to a residential electric space heat customer due to nonpayment between December 1 of any year through March 1 of the following year.
ComEd s ability to disconnect non space-heating residential customers is also impacted by certain weather restrictions, at any time of year, under the Illinois Public Utilities Act. ComEd will monitor the impact of its disconnection practices
and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. ComEd did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2013. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding ComEd s recently approved tariffs to adjust rates annually through a rider mechanism to reflect increases or decreases in annual uncollectible accounts expense.   
        ComEd s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a
certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of
supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the
contract. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents ComEd s net credit exposure. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. As of December 31,
2013, ComEd s credit exposure to energy suppliers was immaterial.              PECO           
  Credit risk for PECO is managed by credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. PECO is currently
obligated to provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. PECO records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for uncollectible accounts policy. In accordance with PAPUC regulations, after November 30 and before April 1, an electric distribution utility or natural gas distribution utility
shall not terminate service to customers with household incomes at or below 250% of the Federal poverty level. PECO s provision for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in prices as well as changes in PAPUC
regulations. PECO did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2013.         
  PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP Program contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance
requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the
supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the
forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2013, PECO had no net
credit exposure with suppliers.   
         168   

PECO does not obtain cash collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management
agreements. As of December 31, 2013, PECO had credit exposure of $9 million under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers.   
          BGE     
        Credit risk for BGE is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. BGE is currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. BGE records a provision for uncollectible accounts to provide for the potential loss
from nonpayment by these customers. BGE will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
uncollectible accounts policy. MDPSC regulations prohibit BGE from terminating service to residential customers due to nonpayment from November 1 through March 31 if the forecasted temperature is 32 degrees or below for the subsequent 72
hour period. BGE is also prohibited by the Maryland Public Utilities Article and MDPSC regulations from terminating service to residential customers due to nonpayment if the forecasted temperature is 95 degrees or above for the subsequent 72
hour period. BGE did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2013.         
  BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a
supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest
credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a
transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is
greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had no net credit exposure with suppliers.   
        BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This
market-price risk is mitigated by BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make off-system sales after BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are not
covered by the gas cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2013, BGE had credit exposure of $14 million related to off-system sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or right to offset clauses within other contracts
with those third-party suppliers.              Collateral (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)                Generation
             As part of the normal course of business,
Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel and other commodities. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit Generation and its counterparties to
demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level
below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation s net position with a counterparty, the
demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of
the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount   
         169   

of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into
the disclosure below. See Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding collateral requirements.         
  Generation sells output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of
counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As
market prices rise above contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation. In order to post
collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        As of December 31, 2013, Generation had cash collateral of $72
million posted and cash collateral held of $206 million for counterparties with derivative positions, of which $144 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, $10
million of cash collateral posted was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives. As of December 31, 2012, Generation had cash collateral held of $499 million and cash collateral
posted of $527 million for counterparties with derivative positions, of which $31 million in net cash collateral deposits were offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2012, $3 million of cash collateral received
was not offset against net mark-to-market assets and liabilities because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives. See Note 22 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the letters of credit
supporting the cash collateral.              ComEd
             As of December 31, 2013, ComEd held
immaterial amounts of cash and letters of credit for the purpose of collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts and held approximately $19 million in the form of cash for both annual and long-term renewable energy
contracts. See Notes 3 and 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
    PECO           
  As of December 31, 2013, PECO was not required to post collateral under its energy and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 12 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.              BGE              BGE
is not required to post collateral under its electric supply contracts. As of December 31, 2013, BGE was not required to post collateral under its natural gas procurement contracts, nor was it holding collateral under its electric supply and
natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
    RTOs and ISOs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)           
  Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE participate in all, or some, of the established, real-time energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE,
ISO-NY, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO and ERCOT. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers   
         170   

and on the spot markets that are operated by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For
sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances,
require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants 
results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.              Exchange
Traded Transactions (Exelon and Generation)           
  Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE and the Nodal exchange. The NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange clearinghouses act as the
counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on NYMEX, ICE and Nodal exchange are significantly collateralized and have
limited counterparty credit risk.              Long-Term Leases (Exelon)
             Exelon s consolidated balance sheet, as of
December 31, 2013, included a $698 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia and Texas subject to long-term leases. This investment represents the estimated residual value of leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms
of $1,465 million, less unearned income of $767 million. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the lease terms. If the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options, Exelon has the ability to require
the lessees to return the leasehold interests or to arrange for a third-party to bid on a service contract for a period following the lease term. If Exelon chooses the service contract option, the leasehold interests will be returned to Exelon at
the end of the term of the service contract. In any event, Exelon will be subject to residual value risk if the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options. This risk is partially mitigated by the fair value of the scheduled payments under
the service contract. However, such payments are not guaranteed. Further, the term of the service contract is less than the expected remaining useful life of the plants and, therefore, Exelon s exposure to residual value risk will not be
mitigated by payments under the service contract in this remaining period. Lessee performance under the lease agreements is supported by collateral and credit enhancement measures. Management regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of Exelon s
counterparties to these long-term leases. Exelon monitors the continuing credit quality of the credit enhancement party.         
  Pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance, Exelon is required to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments
at least annually and, if the review indicates a fair value below the carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary, must record an impairment charge in the period the estimate changed. Based on the review performed in the
second quarter of 2013, the estimated residual value of one of Exelon s direct financing leases experienced an other than temporary decline resulting in a $14 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of 2013. See Note 8 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Through December 31, 2013, no events have occurred that would require Exelon to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments
subsequent to the review performed in the second quarter of 2013.         
   Interest-Rate Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the   
         171   

Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to
manage interest rate risks. At December 31, 2013, Exelon had $1,425 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and $190 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges outstanding. Assuming the fair value and
cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in an approximate $5 million
decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.             Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)             Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning Generation s nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2013, Generation s decommissioning trust
funds are reflected at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in
decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors
the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a
$482 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for further discussion of equity price risk as a result of the current capital and credit market conditions.

  Generation s business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. Generation s capital resources are primarily
provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper, participation in the intercompany money pool or capital contributions from
Exelon. Generation s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to where Generation no
longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Generation has access to credit facilities in the aggregate of $5.6 billion that Generation currently utilizes to support its commercial paper program and to issue letters of credit.
           See the  EXELON CORPORATION Liquidity and Capital
Resources  and Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further discussion.         
  Capital resources are used primarily to fund Generation s capital requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, the payment of
distributions to Exelon, contributions to Exelon s pension plans and investments in new and existing ventures. Future acquisitions could require external financing or borrowings or capital contributions from Exelon.

   Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
        The management of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.         
  Exelon s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
assessment, Exelon s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, Exelon s internal control over financial reporting was effective.         
  The effectiveness of the Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
        To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Exelon Corporation:   
        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Exelon Corporation ( the Company ) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.            A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

           1. Significant Accounting Policies (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Description of Business (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Exelon is a utility services
holding company engaged through its principal subsidiaries in the energy generation and energy distribution businesses. Prior to March 12, 2012, Exelon s principal subsidiaries included ComEd, PECO and Generation. On March 12, 2012,
Constellation merged into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ). As a result of the merger transaction, Generation now
includes the former Constellation generation and customer supply operations. BGE, formerly Constellation s regulated utility subsidiary, is now a subsidiary of Exelon. Refer to Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions for further information
regarding the merger transaction.            The energy generation
business includes:         

Generation : Physical delivery and marketing of owned and contracted electric generation capacity and provision of renewable and other energy-related
products and services, and natural gas exploration and production activities. Generation has six reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other regions.      
        The energy delivery businesses include:   

ComEd : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in northern Illinois, including the
City of Chicago.            

PECO : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in southeastern Pennsylvania,
including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.      

BGE : Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services in central Maryland, including the City
of Baltimore, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore.                Basis of Presentation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             This is a combined annual report of Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements apply to Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE as indicated parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are named specifically for their related activities and
disclosures.            Exelon did not apply push-down accounting to
BGE and BGE continued to be subject to reporting requirements as an SEC registrant. The information disclosed for BGE represents the activity of the standalone entity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and the
financial position as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. However, for Exelon s consolidated financial reporting, Exelon is reporting BGE activity from the acquisition date of March 12, 2012 through December 31,
2013.            Each of the Registrant s Consolidated Financial
Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.   
         216   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of
support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. The costs of BSC, including support services, are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries using a
cost-causative allocation method. Corporate governance-type costs that cannot be directly assigned are allocated based on a Modified Massachusetts Formula, which is a method that utilizes a combination of gross revenues, total assets and direct
labor costs for the allocation base. The results of Exelon s corporate operations are presented as  Other  within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.   
        Exelon owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries,
either directly or indirectly, except for ComEd, of which Exelon owns more than 99%, and BGE, of which Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of BGE s preference stock. Exelon owned none of PECO s preferred securities, which PECO
redeemed in 2013. Exelon has reflected the third-party interests in ComEd, which totaled less than $1 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, as equity, PECO s preferred securities as preferred securities of subsidiary
through their redemption in 2013, and BGE s preference stock as BGE preference stock not subject to mandatory redemption in its consolidated financial statements. BGE is subject to some ring-fencing measures established by order of the
MDPSC. As part of this arrangement, BGE common stock is held directly by RF Holdco LLC, which is an indirect subsidiary of Exelon. GSS Holdings (BGE Utility), an unrelated party, holds a nominal non-economic interest in RF Holdco LLC with
limited voting rights on specified matters.            Generation owns
100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for certain Exelon Wind projects, of which Generation holds a majority interest ranging from 94% to 99% for certain periods of time, and the remaining
interests are included in non-controlling interest on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 for further discussion of Exelon s and Generation s VIEs and the reversionary interests of the
non-controlling members for certain of these projects.         
  ComEd owns 100% of all of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for RITELine Illinois, LLC, of which
ComEd owns 75% and an additional 12.5% is indirectly owned by Exelon. Exelon and ComEd have reflected the third-party interests of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, in RITELine Illinois, LLC, which both totaled less than $1 million at December 31,
2013 and December 31, 2012, as equity.            Exelon
consolidates the accounts of entities in which Exelon has a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. A controlling financial interest is evidenced by either a voting interest greater than 50% in which
Exelon can exercise control over the operations and policies of the investee, or the results of a model that identifies Exelon or one of its subsidiaries as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Where Exelon does not have a controlling financial
interest in an entity, it applies proportional consolidation, equity method accounting or cost method accounting. Exelon applies proportionate consolidation when it has an undivided interest in an asset and is proportionately liable for its share of
each liability associated with the asset. Exelon proportionately consolidates its undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities, as well as its undivided ownership interests in upstream natural gas
exploration and production activities. Under proportionate consolidation, Exelon separately records its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. Exelon applies equity
method accounting when it has significant influence over an investee through an ownership in common stock, which generally approximates a 20% to 50% voting interest. Exelon applies equity method accounting
  
         217   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
to certain investments and joint ventures, including the 50.01% interest in CENG, and certain financing trusts of ComEd, PECO, and BGE. Under the equity method, Exelon reports its interest in the
entity as an investment and Exelon s percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in its financial statements. Exelon uses the cost method if it holds less than 20% of the common stock of an entity. Under the cost
method, Exelon reports its investment at cost and recognizes income only to the extent Exelon receives dividends or distributions.         
  For the year ended December 31, 2013, BGE recorded a $2 million (pre-tax) correcting adjustment to decrease amortization expense related to
regulatory assets that were originally recorded during 2012, an adjustment to decrease income tax expense by $4 million related to the recognition and measurement of regulatory assets that should have been recorded in periods prior to 2013, and a $4
million (pre-tax) correcting adjustment to decrease operating and maintenance expense for an overstatement of BGE s life insurance obligation related to post-employment benefits in prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2012, BGE
recorded a $2 million (pre-tax) correcting adjustment to reduce electric distribution revenue related to decoupling of 2011 electric distribution revenue, a $3 million (pre-tax) correcting adjustment to increase electric operations and maintenance
expense related to capitalization of electric transmission costs, and a $5 million (pre-tax) correcting adjustment to interest expense to reflect the impacts of amendments of tax positions previously taken on prior-year consolidated income tax
returns. In addition, ComEd identified a disclosure adjustment within the renewable energy credits and alternative energy credits section of the 2012 Form 10-K Note 8 Intangible Assets which has been revised in Note 10 of this year s
report. Exelon, ComEd and BGE have concluded these correcting adjustments are not material to its results of operations, cash flows, or financial positions for the years ended December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, or any prior period.
           The accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.   
         Use of Estimates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and other postretirement benefits, the application of purchase accounting, inventory reserves, allowance for uncollectible accounts, goodwill and asset impairments, derivative
instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
         Reclassifications (Exelon, ComEd, and BGE)    
        Certain prior year amounts in Exelon s and BGE s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows, and Exelon s, ComEd s, and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets have been reclassified between line items for comparative purposes and correction of prior period classification errors
identified in 2013. The reclassifications did not affect any of the Registrants  net income or cash flows from operating activities.         
  In 2013, Exelon and BGE corrected the presentation of interest expense related to BGE s financing trust of $12 million and $16 million,
respectively, to be presented as Interest expense to   
         218   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
affiliates, net on their Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. BGE also reclassified the related Accrued expenses of $4 million to Payables to
affiliates on its December 31, 2012 Balance Sheet. Similar adjustments are also reflected in Note 22   Related Party Transactions. Exelon and Generation also corrected amounts disclosed within Note 22   Related Party Transactions to
increase Purchased power and fuel from affiliates by $114 million and to increase Payables to affiliates by $20 million. In 2013, Generation corrected the presentation of interest expense related to certain debt of $75 million to be presented as
Interest expense to affiliates, net on its Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2012 and within Note 22   Related Party Transactions.             Accounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which
requires ComEd, PECO and BGE to record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: 1) rates are established or approved by a
third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities  cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates are set at levels that will recover the entities  costs from
customers. Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE account for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, the PAPUC, and the MDPSC, in the cases of
ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively, under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent
with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. Exelon believes that it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. However, Exelon, ComEd, PECO and
BGE continue to evaluate their respective abilities to apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, including consideration of current events in their respective regulatory and political environments. If a
separable portion of ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of
regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their results of operations and financial positions. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.            The Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance
of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.   
         Revenues (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues are recorded as
service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers. ComEd records its best estimates of the distribution
and transmission revenue impacts resulting from changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE records its best estimate of the transmission revenue impact
resulting from changes in rates that BGE believes are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanism. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 6 Accounts Receivable for further information.   
          RTOs and ISOs.   In RTO and ISO markets that facilitate the
dispatch of energy and energy-related products, the Registrants generally report sales and purchases conducted on a net hourly basis in   
         219   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
either revenues or purchased power on their Consolidated Statements of Operations, the classification of which depends on the net hourly activity. In addition, capacity revenue and expense
classification is based on the net sale or purchase position of the Company in the different RTOs and ISOs.         
    Option Contracts, Swaps and Commodity Derivatives.   Certain option contracts and swap arrangements that meet the definition of
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction. For example, gas transactions may be used
to hedge the sale of power. This will result in the change in fair value recorded through revenue. As of the merger date, Exelon and Generation have currently elected to de-designate all of their commodity cash flow hedge positions. As ComEd
receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, ComEd records the fair value of its energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for further information.         
    Proprietary Trading Activities.   Exelon and Generation account for Generation s trading activities under the provisions of the
authoritative guidance for accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities, which require energy revenues and costs related to energy trading contracts to be presented on a net basis in the income statement.
Commodity derivatives used for trading purposes are accounted for using the mark-to-market method with unrealized gains and losses recognized in operating revenues. Refer to Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for further information.
            Income Taxes (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Deferred Federal and state income taxes are provided on all
significant temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and are
recognized in book income over the life of the related property. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a
more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that
the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.
The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense or in other income and deductions (interest income) on their Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
        Pursuant to the IRC and relevant state taxing authorities, Exelon and
its subsidiaries file consolidated or combined income tax returns for Federal and certain state jurisdictions where allowed or required. See Note 14 Income Taxes for further information.             Taxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE collect certain taxes from
customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges, and fees that are levied by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of gas and electricity. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but
paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes   
         220   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes
are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. See Note
23 Supplemental Financial Information for Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s utility taxes that are presented on a gross basis.         
   Cash and Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   
         Restricted Cash and Investments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Restricted cash and investments represent funds that
are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Exelon Corporate s restricted cash and investments primarily represented restricted funds for payment of medical, dental, vision and long-term
disability benefits. Additionally, Exelon Corporate has funds restricted for merger commitments. In addition, Exelon Corporate s investments include its direct financing lease investments. As of December 31, 2013, Generation s
restricted cash and investments primarily included cash at Antelope Valley required for debt service and construction and cash at Continental Wind required for debt service and financing of operation and maintenance of the underlying entities. As of
December 31, 2012, Generation s restricted cash primarily included cash at Antelope Valley required for debt service and construction. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, ComEd s restricted cash primarily represented cash
collateral held from suppliers associated with ComEd s REC procurement contracts. As of December 31, 2013, PECO s restricted cash primarily represented funds from the sales of assets that were subject to PECO s mortgage
indenture. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, BGE s restricted cash primarily represented funds restricted at its consolidated variable interest entity for repayment of rate stabilization bonds.   
        Restricted cash and investments not available to satisfy current
liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Exelon s and Generation s NDT funds, which are designated to satisfy future decommissioning obligations, were classified as noncurrent assets. As of
December 31, 2013, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE had investments in Rabbi trusts classified as noncurrent assets.         
   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the
Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging, historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd and PECO estimate the
allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit
quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of
accounts receivable in each risk segment. BGE estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by assigning reserve factors for each aging bucket. These percentages were derived from a study of billing progression
which determined the reserve factors by aging bucket. ComEd, PECO and BGE customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed   
         221   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. ComEd, PECO and BGE customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory
requirements. ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC regulations, respectively. See
Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of uncollectible accounts receivable at ComEd.         
   Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon accounts for its investments in and arrangements with VIEs
based on the authoritative guidance which includes the following specific requirements:         

requires an entity to qualitatively assess whether it should consolidate a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most
significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,      

requires an ongoing reconsideration of this assessment instead of only upon certain triggering events, and      

requires the entity that consolidates a VIE (the primary beneficiary) to present separately on the face of its balance sheet (1) the assets of the
consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (2) the liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.
              Based on the above accounting guidance,
Exelon has adopted the following policies related to variable interest entities:         

Exelon has presented separately on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, to the extent material, the assets of its consolidated VIEs that can only be used to settle
specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and the liabilities of Exelon s consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to Exelon s general credit.      

Exelon has qualitatively assessed whether the equity holders of the entity have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the entity.
              See Note 2 Variable Interest
Entities for additional information.             Inventories (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Inventory is recorded at the
lower of weighted average cost or market. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory.         
    Fossil Fuel.   Fossil fuel inventory includes the weighted average costs of stored natural gas, propane and oil. The costs of natural
gas, propane, coal and oil are generally included in inventory when purchased and charged to fuel expense when used or sold.         
    Materials and Supplies.   Materials and supplies inventory generally includes the weighted average costs of transmission, distribution
and generating plant materials. Materials are generally charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.   
         222   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Emission Allowances.   Emission allowances are included in inventory (for emission
allowances exercisable in the current year) and other deferred debits (for emission allowances that are exercisable beyond one year) and are carried at the lower of weighted average cost or market and charged to fuel expense as they are used in
operations.             Marketable Securities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)             All marketable securities are reported at fair
value. Marketable securities held in the NDT funds, certain Generation Rabbi trust investments and BGE s Rabbi trust investments are classified as trading securities and all other securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the former ComEd and former PECO nuclear generating units (Regulatory Agreement Units) are included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd and
PECO and in noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in noncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the former AmerGen
nuclear generating units, the Zion generating station and portions of the Peach Bottom nuclear generating units not subject to a regulatory agreement (Non-Regulatory Agreement Units) are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on certain Generation Rabbi trust investments and BGE s Rabbi trust investments are included in earnings at Exelon, Generation and BGE. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, for Generation s,
ComEd s and PECO s available-for-sale securities are reported in OCI. Any decline in the fair value of ComEd s and PECO s available-for-sale securities below the cost basis is reviewed to determine if such decline is
other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the available-for-sale securities is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in earnings. See
Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations for information regarding marketable securities held by NDT funds and Note 23 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets and
liabilities.             Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             Property, plant and equipment is
recorded at original cost. Original cost includes labor, materials and construction overhead. When appropriate, original cost also includes capitalized interest for Generation and Exelon Corporate and AFUDC for regulated property at ComEd, PECO and
BGE. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to maintenance expense as incurred. For constructed assets, Exelon capitalizes construction-related direct labor
and material costs. ComEd, PECO and BGE also capitalized indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities.            Third parties reimburse ComEd, PECO and BGE for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such
contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, Plant and Equipment. DOE SGIG funds reimbursed to PECO and BGE are accounted for as CIAC.   
        For Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is charged to
accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly-installed
asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

   For ComEd, PECO and BGE, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to
accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. ComEd s and BGE s depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with
each utility s regulatory recovery method. ComEd s and BGE s actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability. PECO s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and
recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO s regulatory recovery method.        
  Generation s oil and gas exploration and production activities consist of working interests in gas producing fields. Generation accounts for
these activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Acquisition, development and exploration costs are capitalized. Costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized and later charged to expense if reserves are not
discovered or deemed not to be commercially viable. Other exploratory costs are charged to expense when incurred.         
  See Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 9 Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 23 Supplemental Financial Information
for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment.         
   Nuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)          
  The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method. The
estimated disposal cost of SNF is established per the Standard Waste Contract with the DOE and is expensed through fuel expense at one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation. On-site SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a
DOE (or government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the SNF disposal fee.             Nuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)    
        Costs associated with nuclear outages, including planned major
maintenance activities, are expensed to operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment (based on the nature of the activities) in the period incurred.             New Site Development Costs (Exelon and Generation)    
        New site development costs represent the costs incurred in the
assessment and design of new power generating facilities. Such costs are capitalized when management considers project completion to be probable, primarily based on management s determination that the project is economically and operationally
feasible, management and/or the Exelon board of directors has approved the project and has committed to a plan to develop it, and Exelon and Generation have received the required regulatory approvals or management believes the receipt of required
regulatory approvals is probable. Capitalized development costs are charged to Operating and maintenance expense when project completion is no longer probable. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no material capitalized development
costs for projects not yet under construction included in Property, plant and equipment, net on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Approximately $10 million, $4 million and $2 million of costs were
expensed by Exelon and Generation for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These costs primarily related to the possible development of new renewable energy projects.

    Capitalized Software Costs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Costs incurred during the application development stage of software
projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain
other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements. The following table presents net unamortized capitalized software costs and amortization of
capitalized software costs by year:         

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Except for the amortization of nuclear fuel,
depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis using the composite method. ComEd s and BGE s depreciation includes a provision for estimated removal costs as
authorized by the respective regulators. The estimated service lives for ComEd, PECO and BGE are primarily based on the average service lives from the most recent depreciation study for each respective company. The estimated service lives of the
nuclear-fuel generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year license renewal extension of the operating licenses (to the extent that such renewal has not yet been granted) for all of
Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. The estimated service lives of the hydroelectric generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension
of the operating licenses. The estimated service lives of the fossil fuel and other renewable generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which Generation periodically evaluates based on feasibility assessments
taking into account economic and capital requirement considerations.            See Note 7 Property, Plant and Equipment for further information regarding depreciation.         
  Depletion of oil and gas exploration and production activities is recorded using the units-of-production method over the remaining life of the
estimated proved reserves at the field level for acquisition costs and over the remaining life of proved developed reserves at the field level for development costs. The estimates for gas reserves are based on internal calculations.   
        Amortization of regulatory assets is recorded over the recovery period
specified in the related legislation or regulatory agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost would have originally been recorded
  
         225   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. With exception of income tax-related regulatory assets, when the recovery period is more than one
year, the amortization is recorded to Depreciation and amortization in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For income tax related regulatory assets, amortization is generally recorded to Income
tax expense in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.         
  See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 23 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding Generation s
nuclear fuel, Generation s ARC and the amortization of ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s regulatory assets.         
   Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The authoritative guidance for accounting for AROs requires the
recognition of a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even though the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear
generating stations, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost
studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Generation generally updates its ARO annually during the third quarter, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost
studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years. The
liabilities associated with Exelon s non-nuclear AROs are adjusted on an ongoing rotational basis, at least once every five years. Changes to the recorded value of an ARO result from the passage of new laws and regulations, revisions to either
the timing or amount of estimates of undiscounted cash flows, and estimates of cost escalation factors. AROs are accreted each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to operating and maintenance
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations or, in the case of the majority of ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s accretion, through an increase to regulatory assets. See Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional
information.             Capitalized Interest and AFUDC (Exelon, Generation, ComEd,
PECO and BGE)             During construction, Exelon and
Generation capitalize the costs of debt funds used to finance non-regulated construction projects. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to interest expense.   
        Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE apply the authoritative guidance for
accounting for certain types of regulation to calculate AFUDC, which is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded to construction work in
progress and as a non-cash credit to AFUDC that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

   The following table summarizes total incurred interest, capitalized interest and credits to AFUDC
by year:         

(b)  
  Includes interest expense to affiliates.           
   Guarantees (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken in issuing
the guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur.         
  The liability that is initially recognized at the inception of the guarantee is reduced as the Registrants are released from risk under the
guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the
guarantee. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.             Asset Impairments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
    Long-Lived Assets.   The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of their long-lived assets or asset groups, excluding goodwill, when
circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing their undiscounted expected future cash flows to their carrying value. Cash
flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Cash flows from Generation plant assets are generally
evaluated at a regional portfolio level along with cash flows generated from Generation s supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from contracts that are recorded as intangible contract assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet. In certain cases generation assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generation assets (typically contracted renewables).
           Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset
or asset group exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or   
         227   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value.
           Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the
expected future cash flows and the fair value of the long-lived assets and asset groups include, among other factors, a deteriorating business climate, including energy prices and market conditions, revisions to regulatory laws, or plans to dispose
of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.         
    Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 10 Intangible Assets for additional information regarding Exelon s and ComEd s goodwill.         
    Equity Method Investments.   Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they
are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is not temporary in nature. Additionally, if the project in which Generation holds an investment recognizes an impairment loss, Exelon and Generation
would record their proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other than temporary decline in value.         
    Direct Financing Lease Investments.   Direct financing lease investments represent the estimated residual values of leased coal-fired
plants in Georgia and Texas. Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments and records an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values
below their carrying values. See Note 8 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for additional information.             Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including the normal purchases
and normal sales exception. Additionally, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge)
or hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying
hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the cost or value of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and
later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivative contracts intended to serve as economic hedges and that are
not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales exception, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in revenue,
purchased power and fuel, interest expense or other, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. For energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, which
are subject to Exelon s Risk Management Policy, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. All amounts classified in earnings related to proprietary trading are
  
         228   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
included in revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing cash
flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction.            For commodity derivative contracts, effective with the date of the merger with Constellation, Generation no longer utilizes the election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its
existing cash flow hedges prior to the merger. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remain probable, the fair value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated OCI and will be reclassified to results of
operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. None of Constellation s designated cash flow hedges for commodity transactions prior to the merger were re-designated as cash
flow hedges. The effect of this decision is that all derivatives executed to hedge economic risk for commodities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings for the combined company.   
        As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation
enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and
ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity. Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a
reasonable period of time and will not be financially settled. Revenues and expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed.
While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional
information.             Retirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)             Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and
other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE and BSC employees. Effective March 12, 2012, Exelon became the sponsor of all of Constellation s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans and defined contribution savings plans.            The
measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the
plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Gains or losses
in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 16 Retirement Benefits for additional
discussion of Exelon s accounting for retirement benefits.             Equity
Investment Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Affiliates (Exelon and Generation)             Exelon and Generation include equity in earnings from equity method investments in qualifying facilities, power projects and joint ventures, including Generation s 50.01% interest in CENG, in equity in
earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates also includes any adjustments to amortize the difference, if any, except for goodwill and land, between
  
         229

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
their cost in an equity method investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment. See Note 5 Investment in CENG and Note 25 Related Party
Transactions for additional discussion of Exelon s and Generation s investment in CENG.            Exelon and Generation continuously monitor for issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these equity method investments and which could result in the recognition of an impairment loss if such
investment experiences an other than temporary decline in value.             New
Accounting Pronouncements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Exelon has identified the following new accounting pronouncements that have been recently adopted or issued that may affect the Registrants.   
          Presentation of Items Reclassified out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income              In February 2013, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance requiring entities to present either in the notes or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, reclassifications from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the affected income
statement line items. Entities only need to disclose the affected income statement line item for components reclassified to net income in their entirety; otherwise, a cross-reference to the related note should be provided. This guidance was
effective for the Registrants for periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and was required to be applied prospectively. As this guidance provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Registrants 
results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. See Note 21 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the new disclosures.         
    Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities     
        In December 2011 (and amended in January 2013), the FASB issued
authoritative guidance requiring entities to disclose both gross and net information about recognized derivative instruments, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing or
lending transactions that are offset on the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset on the balance sheet. The guidance was effective for the Registrants for
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and was required to be applied retrospectively. This guidance is primarily applicable to certain derivative transactions for Exelon and Generation. As this guidance provides only disclosure
requirements, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial positions. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for the new disclosures.   
          Inclusion of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate as a Benchmark
Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes              In
July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance permitting entities to designate the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Prior to the issuance of this guidance, only interest rates on
direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government and the LIBOR swap rate were considered benchmark interest rates in the U.S. This guidance was effective immediately and can be applied prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging
relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013. Currently, the Registrants do not use the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate as a benchmark interest rate, but may in the future.   
         230   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following recently issued accounting standard is not yet required to be reflected in the
combined financial statements of the Registrants.         
    Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits When Net Operating Loss Carryforwards, Similar Tax Losses or Tax Credit Carryforwards Exist
             In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative
guidance requiring entities to present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to deferred tax assets for losses or other tax carryforwards that would be available to offset the uncertain tax positions at the reporting date. Currently, the
Registrants present their unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities on a gross basis unless an unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in the recognition of a net operating loss or other
tax carryforward for that year. This guidance is effective for the Registrants for periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and is required to be applied prospectively, with retroactive application permitted. The Registrants will not
retroactively adopt this guidance. This guidance is currently not expected to have an impact on the Registrants upon adoption with the exception of Exelon and Generation in which approximately $11 million of unrecognized tax benefits will be offset
against current deferred income assets. The adoption of this standard will not impact the Registrants  results of operations.         
     2. Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             Under the applicable authoritative guidance, a VIE is a legal entity that possesses any of the following characteristics:
an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity
owners who do not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary, which is the enterprise that has
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance.         
  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Exelon, Generation, and BGE consolidated four and five VIEs or VIE groups, respectively, for which the
applicable Registrant was the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2013, the Registrants had one VIE for which the Registrants were the primary beneficiary, however, the VIE is immaterial and was not included in the consolidated financial
statements or in the consolidated VIE table below. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Registrants had significant interests in eight and nine other VIEs for which the Registrants do not have the power to direct the entities  activities,
respectively, and accordingly, were not the primary beneficiary.   
         231   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Consolidated Variable Interest Entities              The carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs  assets and liabilities included in the
Registrants  consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:         

(a)  
  Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments not pushed down to the BGE standalone entity.     

(b)  
  Includes total assets of $146 million and total liabilities of $42 million as of December 31, 2012 related to a retail supply company that is not a consolidated VIE as of
December 31, 2013. See additional information below.              Except as specifically noted below, the assets in the table above are restricted for settlement of the VIE obligations and the liabilities in the preceding table can only be settled using VIE resources.   
          RSB BondCo LLC   .  In 2007, BGE formed RSB BondCo LLC
(BondCo), a special purpose bankruptcy remote limited liability company, to acquire and hold rate stabilization property and to issue and service bonds secured by the rate stabilization property. In June 2007, BondCo purchased rate stabilization
property from BGE, including the right to assess, collect, and receive non-bypassable rate stabilization charges payable by all residential electric customers of BGE. These charges are being assessed in order to recover previously incurred power
purchase costs that BGE deferred pursuant to Senate Bill 1. BGE has determined that BondCo is a VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary. As a result, BGE consolidates BondCo.   
        BondCo s assets are restricted and can only be used to settle the
obligations of BondCo. Further, BGE is required to remit all payments it receives from customers for rate stabilization charges to BondCo. During 2013, 2012, and 2011, BGE remitted $83 million, $85 million, and $92 million, respectively, to BondCo.
           BGE did not provide any additional financial support to
BondCo during 2013. Further, BGE does not have any contractual commitments or obligations to provide additional financial support to BondCo unless additional rate stabilization bonds are issued. The BondCo creditors do not have any recourse to the
general credit of BGE in the event the rate stabilization charges are not sufficient to cover the bond principal and interest payments of BondCo.         
    Retail Gas Group   .  During 2009, Constellation formed two new entities, which now are part of Generation, and combined them with
its existing retail gas activities into a retail gas entity group for the purpose of entering into a collateralized gas supply agreement with a third-party gas supplier. While Generation owns 100% of these entities, it has been determined that the
retail gas entity group is a VIE because there is not sufficient equity to fund the group s activities without the additional credit support that is provided in the form of a parental guarantee. Generation is the primary beneficiary of the
retail gas entity group; accordingly, Generation consolidates the retail gas entity group as a VIE.   
         232   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The third-party gas supply arrangement is collateralized as follows:   

The assets of the retail gas entity group must be used to settle obligations under the third-party gas supply agreement before it can make any distributions to
Generation,            

The third-party gas supplier has a collateral interest in all of the assets and equity of the retail gas entity group, and      

As of December 31, 2013 Exelon provided a $75 million parental guarantee to the third-party gas supplier in support of the retail gas entity group.
              Other than credit support provided by the
parental guarantee, Exelon or Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support under the collateralized third-party gas supply agreement. The third-party gas supply creditors do not have any
recourse to Exelon s or Generation s general credit other than the parental guarantee.              Solar Project Entity Group.   In 2011, Constellation formed a group of solar project limited liability companies to build, own, and operate solar power facilities, which are now part of Generation.
Additionally, on September 30, 2011, Generation acquired all of the equity interests in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (Antelope Valley) from First Solar, Inc., a 230-MW solar PV project under construction in northern Los Angeles County,
California. While Generation owns 100% of these entities, it has been determined that certain of the individual solar project entities are VIEs because the entities require additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental
guarantee of debt, loans from the customers in order to obtain the necessary funds for construction of the solar facilities, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements.
Generation is the primary beneficiary of the solar project entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the solar power facilities. Generation provides capital funding to these solar VIE
entities for ongoing construction of the solar power facilities. In addition, these solar VIE entities have an aggregate amount of outstanding debt with third parties of $536 million, as of December 31, 2013, for which the creditors have no
recourse to Generation, however there is limited recourse to Generation with respect to remaining equity contributions necessary to complete the Antelope Valley project. For additional information on these project-specific financing arrangements
refer to Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements.         
    Retail Power Supply Entity.   In August 2013, Generation executed an agreement to terminate its energy supply contract with a retail
power supply company that was previously a consolidated VIE. Generation did not have an ownership interest in the entity, but was the primary beneficiary through the energy supply contract. As a result of the termination, Generation no longer has a
variable interest in the retail power supply company and ceased consolidation of the entity during the third quarter of 2013. Upon deconsolidation, there was no gain or loss recognized. The assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interest were
removed from Exelon s and Generation s balance sheet and the change in non-controlling interest is also reflected on the Statement of Changes in Shareholders  Equity and the Statement of Changes in Member s Equity for Exelon and
Generation, respectively.              Wind Project Entity
Group.   Generation owns and operates a number of wind project limited liability entities, the majority of which were acquired on December 9, 2010 when Generation completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of John Deere
Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind). Generation has evaluated the significant agreements and ownership structures and risks of each of its wind projects and underlying entities, and determined that certain of the entities are VIEs because
either the projects have non-controlling interest holders that absorb variability from the wind projects, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the
primary beneficiary of the wind project entities that

qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the wind power facilities. While Generation owns 100% of the majority of the wind project entities, 10
of the projects have non-controlling equity interests held by third parties, that currently range between 1% and 6%. Of these 10 projects, Generation s current economic interests in nine of the projects are significantly greater than its stated
contractual governance rights and all of these projects have reversionary interest provisions that provide the non-controlling interest holder with a purchase option, certain of which are considered bargain purchase prices, which, if exercised,
transfers ownership of the projects to the non-controlling interest holder upon either the passage of time or the achievement of targeted financial returns. The ownership agreements with the non-controlling interests state that Generation is to
provide financial support to the projects in proportion to its current economic interests in the projects that currently range between 94% and 99%. However, no additional support to these projects beyond what was contractually required has been
provided during 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are consolidated as a result of Generation being the primary beneficiary of the wind VIE entities primarily relate to the wind generating
assets, PPA intangible assets and working capital amounts.         
  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, ComEd and PECO did not have any consolidated VIEs.              Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities     
        Exelon s and Generation s variable interests in
unconsolidated VIEs generally include three transaction types: (1) equity investments, (2) energy purchase and sale contracts, and (3) fuel purchase commitments. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is
reflected on their Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments in affiliates. For the energy purchase and sale contracts and the fuel purchase commitments (commercial agreements), the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with the VIEs are predominately related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by, or owed to, Exelon and Generation for the deliveries
associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements. Further, Exelon and Generation have not provided material debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements or performance guarantees associated with these commercial
agreements.            As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Exelon
and Generation had significant unconsolidated variable interests in eight and nine, respectively, VIEs for which they were not the primary beneficiary; including certain equity investments and certain commercial agreements. The change in the number
of unconsolidated variable interests is driven by the completion of certain obligations which cause the entities to no longer be unconsolidated variable interests offset by the addition of an equity investment in a residential solar provider. The
following tables present summary information about the significant unconsolidated VIE entities:

(a)  
  These items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not on Exelon s or Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These items are included to provide
information regarding the relative size of the unconsolidated VIEs.     

(b)  
  These items represent amounts on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the asset sale agreement with ZionSolutions, LLC. The net assets
pledged for Zion Station decommissioning includes gross pledged assets of $458 million and $614 million as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively; offset by payables to ZionSolutions LLC of $414 million and $564 million
as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. These items are included to provide information regarding the relative size of the ZionSolutions LLC unconsolidated VIE. See Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations for further
discussion.              For each unconsolidated VIE,
Exelon and Generation assess the risk of a loss equal to their maximum exposure to be remote and, accordingly Exelon and Generation have not recognized a liability associated with any portion of the maximum exposure to loss. In addition, there are
no agreements with, or commitments by, third parties that would materially affect the fair value or risk of their variable interests in these variable interest entities.   
          Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.   In March 2005,
Constellation, to which Generation is now a successor, closed a transaction in which Generation assumed from a counterparty two power sales contracts with previously existing VIEs. The VIEs previously were created by the counterparty to issue debt
in order to monetize the value of the original contracts to purchase and sell power. Under the power sales contracts, Generation sold power to the VIEs which, in turn, sold that power to an electric distribution utility through 2013. In connection
with this transaction, a third-party acquired the equity of the VIEs and Generation loaned that party a portion of the purchase price. If the electric distribution utility were to default under its obligation to buy power from the VIEs, the equity
holder could transfer its equity interests to Generation in lieu of repaying the loan. In this event, Generation would have the right to seek recovery of its losses from the electric distribution utility. As a result, Generation has concluded that
consolidation was not required. During 2013, the third-party repaid their obligations of the loan with Generation which caused the entities to no longer be unconsolidated VIEs.   
          ZionSolutions.   Generation has an asset sale agreement
with EnergySolutions, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions), which is further discussed in Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this agreement, ZionSolutions can put the assets and liabilities
back to Generation when decommissioning is complete. Generation has evaluated this agreement and determined that, through the put option, it has a variable interest in ZionSolutions but is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, Generation has
concluded that consolidation is not required. Other than the asset sale agreement, Exelon or Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support and ZionSolutions  creditors do not have any
recourse to Exelon s or Generation s general credit.   
         235   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Fuel Purchase Commitments.   Generation s customer supply operations include the
physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generating capacity, and long-, intermediate- and short-term contracts. Generation also has contracts to purchase fuel supplies for nuclear and fossil generation. These contracts and
Generation s membership in NEIL are discussed in further detail in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies. Generation has evaluated these contracts and its membership with NEIL and determined that it either has no variable interest in an
entity or, where Generation does have a variable interest in an entity, the variable interest is not significant and it is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, consolidation is not required.   
        For contracts where Generation has a variable interest, the level of
variability being absorbed through the contracts is not considered significant because of the small proportion of the entities  activities encompassed by the contracts with Generation. Further, Generation has considered which interest holder
has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and thus is considered the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the entity. The primary beneficiary must also have exposure to
significant losses or the right to receive significant benefits from the VIE. In general, the most significant activity of the VIEs is the operation and maintenance of the facilities. Facilities represent power plants, sources of uranium and fossil
fuels, or plants used in the uranium conversion, enrichment and fabrication process. Generation does not have control over the operation and maintenance of the facilities considered VIEs, and it does not bear operational risk of the facilities.
Furthermore, Generation has no debt or equity investments in the entities and Generation does not provide any other financial support through liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments other than purchase commitments described in Note
22 Commitments and Contingencies. Upon consideration of these factors, Generation does not consider itself to have significant variable interests in these entities or be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, accordingly, has determined
that consolidation is not required.              Investment in
Energy Development Projects.   Generation has several equity investments in energy generating facilities. Generation has evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structures and risks of each of its equity investments, and determined
that certain of the entities are VIEs because Generation guarantees the debt of the entity, provides equity support, or provides operating services to the entity. Generation has reviewed the entities and has determined that Generation is not the
primary beneficiary of the entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance.  
          Residential Solar Provider.   Generation has an equity
investment in a residential solar provider. Generation has evaluated the significant agreements, ownership structure and risks of the entity, and determined that the entity is a VIE because it does not have sufficient equity at risk to fund its
operations. Generation has determined that its equity investment in the entity is a variable interest. However, Generation has concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary because Generation does not have the power to direct the activities of
the VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. Exelon or Generation do not have any contractual or other obligations to provide additional financial support and the residential solar provider s creditors do not
have any recourse to Exelon s or Generation s general credit.              ComEd, PECO and BGE              ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s retail operations frequently include the purchase of electricity and RECs through procurement contracts of varying durations. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note
22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on these contracts. ComEd, PECO   
         236

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
and BGE have evaluated these types of contracts and have historically determined that either there is no significant variable interest in the entity, or where either ComEd, PECO or BGE does have
a significant variable interest in a VIE, ComEd, PECO or BGE would not be the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidation would not be required.         
  For contracts where ComEd, PECO or BGE is considered to have a significant variable interest, consideration is given to which interest holder has
the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE. In general, the most significant activity of the VIEs is the operation and maintenance of their production or procurement processes related to
electricity, RECs, AECs or natural gas. ComEd, PECO and BGE do not have control over the operation and maintenance of the entities and they do not bear operational risk related to the associated activities. Generally, the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities in ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with VIEs as a result of commercial arrangements represent the amounts owed by the utilities for the purchases associated with
the current billing cycles under the contracts. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of accounts payable owed by the utilities under agreements with these VIEs was not material. In addition, variability from these contracts is mitigated by
the fact that the utilities are able to recover costs incurred under purchase agreements through customer rates. Furthermore, ComEd, PECO and BGE do not have any debt or equity investments in these VIEs and do not provide any other financial support
through liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments other than purchase commitments described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies. Accordingly, none of ComEd, PECO or BGE considers itself to be the primary beneficiary of any
VIEs as a result of commercial arrangements.            The financing
trust of ComEd, ComEd Financing III, the financing trusts of PECO, PECO Trust III and PECO Trust IV, and the financing trust of BGE, BGE Capital Trust II are not consolidated in Exelon s, ComEd s, PECO s or BGE s financial
statements. These financing trusts were created to issue mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. ComEd, PECO, and BGE have concluded that they do not have a significant variable interest in ComEd Financing III, PECO Trust III, PECO Trust
IV or BGE Capital Trust II as each Registrant financed its equity interest in the financing trusts through the issuance of subordinated debt and, therefore, has no equity at risk. See Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional
information.               3. Regulatory Matters
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             The
following matters below discuss the current status of material regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.         
   Illinois Regulatory Matters          
    Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act (Exelon and ComEd).          
         Background             Since 2011, ComEd s distribution rates are established through a performance-based rate formula, pursuant to EIMA.
EIMA also provides a structure for substantial capital investment by utilities over a ten-year period to modernize Illinois  electric utility infrastructure. Participating utilities are required to file an annual update to the performance-based
formula rate tariff on or before May 1, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. This annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions. The update also
reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year. Throughout each year, ComEd records regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and
  
         237   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
corresponding increases or decreases to operating revenues for any differences between the revenue requirement(s) in effect and ComEd s best estimate of the revenue requirement expected to
be approved by the ICC for that year s reconciliation. As of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, ComEd had a net regulatory asset associated with the distribution formula rate of $463 million and $209 million, respectively.
            Formula Rate Tariff    
        On November 8, 2011, ComEd filed its initial formula rate tariff
and associated testimony based on 2010 costs and 2011 plant additions. The primary purpose of that proceeding was to establish the formula rate under which rates will be calculated going-forward, and the initial rates, which went into effect in late
June 2012. On May 29, 2012, the ICC issued an Order (May Order) in that proceeding. The May Order reduced the annual revenue requirement by $168 million, or approximately $110 million more than the proposed reduction by ComEd. Of this
incremental revenue requirement reduction, approximately $50 million reflected the ICC s determination that certain costs should be recovered through alternative rate recovery tariffs available to ComEd or will be reflected in a subsequent
annual reconciliation, thereby primarily delaying the timing of cash flows. The incremental revenue reduction also reflected a $35 million reduction for the disallowance of return on ComEd s pension asset, a $10 million reduction for incentive
compensation related adjustments, and $15 million of reductions for various adjustments for cash working capital, operating reserves, and other technical items. In the second quarter of 2012, ComEd recorded a decrease in revenue of approximately
$100 million pre-tax to decrease the regulatory asset for 2011 and for the first three months of 2012 consistent with the terms of the May Order.         
  On June 22, 2012, the ICC granted an expedited rehearing on three of the issues decided in the May Order. On October 3, 2012, the ICC
issued its final order (Rehearing Order) in that rehearing, adopting ComEd s position on the return on its pension asset, resulting in an increase in the annual revenue requirement. For the two other issues, the ICC ruled against ComEd by
reaffirming use of an average rather than year-end rate base in the annual reconciliation and amending its prior order to provide a short-term debt rate to apply to the annual reconciliation. In the fourth quarter of 2012, ComEd recorded an increase
in revenue of approximately $135 million pre-tax consistent with the terms of the Rehearing Order, of which $75 million pre-tax reflects the reinstatement of the return on pension asset for 2011 and $60 million pre-tax reflects the return on pension
asset for 2012. New rates reflecting the impacts of the Rehearing Order went into effect in November 2012. ComEd has filed an appeal with the Illinois Appellate Court. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals.   
        In March 2013, the Illinois legislature passed Senate Bill 9 to clarify
the intent of EIMA on the three issues decided in the Rehearing Order: an allowed return on ComEd s pension asset; the use of year-end rather than average rate base and capital structure in the annual reconciliation; and the use of ComEd s
weighted average cost of capital interest rate rather than a short-term debt rate to apply to the annual reconciliation. On May 22, 2013, Senate Bill 9 became effective after the Illinois legislature overrode the Governor s veto of that
Bill. On June 5, 2013, the ICC approved ComEd s updated distribution formula rate structure to reflect the impacts of Senate Bill 9.         
  In October 2013, the ICC opened an investigation (the Investigation), in response to a complaint filed by the Illinois Attorney General, to change
the formula rate structure by requesting three changes: the elimination of the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate interest on the annual reconciliation balance, the netting of associated accumulated
deferred income taxes against the annual reconciliation balance in calculating interest, and the use of average rather than year-end rate base for determining any ROE collar adjustment. On November 26, 2013, the ICC
  
         238   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
issued its final order in the Investigation, rejecting two of the proposed changes but accepting the proposed change to eliminate the income tax gross-up on the weighted average cost of capital
used to calculate interest on the annual reconciliation balance. The accepted change became effective in January 2014, and is estimated to reduce ComEd s 2014 revenue by approximately $8 million. This change had no financial statement impact on
ComEd in 2013. ComEd and intervenors requested rehearing, however all rehearing requests were denied by the ICC. ComEd and intervenors have filed appeals with the Illinois Appellate Court. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals.
            Annual Reconciliation    
         2012 Filing.  On April 30, 2012, ComEd filed its annual
distribution formula rate. On December 20, 2012, the ICC, issued its final order, which increased the revenue requirement by $73 million, in conformity with the formula rate structure provided in the May 2012 and Rehearing Orders. The $73
million reflected an increase of $80 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2012 and a decrease of $7 million for the annual reconciliation for 2011. The rate increase was set using an allowed return on capital of 7.54% (inclusive of an
allowed return on common equity of 9.81%). The rates took effect in January 2013. ComEd and intervenors requested a rehearing on specific issues, which was denied by the ICC. ComEd and intervenors also filed appeals with the Illinois Appellate
Court. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals.         
  On May 30, 2013, ComEd updated its revenue requirement allowed in the December 2012 Order to reflect the impacts of Senate Bill 9, which
resulted in a reduction to the current revenue requirement in effect of $14 million. The rates took effect in July 2013.         
   2013 Filing.  On April 29, 2013, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate, which was updated in August 2013, to request a total
increase to the revenue requirement of $353 million of which approximately $42 million related to Senate Bill 9. On December 19, 2013, the ICC issued its final order which increased the revenue requirement by $341 million, reflecting an increase of
$160 million for the initial revenue requirement for 2013 and an increase of $181 million for the annual reconciliation for 2012. The rate increase was set using an allowed return on capital of 6.94% (inclusive of an allowed return on common equity
of 8.72%). The rates took effect in January 2014. ComEd requested a rehearing on specific issues, which was denied by the ICC. ComEd also filed an appeal. ComEd cannot predict the results of any such appeals.   
         Expenditures and Capital Investment    
        As part of the enactment of EIMA legislation ComEd made an initial
contribution of $15 million (recognized as expense in 2011) to a new Science and Technology Innovation Trust fund on July 31, 2012, and will make recurring annual contributions of $4 million, the first of which was made on December 31,
2012, which will be used for customer education for as long as the AMI Deployment Plan remains in effect. In addition, ComEd will contribute $10 million per year for five years, as long as ComEd is subject to EIMA, to fund customer assistance
programs for low-income customers, which will not be recoverable through rates. These contributions began in 2012.         
  On January 6, 2012, ComEd filed its Infrastructure Investment Plan with the ICC. Under that plan, ComEd will invest approximately $2.6 billion
over ten years to modernize and storm-harden its distribution system and to implement smart grid technology. On April 23, 2012, ComEd filed its initial AMI Deployment Plan with the ICC, which was approved by the ICC on June 22, 2012, with
certain modifications. ComEd outlined the new deployment schedule within testimony provided in the AMI Plan Rehearing and filed a revised AMI deployment plan. The deployment plan provides for the installation of 4 million electric smart meters,
of which more than 60,000 meters were installed by the end of 2013.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Appeal of 2007 Illinois Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and ComEd).   The ICC
issued an order in ComEd s 2007 electric distribution rate case (2007 Rate Case) approving a $274 million increase in ComEd s annual delivery services revenue requirement, which became effective in September 2008. In the order, the ICC
authorized a 10.3% rate of return on common equity. ComEd and several other parties filed appeals of the rate order with the Illinois Appellate Court (Court). The Court issued a decision on September 30, 2010, ruling against ComEd on the
treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation and the recovery of system modernization costs via a rider (Rider SMP).         
  The court held the ICC abused its discretion in not reducing ComEd s rate base to account for an additional 18 months of accumulated
depreciation while including post-test year pro forma plant additions through that period. ComEd continued to bill rates as established under the ICC s order in the 2007 Rate Case until June 1, 2011 when the rates set in the 2010 electric
distribution rate case (2010 Rate Case) became effective. In subsequent ICC proceedings, the ICC issued an order requiring ComEd to provide a refund of approximately $37 million to customers related to the treatment of post-test year accumulated
depreciation issue. On March 26, 2012, ComEd filed a notice of appeal with the Court.            However, on September 27, 2013 the Court ruled against ComEd on the accumulated depreciation issue and affirmed that ComEd owes a refund to customers of $37 million. As of December 31, 2013, and
December 31, 2012, ComEd was fully reserved for this liability. ComEd will not seek rehearing or appeal on this matter and is working with the ICC on the process and timing for a refund to customers.   
          Advanced Metering Program Proceeding (Exelon and ComEd)
  ComEd s 2007 Rate Case filing included a system modernization rider, which permitted investments in AMI to study the costs and benefits and to develop the cost estimate of full system-wide implementation. In October 2009, the ICC
approved a modified version of ComEd s system modernization rider proposed in the 2007 Rate Case, Rider AMP (Advanced Metering Program). ComEd collected approximately $24 million under Rider AMP through December 31, 2013. Several other
parties, including the Illinois Attorney General, appealed the ICC s order on Rider AMP. In ComEd s 2010 electric distribution rate case, the ICC approved ComEd s transfer of other costs from recovery under Rider AMP to recovery
through electric distribution rates. On March 19, 2012, the Court reversed the ICC s approval of Rider AMP, concluding that the ICC s October 2009 approval of the rider constituted single-issue ratemaking. ComEd filed a Petition for
Leave to Appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court on April 23, 2012, which was denied in September 2012, and the matter was returned to the ICC to calculate a refund amount. ComEd believes any refund obligation associated with Rider AMP should be
prospective from no earlier than the date of the Appellate Court s order on March 19, 2012. As a result, ComEd recorded a regulatory liability of approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2013, which represents the amounts collected
from customers since March 19, 2012. ComEd cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the ICC proceeding and therefore, actual refunds may differ from the estimated accrual recorded at December 31, 2013.   
          2010 Illinois Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and
ComEd).   On May 24, 2011, the ICC issued an order in ComEd s 2010 Rate Case, which became effective on June 1, 2011. The order approved a $143 million increase to ComEd s annual delivery services revenue requirement and a
10.5% rate of return on common equity. ComEd originally requested a $396 million increase, although it was subsequently reduced to $343 million to account for various adjustments. As expected, the ICC followed the Court s ruling on ComEd s
2007 Rate Case on the post-test year accumulated depreciation issue. The order allowed ComEd to establish or reestablish a net amount of approximately   
         240   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
$40 million of previously expensed plant balances or new regulatory assets, which is reflected as a reduction in operating and maintenance expense and income tax expense in 2011. The order also
affirmed the current regulatory asset for severance costs, which was challenged by an intervener in the 2010 Rate Case. The order was appealed to the Court by several parties on a number of issues. On May 16, 2013, the Court dismissed as moot
the appeals of the ICC s order in the 2010 Rate Case as ComEd now recovers distribution costs under EIMA through a pre-established formula rate tariff.         
    Utility Consolidated Billing and Purchase of Receivables (Exelon and ComEd).   Since the first quarter of 2011, ComEd has been required
to buy certain RES receivables, primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers, at the option of the RES, for electric supply service and then include those amounts on ComEd s bill to customers. Receivables are purchased at
a discount to compensate ComEd for uncollectible accounts. ComEd produces consolidated bills for the aforementioned retail customers reflecting charges for electric delivery service and purchased receivables. As of December 31, 2013, the
balance of purchased accounts receivable was $105 million. Under the applicable tariff, ComEd recovers from RES and customers the costs for implementing and operating the program. A number of municipalities, including the City of Chicago have
switched to RES electric supply. As a result, ComEd experienced a significant increase in the amount of RES receivables it purchased in 2013.         
    Illinois Procurement Proceedings (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).   ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs
from retail customers without mark-up. Since June 2009, as a result of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, the IPA designs, and the ICC approves, an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and the IPA administers a competitive process under which
ComEd procures its electricity supply from various suppliers, including Generation. On December 21, 2011, the ICC approved the IPA s procurement plan covering the period June 2012 through May 2017.   
        The Illinois Settlement Legislation requires ComEd to purchase an
increasing percentage of the electricity it purchases for customer deliveries from renewable energy resources. Purchases by customers of electricity from competitive generation suppliers, whether as a result of the customers  own actions or as
a result of municipal aggregation, are not included in this calculation and have the effect of reducing ComEd s purchase obligation. ComEd entered into several 20-year contracts with unaffiliated suppliers in December 2010 regarding the
procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs in order to meet its obligations under the state s RPS. Under the Illinois Settlement Legislation, all associated costs are recoverable from customers.   
        As a result of reduced ComEd load forecasts, purchases under the
existing long-term contracts for energy and the associated RECs were reduced on a pro-rata basis under the terms of those contracts for the June 2013 May 2014 period to keep the purchases under the statutory rate impact cap. The
curtailment s impact on ComEd s financial position and cash flows was immaterial.            On December 18, 2013, the ICC approved the IPA s 2014-2019 procurement plan. The plan provides for two separate energy procurements during 2014 to address potential fluctuations in energy demand due to
customer switching between ComEd and competitive electric generation suppliers. The Commission also approved the IPA s expansion of energy efficiency programs for both ComEd and Ameren. The ICC did not require the acquisition of additional
renewable resources in 2014-2015 due to insufficient available funds to procure those resources. Further, the ICC again approved a reduction of purchases under the existing long-term contracts for energy and the associated RECs on a pro-rata basis
under the terms of those contracts for the June 2014 May 2015 period to keep the purchases under the statutory rate impact cap; however the amount of the reduction will not be finalized and approved by the ICC until March 2014. The
curtailment s impact on ComEd s financial position and   
         241

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
cash flows is expected to be immaterial. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding ComEd s financial swap contract with Generation, which expired
in May 2013, and long-term renewable energy contracts.         
  During 2013, the ICC approved, and directed ComEd and Ameren (the Utilities) to enter into 20-year sourcing agreements with FutureGen Industrial
Alliance, Inc (FutureGen), under which FutureGen will retrofit and repower an existing plant in Morgan County, Illinois to a 166 MW near zero emissions coal-fueled generation plant, with an assumed commercial operation date in 2017. The sourcing
agreement provides that the Utilities will pay FutureGen s contract prices, which are set annually pursuant to a formula rate. The contract prices are based on the difference between the costs of the facility and the revenues FutureGen receives
from selling capacity and energy from the unit into the MISO or other markets, as well as any other revenue FutureGen receives from the operation of the facility. The order also directs the Utilities to recover (or pass along) these costs from the
Utilities  distribution system customers, regardless of whether they purchase electricity from the utility or from competitive electric generation suppliers. In February 2013, ComEd filed an appeal with the Illinois Appellate Court questioning
the legality of requiring ComEd to procure power for retail customers purchasing electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers.         
  On August 22, 2013, the Utilities executed the sourcing agreement with FutureGen in accordance with the ICC order. However, in the event the
order is reversed as a result of the appeal, ComEd s obligations under the sourcing agreement should be suspended. Depending on the ultimate outcome of the appeals, the eventual market conditions and the cost of the facility, the sourcing
agreement could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and ComEd s cash flows and financial positions.

          Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources (Exelon and
ComEd).   As a result of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, electric utilities in Illinois are required to include cost-effective energy efficiency resources in their plans to meet an incremental annual program energy savings requirement of
0.2% of energy delivered to retail customers for the year ended June 1, 2009, which increases annually to 2.0% of energy delivered in the year commencing June 1, 2015 and each year thereafter. Additionally, during the ten-year period that
began June 1, 2008, electric utilities must implement cost-effective demand response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers. The energy efficiency and demand response goals are subject to rate
impact caps each year. Utilities are allowed recovery of costs for energy efficiency and demand response programs, subject to approval by the ICC. In December 2010, the ICC approved ComEd s second three-year Energy Efficiency and Demand
Response Plan covering the period June 2011 through May 2014. The plans are designed to meet the Illinois Settlement Legislation s energy efficiency and demand response goals through May 2014, including reductions in delivered energy to all
retail customers and in the peak demand of eligible retail customers.            EIMA provides for additional energy efficiency in Illinois. Starting in the June 2013 May 2014 period and occurring annually thereafter, as part of the IPA procurement plan, ComEd is to include
cost-effective expansion of current energy efficiency programs, and additional new cost-effective program and/or third-party energy efficiency programs that are identified through a request for proposal process. All cost-effective energy
efficiency programs are included in the IPA procurement plan for consideration of implementation. While these programs are monitored separately from the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS), funds for both the EEPS portfolio and IPA
energy efficiency programs are collected under the same rider.

   Since June 1, 2008, utilities have been required to procure cost-effective renewable energy
resources in amounts that equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. ComEd is also required to acquire amounts of renewable energy resources that will cumulatively increase this
percentage to at least 10% by June 1, 2015, with an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth in the Illinois Settlement Legislation. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd had
purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply with the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd currently retires all RECs upon transfer and acceptance. ComEd is permitted to recover procurement costs of RECs
from retail customers without mark-up through rates. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for information regarding ComEd s future commitments for the procurement of RECs.             Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters          
    2010 Pennsylvania Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate Cases (Exelon and PECO).   On December 16, 2010, the PAPUC approved
the settlement of PECO s electric and natural gas distribution rate cases, which were filed in March 2010, providing increases in annual service revenue of $225 million and $20 million, respectively. The electric settlement provides for
recovery of PJM transmission service costs on a full and current basis through a rider. The approved electric and natural gas distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2011.            In addition, the settlements included a stipulation regarding how tax benefits related to the application of any new IRS
guidance on repairs deduction methodology are to be handled from a rate-making perspective. The settlements require that the expected cash benefit from the application of any new guidance to tax years prior to 2011 be refunded to customers over a
seven-year period. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011-43 providing a safe harbor method of tax accounting for electric transmission and distribution property. PECO adopted the safe harbor and elected a method change for
the 2010 tax year. The expected total refund to customers for the tax cash benefit from the application of the safe harbor to costs incurred prior to 2010 is $171 million. On October 4, 2011, PECO filed a supplement to its electric distribution
tariff to execute the refund to customers of the tax cash benefit related to the IRC Section 481(a)  catch-up  adjustment claimed on the 2010 income tax return, which is subject to adjustment based on the outcome of IRS examinations.
Credits have been reflected in customer bills since January 1, 2012.            In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. The expected total refund to customers for the tax cash benefit from
the application of the new method to costs incurred prior to 2011 is $54 million. This amount is subject to adjustment based on the outcome of IRS examinations. Credits have been reflected in customer bills since January 1, 2013. PECO currently
anticipates that the IRS will issue guidance in early 2014 providing a safe harbor method of accounting for gas transmission and distribution property.         
  The prospective tax benefits claimed as a result of the new methodology will be reflected in tax expense in the year in which they are claimed on
the tax return and will be reflected in the determination of revenue requirements in the next electric and natural gas distribution rate cases. See Note 14 for additional information.            The 2010 electric and natural gas distribution rate case settlements did not specify the rate of return upon which the
settlement rates are based, but rather provided for an increase in annual revenue. PECO has not filed a transmission rate case since rates have been unbundled.

     Pennsylvania Procurement Proceedings (Exelon and PECO).   PECO s first PAPUC
approved DSP Program, under which PECO was providing default electric service, had a 29-month term that ended May 31, 2013. On October 12, 2012, the PAPUC issued its Opinion and Order approving PECO s second DSP Program, which was
filed with the PAPUC in January 2012. The program, which has a 24-month term from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2015, complies with electric generation procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. Under the DSP Programs, PECO is permitted
to recover its electric procurement costs from retail default service customers without mark-up through the GSA. The GSA provides for the recovery of energy, capacity, ancillary costs and administrative costs and is subject to adjustments at least
quarterly for any over or under collections. In addition, PECO s second DSP Program provides for the recovery of AEPS compliance costs through the GSA rather than a separate AEPS rider.            In the second DSP Program, PECO is procuring electric supply for its default electric customers through five competitive
procurements. The load for the residential and small and medium commercial classes is served through competitively procured fixed price, full requirements contracts of two years or less. For the large commercial and industrial class load, PECO has
competitively procured contracts for full requirements default electric generation with the price for energy in each contract set to be the hourly price of the spot market during the term of delivery. In December 2012 and February 2013, PECO entered
into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, for its residential and small and medium commercial classes that began in June 2013. In September 2013, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation,
for its residential and small and medium commercial classes that began in December 2013. In January 2014, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders, including Generation, for its residential and small, medium, and large commercial
classes that will begin in June 2014. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in purchased power from affiliates on PECO s Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
        In addition, the second DSP Program includes a number of retail market
enhancements recommended by the PAPUC in its previously issued Retail Markets Intermediate Work Plan Order. PECO was also directed to allow its low-income Customer Assistance Program (CAP) customers to purchase their generation supply from electric
generation suppliers beginning April 1, 2014. On May 1, 2013, PECO filed a Petition for Approval of its CAP Shopping Plan with the PAPUC, which the PAPUC granted and denied in part on January 9, 2014. PECO and other parties to the proceeding
filed petitions for reconsideration of the Commission s decision on February 10, 2014, and these petitions are currently pending before the PAPUC.         
    Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and PECO).   Pursuant to Act 129 and the follow-on Implementation Order of 2009, in April
2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan (SMPIP), under which PECO will install more than 1.6 million smart meters and an AMI communication network by 2020. The first phase of PECO s SMPIP, which
was completed on June 19, 2013, included the installation of an AMI communications network and the deployment of 600,000 smart meters to communicate with that network. On May 31, 2013, PECO and interested parties filed a Joint Petition for
Settlement of the universal deployment plan with the PAPUC which was approved without modification on August 15, 2013. The Joint Petition for Settlement supports all material aspects of PECO s universal deployment plan, including cost
recovery, excluding certain amounts discussed below. Universal deployment is the second phase of PECO s SMPIP, under which PECO will deploy the remainder of the 1.6 million smart meters on an accelerated basis by the end of 2014. In total,
PECO currently expects to spend up to $595 million, excluding the cost of the original meters (as further described below), on its smart meter infrastructure and approximately   
         244

$120 million on smart grid investments through 2014 of which $200 million will be funded by SGIG as discussed below. As of December 31, 2013, PECO has spent $423 million and $116
million on smart meter and smart grid infrastructure, respectively, not including the DOE reimbursements received to date.         
  Pursuant to the ARRA of 2009, PECO and the DOE entered into a Financial Assistance Agreement to extend PECO $200 million in non-taxable SGIG funds
of which $140 million relates to smart meter deployment and $60 million relates to smart grid infrastructure. As part of the agreement, the DOE has a conditional ownership interest in qualifying Federally-funded project property and equipment, which
is subordinate to PECO s existing mortgage. The SGIG funds are being used to offset the total impact to ratepayers of the smart meter deployment required by Act 129. As of December 31, 2013, PECO has received $190 million of the $200
million in reimbursements. PECO s outstanding receivable from the DOE for reimbursable costs was $3 million as of December 31, 2013, which has been recorded in Other accounts receivable, net on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated
Balance Sheets.            On August 15, 2012, PECO suspended
installation of smart meters for new customers based on a limited number of incidents involving overheating meters. Following its own internal investigation and additional scientific analysis and testing by independent experts completed after
September 30, 2012, PECO announced its decision to resume meter deployment work on October 9, 2012. PECO has replaced the previously installed meters with an alternative vendor s meters. PECO is moving forward with the alternative
meters during universal deployment and continues to evaluate meters from several vendors and may use more than one meter vendor during universal deployment.         
  Following PECO s decision, as of October 9, 2012 PECO will no longer use the original smart meters. For the meters that will no longer be
used, the accounting guidance requires that any difference between the carrying value and net realizable value be recognized in the current period s earnings, before considering potential regulatory recovery. The cost of the original meters,
including installation and removal costs, owned by PECO was approximately $17 million, net of approximately $16 million of reimbursements from the DOE and approximately $2 million of depreciation. PECO requested and received approval from the DOE
that the original meters continue to be allowable costs and that any agreement with the vendor will not be considered project income. In addition, PECO remains eligible for the full $200 million in SGIG funds. On August 15, 2013, PECO entered
into an agreement with the original vendor, which was part of the final agreement discussed below, under which PECO transferred the original uninstalled meters to the vendor and will receive $12 million in return, of which $7 million has been
received as of December 31, 2013. On January 23, 2014, PECO entered a final agreement with the vendor pursuant to which PECO will be reimbursed for amounts incurred for the original meters and related installation and removal costs,
via cash payments and rebates on future purchases of licenses, goods and services primarily through 2017. PECO previously had intended to seek regulatory rate recovery in a future filing with the PAPUC of amounts not recovered from the vendor. As
PECO believed such costs were probable of rate recovery based on applicable case law and past precedent on reasonably and prudently incurred costs, a regulatory asset was established at the time of the removals. As of December 31, 2013 and
2012, $5 million and $17 million, respectively, was recorded on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pursuant to the January 23, 2014, vendor agreement, PECO will reclassify the regulatory asset balance as a
receivable, with no gain or loss impacts on future results of operations.              Energy Efficiency Programs (Exelon and PECO).   PECO s PAPUC-approved Phase I EE C Plan had a four-year term that began on June 1, 2009 and concluded on May 31, 2013. The Phase I
plan set forth how PECO would meet the required reduction targets established by Act 129 s EE C provisions,   
         245   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

which included a 3% reduction in electric consumption in PECO s service territory and a 4.5% reduction in PECO s annual system peak demand in the 100 hours of highest demand by
May 31, 2013.            The peak demand period ended on
September 30, 2012 and PECO communicated its compliance with the reduction targets in a preliminary filing with the PAPUC on March 1, 2013. The final compliance report for all Phase I targets, was filed with the PAPUC on November 15,
2013.            On March 29, 2013, PECO filed a Petition with
the PAPUC to change the recovery period of certain Direct Load Control (DLC) Program costs necessary to implement the Phase I Plan. The Petition sought approval to allow PECO to recover $12 million in equipment, installation and information
technology costs for its Residential DLC program with the amounts collected for the Phase I Plan. As the Phase I Plan was implemented at a cost less than originally budgeted, PECO proposed to recover these expenses from its Phase I Energy Efficiency
Program Charge over-collection consistent with PAPUC guidance to recover all Phase I costs through Phase I funding. The PAPUC approved PECO s Petition on May 9, 2013. A regulatory liability was established for the DLC program costs that
will be amortized as a credit to the income statement to offset the related depreciation expense during the same period.         
  The PAPUC issued its Phase II EE C implementation order on August 2, 2012, that provides energy consumption reduction requirements for the
second phase of Act 129 s EE C programs, which went into effect on June 1, 2013. The order tentatively established PECO s three-year cumulative consumption reduction target at 1,125,852 MWh, which was reaffirmed by the PAPUC on
December 5, 2012.            Pursuant to the Phase II
implementation order, PECO filed its three-year EE C Phase II plan with the PAPUC on November 1, 2012. The plan sets forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least 1,125,852 MWh in its service territory for the period
June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016, adjusted for weather and extraordinary loads. The implementation order permits PECO to apply any excess savings achieved during Phase I against its Phase II consumption reduction targets, with no
reduction to its Phase II budget. In accordance with the Act 129 Phase II implementation order, at least 10% and 4.5% of the total consumption reductions must be through programs directed toward PECO s public and low income sectors,
respectively. If PECO fails to achieve the required reductions in consumption, it will be subject to civil penalties of up to $20 million, which would not be recoverable from ratepayers. Act 129 mandates that the total cost of the plan may not
exceed 2% of the electric company s total annual revenue as of December 31, 2006.            On March 15, 2013, PECO filed a Petition for Approval to amend its EE C Phase II Plan to continue its DLC demand reduction program for mass market customers from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014.
PECO proposed to fund the estimated $10 million costs of the one-year program by modifying incentive levels for other Phase II programs. On May 9, 2013, the PAPUC approved PECO s amended EE C Phase II plan. The costs of DLC program
will be recovered through PECO s Energy Efficiency Program Charge along with all other Phase II Plan costs.         
  On November 14, 2013, the PAPUC issued a Tentative Order on Act 129 demand reduction programs which seeks comments on a proposed demand
response program methodology for future Act 129 demand reduction programs as well as demand response potential and wholesale prices suppression studies. The comment process is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. Any decision
reached would affect PECO s EE C Plan subsequent to its Phase II Plan.              Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (Exelon and PECO).   In November 2004, Pennsylvania adopted the AEPS Act. The AEPS Act mandated that beginning in 2011, following the expiration of

PECO s rate cap transition period, certain percentages of electric energy sold to Pennsylvania retail electric customers shall be generated from certain alternative energy resources as
measured in AECs. The requirement for electric energy that must come from Tier I alternative energy resources ranges from approximately 3.5% to 8% and the requirement for Tier II alternative energy resources ranges from 6.2% to 10%. The required
compliance percentages incrementally increase each annual compliance period, which is from June 1 through May 31, until May 31, 2021. These Tier I and Tier II alternative energy resources include acceptable energy sources as set forth
in Act 129 and the AEPS Act.            PECO has entered into
five-year and ten-year agreements with accepted bidders, including Generation, totaling 452,000 non-solar and 8,000 solar Tier I AECs annually in accordance with a PAPUC approved plan. The plan allowed PECO to bank AECs procured prior to 2011 and
use the banked AECs to meet its AEPS Act obligations over two compliance years ending May 2013. The PAPUC also approved the procurement of Tier II AECs and supplemental AECs as well as the sale of excess AECs through independent third-party auctions
or brokers.            All AEPS administrative costs and costs of AECs
incurred after December 31, 2010 are being recovered on a full and current basis from default service customers through a surcharge.         
  PECO s second DSP Program eliminated the AEPS surcharge. Beginning in June 2013, AEPS compliance costs are being recovered through the GSA.
             Investigation of Pennsylvania Retail Electricity
Market (Exelon and PECO).   On July 28, 2011, the PAPUC issued an order outlining the next steps in its investigation into the status of competition in Pennsylvania s retail electric market. The PAPUC found that the existing default
service model presents substantial impediments to the development of a vibrant retail market in Pennsylvania and directed its Office of Competitive Markets Oversight to evaluate potential intermediate and long-term structural changes to the default
service model. On March 1, 2012, the PAPUC issued the final order describing more detailed recommendations to be implemented prior to the expiration of the electric distribution company s current default service plan and providing
guidelines for electric distribution companies for development of their next default service plan. On October 12, 2012, the PAPUC approved PECO s second DSP Program, which includes several new programs to continue PECO s support of
retail market competition in Pennsylvania in accordance with the order issued by the PAPUC on December 15, 2011. Further, the PAPUC issued a final order on February 14, 2013, outlining its proposed end-state for default service, which
included default service pricing for residential and small commercial customers based on three month full requirements contracts, full requirement contracts using hourly spot market pricing for large commercial and industrial default service
customers, and the inclusion of CAP customers in the customer choice programs.              Pennsylvania Act 11 of 2012 (Exelon and PECO).   On February 13, 2012, Act 11 was signed into law by the Governor. Act 11 seeks to clarify the PAPUC s authority to approve alternative
ratemaking mechanisms, which would allow for the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge (DSIC) in rates designed to recover capital project costs incurred to repair, improve or replace utilities  aging electric and natural
gas distribution systems in Pennsylvania. Act 11 also includes a provision that allows utilities to use a fully projected future test year under which the PAPUC may permit the inclusion of projected capital costs in rate base for assets that will be
placed in service during the first year rates are in effect. On August 2, 2012, the PAPUC issued a final order establishing rules and procedures to implement the ratemaking provisions of Act 11. The implementation order requires a utility to
have a Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP) which outlines how the utility is planning to increase its investment for repairing, improving, or replacing

aging infrastructure, approved by the Commission prior to implementing a DSIC. On May 9, 2013, the PAPUC approved PECO s LTIIP for its Gas Operations, which was filed on
February 8, 2013.             Maryland Regulatory Matters    
          2011 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon
and BGE).   In March 2011, the MDPSC issued a comprehensive rate order setting forth the details of the decision contained in its abbreviated electric and gas distribution rate order issued in December 2010. As part of the March 2011
comprehensive rate order, BGE was authorized to defer $19 million of costs as regulatory assets. These costs are being recovered over a 5-year period that began in December 2010 and include the deferral of $16 million of storm costs
incurred in February 2010. The regulatory asset for the storm costs earns a regulated rate of return.         
    2012 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and BGE).   On July 27, 2012, BGE filed an application for increases
to its electric and gas base rates with the MDPSC. On February 22, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order in BGE s 2012 electric and natural gas distribution rate case for increases in annual distribution service revenue of $81 million and $32
million, respectively. The electric distribution rate increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.75% and the gas distribution rate increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.60%. The approved electric and natural gas
distribution rates became effective for services rendered on or after February 23, 2013. As part of the rate order, the MDPSC approved both recovery of and return on merger integration costs incurred during the test year, including
severance. As a result, the order affirmed the treatment of $20 million of severance-related costs that BGE had recorded as a regulatory asset in 2012, consistent with prior MDPSC decisions. Additionally, BGE established a new regulatory asset
of $8 million related to non-severance merger integration costs, which includes $6 million of costs incurred during 2012. Current MDPSC treatment of these merger integration regulatory assets is to provide recovery over a five year period.
             2013 Maryland Electric and Gas Distribution Rate Case
(Exelon and BGE).   On May 17, 2013, BGE filed an application for increases of $101 million and $30 million to its electric and gas base rates, respectively, with the MDPSC. The requested rates of return on equity in the application were
10.50% and 10.35% for electric and gas distribution, respectively. In addition to these requested rate increases, BGE s application includes a request for recovery of incremental capital expenditures and operating costs associated with
BGE s proposed short-term reliability improvement plan in response to a MDPSC order through a surcharge separate from base rates. On August 23, 2013, BGE filed an update to its rate request which altered the requested increase to
electric base rates from $101 million to $83 million and the requested increase to gas base rates from $30 million to $24 million. On December 13, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order in BGE s 2013 electric and natural gas distribution rate
case for increases in annual distribution service revenue of $34 million and $12 million, respectively. The electric distribution rate increase was set using an allowed return on equity of 9.75% and the gas distribution rate increase was set using
an allowed return on equity of 9.60%. The approved electric and natural gas distribution rates became effective for services rendered on or after December 13, 2013. The MDPSC also conditionally approved five of the eight programs included in
BGE s proposed short-term reliability improvement plan. Commencement of the program and recovery are dependent on final MDPSC approval with the surcharge starting no earlier than April 1, 2014.   
          Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and BGE).  
In August 2010, the MDPSC approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE that includes the planned installation of 2 million residential and commercial electric and gas smart meters at an expected total cost of $480 million. The
MDPSC s approval ordered BGE to defer the associated incremental costs, depreciation

and amortization, and an appropriate return, in a regulatory asset until such time as a cost-effective advanced metering system is implemented. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31,
2012, BGE recorded a regulatory asset of $66 million and $31 million, respectively, representing incremental costs, depreciation and amortization, and a debt return on fixed assets related to its AMI program. Additionally, the MDPSC has determined
that the cost recovery for the non-AMI meters that BGE retires will be considered in a future depreciation proceeding. The MDPSC continues to evaluate the impacts of a customer opt-out feature in BGE s Smart Grid program. In March 2013, BGE
filed a description of the overall additional costs associated with allowing customers to retain their current meter, and for radio frequency (RF)-Free and RF-Minimizing options related to the installation of their smart meters as well as a proposed
cost recovery mechanism. The MDPSC held a hearing in August 2013 to consider the filings made by BGE and other Maryland electric utilities. The ultimate resolution related to this feature could affect BGE s ability to demonstrate
cost-effectiveness of the advanced metering system. Overall, BGE continues to believe the recovery of smart grid initiative costs in future rates is probable as BGE expects to be able to demonstrate that the program benefits exceed costs. Pursuant
to the ARRA of 2009, BGE is a recipient of $200 million in federal funding from the DOE for its smart grid and other related initiatives, which substantially reduces the total cost of these initiatives to BGE s ratepayers. The project to
install the smart meters began in late April 2012. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had received $200 million in reimbursements from the DOE.         
    New Electric Generation (Exelon and BGE).   On April 12, 2012, the MDPSC issued an order directing BGE and two other Maryland
utilities to enter into a contract for differences (CfD) with CPV Maryland, LLC (CPV), under which CPV will construct an approximately 700 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation plant in Waldorf, Maryland, that CPV projected will be in
commercial operation by June 1, 2015. The initial term of the proposed contract is 20 years. The CfD mandates that BGE and the other utilities pay (or receive) the difference between CPV s contract prices and the revenues CPV receives for
capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the PJM capacity market. The MDPSC s Order requires the three Maryland utilities to enter into a CfD in amounts proportionate to their relative SOS load.   
        On April 16, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order that required BGE to
execute a specific form of contract with CPV, and the parties executed the contract as of June 6, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, there is no impact on Exelon s and BGE s results of operations, cash flows and financial
positions. Furthermore, the agreement does not become effective until the resolution of certain items, including all current litigation.         
  On April 27, 2012, a civil complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by certain unaffiliated parties that
challenges the actions taken by the MDPSC on Federal law grounds. On October 24, 2013, the U.S. District Court issued a judgment order finding that the MDPSC s Order directing BGE and the two other Maryland utilities to enter into a
CfD, which assures that CPV receives a guaranteed fixed price regardless of the price set by the federally regulated wholesale market, violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. On November 22, 2013, the MDPSC and CPV
appealed the District Court s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.         
  On May 4, 2012, BGE filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland, seeking judicial review of the MDPSC order under
state law. That petition was subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and consolidated with similar appeals that have been filed by other interested parties. On October 1, 2013, the Circuit Court Judge issued a
Memorandum Opinion and Order finding the decisions of the MDPSC were within its statutory authority under   
         249

Maryland law. This decision is separate from the judgment in the federal litigation that the MDPSC Order is unconstitutional and the CfD is unenforceable under federal law. The federal
judgment, if upheld, would prevent enforcement of the CfD even if the Circuit Court decision stands. On October 29, 2013, BGE and the two other Maryland utilities appealed the Circuit Court s ruling to the Maryland Court of Special
Appeals.            Depending on the ultimate outcome of the pending
state and federal litigation, on the eventual market conditions, and on the manner of cost recovery as of the effective date of the agreement, the CfD could have a material impact on Exelon and BGE s results of operations, cash flows and
financial positions.            Exelon believes that this and other
states  projects may have artificially suppressed capacity prices in PJM and may continue to do so in future auctions to the detriment of Exelon s market driven position. In addition to this litigation, Exelon is working with other market
participants to implement market rules that will appropriately limit the market suppressing effect of such state activities.         
    MDPSC Derecho Storm Order (Exelon and BGE).   Following the June 2012 Derecho storm which hit the mid-Atlantic region interrupting
electrical service to a significant portion of the State of Maryland, the MDPSC issued an order on February 27, 2013 requiring BGE and other Maryland utilities to file several comprehensive reports with short-term and long-term plans
to improve reliability and grid resiliency that were due at various times before August 30, 2013.         
  On September 3, 2013, BGE filed a comprehensive long term assessment examining potential alternatives for improving the resiliency of the
electric grid and a staffing analysis reviewing historical staffing levels as well as forecasting staffing levels necessary under various storm scenarios. BGE currently cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, which may result in increased
capital expenditures and operating costs.             The Maryland
Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program (Exelon and BGE).   In February 2013, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation intended to accelerate gas infrastructure replacements in Maryland by establishing a mechanism
for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate proceedings. On May 2, 2013, the Governor of Maryland signed the legislation into law; which took effect
June 1, 2013. Under the new law, following a proceeding before the MDPSC and with the MDPSC s approval of the eligible infrastructure replacement projects along with a corresponding surcharge, BGE could begin charging gas customers a
monthly surcharge for infrastructure costs incurred after June 1, 2013. The legislation includes caps on the monthly surcharges to residential and non-residential customers, and would require an annual true-up of the surcharge revenues against
actual expenditures. Investment levels in excess of the cap would be recoverable in a subsequent gas base rate proceeding at which time all costs for the infrastructure replacement projects would be rolled into gas distribution rates.
Irrespective of the cap, BGE is required to file a gas rate case every five years under this legislation. On August 2, 2013, BGE filed its infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge. The MDPSC held evidentiary hearings on
BGE s proposed plan and surcharge from November 12, 2013 through November 14, 2013. On January 29, 2014, the MDPSC issued a decision conditionally approving the first five years of BGE s plan and surcharge. BGE must submit a
list detailing specific projects planned for 2014 to the MDPSC for approval within 30 days of the decision. Upon approval of the project list by the MDPSC, BGE will be able to implement the surcharge rates on gas customers  bills. The new
surcharges are expected to take effect in second quarter of 2014. In addition, BGE will be subject to an annual independent audit to review plan performance and progress.

    Federal Regulatory Matters    
          Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd and
BGE).   ComEd s and BGE s transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula.         
  ComEd s most recent annual formula rate update filed in April 2013 reflects 2012 actual costs plus forecasted 2013 capital additions. The
update resulted in a revenue requirement of $488 million plus a $25 million adjustment related to the reconciliation of 2012 actual costs for a net revenue requirement of $513 million. This compares to the May 2012 updated revenue requirement of
$450 million offset by a $5 million reduction related to the reconciliation of 2011 actual costs for a net revenue requirement of $445 million. The increase in the revenue requirement was primarily driven by increased capital investment, higher
pension and post-retirement healthcare costs, and higher operating and maintenance costs. The 2013 net revenue requirement became effective June 1, 2013, and is being recovered over the period extending through May 31, 2014. The regulatory
asset associated with the true-up is being amortized as the associated amounts are recovered through rates.         
  ComEd s updated formula transmission rate currently provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate base of 8.70%,
a decrease from the 8.91% return previously authorized. The decrease in return was primarily due to lower interest rates on ComEd s long-term debt outstanding. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd s 2007 transmission rate case,
the rate of return on common equity is 11.5% and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the formula transmission rate is currently capped at 55%.   
        BGE s most recent annual formula rate update filed in April 2013
reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments plus forecasted 2013 capital additions. The update resulted in a revenue requirement of $158 million offset by a $1 million reduction related to the reconciliation of 2012 actual costs for a net
revenue requirement of $157 million. This compares to the April 2012 updated revenue requirement of $156 million increased by $2 million related to the reconciliation of 2011 actual costs for a net revenue requirement of $158 million. The
decrease in the revenue requirement was primarily driven by a lower allowed rate of return associated with a reduced equity ratio and reduced rate base, offset partially by higher depreciation and operating and maintenance costs. The 2013 net
revenue requirement became effective June 1, 2013, and is being recovered over the period extending through May 31, 2014. The regulatory liability associated with the true-up is being amortized as the associated amounts are recovered
through rates.           BGE s updated formula transmission rate
currently provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate base of 8.35%, a decrease from the 8.43% included in the prior year formula update. The decrease in return was primarily due to a debt issuance in 2012 and lower
interest rates on BGE s debt outstanding. As part of the FERC-approved settlement in 2006 of BGE s 2005 transmission rate case, the base rate of return on common equity for BGE s electric transmission business for new transmission
projects placed in service on and after January 1, 2006 is 11.3%, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for participating in PJM.         
    FERC Transmission Complaint (Exelon and BGE).   On February 27, 2013, consumer advocates and regulators from the District of
Columbia, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, and the Delaware Electric Municipal Cooperatives (the parties), filed a complaint at FERC against BGE and the Pepco Holdings, Inc. companies relating to their respective transmission formula rates.
BGE s formula rate includes a 10.8% base rate of return on common equity (ROE) for most investments included in its rate base and 11.3% for the remaining transmission investment (the latter of which is conditioned upon crediting the first 50
basis points of any incentive ROE adders). The parties seek a reduction in the   
         251   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
base return on equity to 8.7% and changes to the formula rate process. FERC docketed the matter and set April 3, 2013 as the deadline for interventions, protests and answers. Under FERC
rules, the earliest date from which the base return on equity could be adjusted and refunds required is the date of the complaint. On March 19, 2013, BGE filed a motion to dismiss or sever the complaint. As of December 31, 2013, BGE cannot
predict the likelihood or a reasonable estimate of the amount of a change, if any, in the allowed base return on equity, or a reasonable estimate of the refund period start date. While BGE cannot predict the outcome of this matter, if FERC orders a
reduction of BGE s base return on equity to 8.7% (while retaining the 50 basis points of any incentives that were credited to the base return on equity for certain new transmission investment), the estimated annual impact would be a reduction
in revenues of approximately $10 million.              PJM
Transmission Rate Design and Operating Agreements (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE).   PJM Transmission Rate Design specifies the rates for transmission service charged to customers within PJM. Currently, ComEd, PECO and BGE incur costs based
on the existing rate design, which charges customers based on the cost of the existing transmission facilities within their load zone and the cost of new transmission facilities based on those who benefit from those facilities. In April 2007, FERC
issued an order concluding that PJM s current rate design for existing facilities is just and reasonable and should not be changed. In the same order, FERC held that the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above should be socialized across the
entire PJM footprint and that the costs of new facilities less than 500 kV should be allocated to the customers of the new facilities who caused the need for those facilities. After FERC ultimately denied all requests for rehearing on all issues,
several parties filed petitions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for review of the decision. On August 6, 2009, that court issued its decision affirming FERC s order with regard to the costs of existing facilities but
reversing and remanding to FERC for further consideration its decision with regard to the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above. On March 30, 2012, FERC issued an order on remand affirming the cost allocation in its April 2007 order. On
March 22, 2013, FERC issued an order denying rehearing of its March 30, 2012 Order and made it clear that the cost allocation at issue concerns only projects approved prior to February 1, 2013. A number of entities have filed appeals
of the FERC orders. ComEd, and BGE anticipate that all impacts of any rate design changes effective after December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, respectively, should be recoverable through retail rates and, thus, the rate design changes are
not expected to have a material impact on their respective results of operations, cash flows or financial position. PECO anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes should be recoverable through the transmission service charge rider
approved in PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement and, thus, the rate design changes are not expected to have a material impact on PECO s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. To the extent that any rate
design changes are retroactive to periods prior to January 1, 2011, however, there may be an impact on PECO s results of operations.         
  On October 11, 2012, the PJM Transmission Owners filed with FERC a cost allocation for new transmission facilities asking that the new cost
allocation methodology apply to all transmission approved by the PJM Board on or after February 1, 2013. The proposed methodology is a hybrid methodology that would socialize 50% of the costs of new facilities at 500kV and above and
double-circuit 345kV lines, and allocate the remaining 50% to direct beneficiaries. For all other facilities, the costs would be allocated to the direct beneficiaries. On March 22, 2013, FERC issued an order accepting the cost allocation with
minor exceptions and requiring a compliance filing on those few issues within 120 days of the order. The compliance filing was made on July 22, 2013.         
  ComEd, PECO and BGE are committed to the construction of transmission facilities under their operating agreements with PJM to maintain system
reliability. ComEd, PECO and BGE will work with

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
PJM to continue to evaluate the scope and timing of any required construction projects. ComEd, PECO and BGE s estimated commitments are as follows:   
     
            PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule
(Exelon and Generation).   PJM s capacity market rules include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) that is intended to preclude sellers from artificially suppressing the competitive price signals for generation capacity. The proceedings
leading to FERC s approval of the MOPR were extensive, and there have been numerous changes to the MOPR and litigation related to it since it was originally implemented. For example, in 2011 the parties disputed numerous elements of the MOPR
including: (i) the default price that should apply to bids found subject to the MOPR, (ii) the duration of the MOPR and (iii) the application of the MOPR to self-supplying capacity and state-sponsored capacity. The FERC orders
approving that MOPR have been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A resolution of that appeal is not expected until sometime in 2014.   
        In May 2012 (based on the MOPR provisions the FERC approved in 2011),
PJM announced the results of its capacity auction covering the delivery year ending May 31, 2016. Several new units with state-sanctioned subsidy contracts cleared in the auction at prices below the MOPR. Potentially, these states could expand
such state-sanctioned subsidy programs or other states may seek to establish similar programs. Generation believed that further revisions to that MOPR were necessary to ensure that the potential to artificially reduce capacity auction prices is
appropriately limited in PJM. In early December 2012, PJM filed a new MOPR for approval at the FERC, which Exelon believed would be more effective in preventing state-sanctioned subsidy contracts from artificially reducing capacity prices.
Generation was actively involved in the process through which those MOPR changes were developed and supported the changes. On May 3, 2013, the FERC issued its order. While the FERC order accepted certain aspects of the proposal that Exelon
supported (such as applying the MOPR to all of PJM and not just certain zones within PJM), the FERC required PJM to retain a key element of its previous MOPR structure, the unit-specific exemption, an element that Exelon had supported removing.
Several entities, including two capacity suppliers that Exelon has been working with sought rehearing of that order.         
  In May 2013 (based on the MOPR provisions the FERC approved earlier that month), PJM announced the results of its capacity auction covering the
delivery year ending May 31, 2017. Exelon is working with PJM stakeholders on several proposed changes to the PJM tariff aimed at ensuring that capacity resources (including those with state-sanctioned subsidy contracts, excessive imported
capacity resources and certain limited availability demand response resources) cannot inappropriately affect capacity auction prices in PJM.         
    Market-Based Rates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).   Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are public utilities for purposes
of the Federal Power Act and are required to obtain FERC s acceptance of rate schedules for wholesale electricity sales. Currently, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have authority to execute wholesale electricity sales at market-based rates. As
is customary with market-based rate schedules, FERC has reserved the right to suspend market-based rate authority on a retroactive basis if it subsequently determines that Generation, ComEd, PECO or BGE has violated the terms and conditions of its
tariff or the Federal Power Act. FERC is also authorized to order refunds in certain instances if it finds that the market-based rates are not just and reasonable under the Federal Power Act.   
         253

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   As required by FERC s regulations, as promulgated in the Order No. 697 series,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE file market power analyses using the prescribed market share screens to demonstrate that Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE qualify for market-based rates in the regions where they are selling energy, capacity, and
ancillary services under market-based rate tariffs. FERC accepted the 2008 filings on September 16, 2008, January 15, 2009 and September 2, 2009 and accepted the 2009 filings on July 28, 2009, October 26,
2009, February 23, 2010 and April 30, 2010, affirming Exelon s affiliates continued right to make sales at market-based rates. These analyses must examine historic test period data and must be updated every three years on a
prescribed schedule. Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE filed an updated analysis for the Northeast Region, which includes PJM, in late 2010, based on 2009 historic test period data. On June 22, 2011, FERC issued an order confirming
Generation s continued authority to charge market based rates, based on Generation s most recent updated analysis filed in 2010, stating that any market power concerns are adequately addressed by PJM s monitoring and mitigation
programs. On December 30, 2013, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE filed its updates analysis for the Northeast Region, based on 2012 historic test period data and FERC has not yet acted on the filing. Similarly, on June 29, 2012, Generation,
ComEd, BGE and PECO filed their updated market power analysis for the Central Region which the FERC accepted on November 13, 2012, and on December 23, 2011, Generation filed its updated market power analysis for the Southeast Region which
the FERC accepted on October 10, 2012. On December 21, 2012, Generation, ComEd, BGE and PECO filed their updated market power analysis for the SPP region, which the FERC accepted on October 8, 2013.   
          Reliability Pricing Model (Exelon, Generation and
BGE).   PJM s RPM Base Residual Auctions take place approximately 36 months ahead of the scheduled delivery year. The most recent auction for the delivery year ending May 31, 2017 occurred in May 2013.   
          License Renewals (Exelon and Generation).   On
June 22, 2011, Generation submitted applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of Limerick Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. The current operating licenses for Limerick Units 1 and 2 expire in 2024 and 2029, respectively. In June 2012,
the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit vacated the NRC s temporary storage rule on the grounds that the NRC should have conducted a more comprehensive environmental review to support the rule. The temporary storage rule (also
referred to as the  waste confidence decision ) recognizes that licensees can safely store spent nuclear fuel at nuclear plants for up to 60 years beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants and that licensing
renewal decisions do not require discussion of the environmental impact of spent fuel stored on site. In August 2012, the NRC placed a hold on issuing new or renewed operating licenses that depend on the temporary storage rule until the court s
decision is addressed. In September 2012, the NRC directed NRC Staff to revise the temporary storage rule which is now not expected until October 3, 2014. Generation does not expect the NRC to issue license renewals until the end of 2014, at
the earliest.            On May 29, 2013, Generation submitted
applications to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of Byron Units 1 and 2 and Braidwood Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. The current operating licenses for Byron Units 1 and 2 expire in 2024 and 2026, respectively. The current operating licenses for
Braidwood Units 1 and 2 expire in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Generation does not expect the NRC to issue license renewals for Byron and Braidwood until 2015 at the earliest.   
        On August 29, 2012 and August 30, 2012, Generation submitted
hydroelectric license applications to the FERC for 46-year licenses for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run), respectively.   
         254

   The FERC extended the deadline to January 31, 2014 to file a water quality certification
application pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) with the MDE for Conowingo. Generation is working with stakeholders to resolve licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish passage and habitat, and
(3) sediment. On January 30, 2014, Exelon filed a water quality certification application pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA with MDE for Conowingo, addressing these and other issues, although Generation cannot currently predict the
conditions that ultimately may be imposed. Resolution of these issues relating to Conowingo may have a material effect on Generation s results of operations and financial position through an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs.
           On August 29, 2013, Exelon filed a water quality
certification application pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA with PA DEP for Muddy Run, addressing these and other issues that included certain commitments made by Generation. The financial impact associated with these commitments is estimated
to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, and will include both an increase in capital expenditures as well as an increase in operating expenses. Exelon anticipates that the PA DEP will issue the water quality certification pursuant to
Section 401 of the CWA for Muddy Run in the first quarter of 2014.            Based on the latest FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process is not expected to be completed prior to the expiration of Muddy Run s current license on August 31, 2014, and the expiration of
Conowingo s license on September 1, 2014. However, the stations would continue to operate under annual licenses until FERC takes action on the 46-year license applications. The stations are currently being depreciated over their useful
lives, which includes the license renewal period. As of December 31, 2013, $33 million of direct costs associated with relicensing efforts have been capitalized.   
         Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE prepare their consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation. Under this guidance, regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers
through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings
in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.

     Pension and other postretirement benefits.   As of December 31, 2013, Exelon had
regulatory assets of $3,015 million and regulatory liabilities of $45 million related to ComEd s and BGE s portion of deferred costs associated with Exelon s pension plans and ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s portion of
deferred costs associated with Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans. PECO s pension regulatory recovery is based on cash contributions and is not included in the regulatory asset (liability) balances. The regulatory asset
(liability) is amortized in proportion to the recognition of prior service costs (gains), transition obligations and actuarial losses (gains) attributable to Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plans determined by the cost
recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits. ComEd, PECO and BGE will recover these costs through base rates as allowed in their most recently approved regulated rate orders. The pension and other
postretirement benefit regulatory asset balance includes a regulatory asset established at the date of the merger related to BGE s portion of the deferred costs associated with legacy Constellation s pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. The BGE-related regulatory asset is being amortized over a period of approximately 12 years, which generally represents the expected average remaining service period of plan participants at the date of the merger. See Note
16 Retirement Benefits for additional detail. No return is earned on Exelon s regulatory asset.         
    Deferred income taxes.   These costs represent the difference between the method by which the regulator allows for the recovery of
income taxes and how income taxes would be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets and liabilities associated with deferred income taxes, recorded in compliance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation and income
taxes, include the deferred tax effects associated principally with accelerated depreciation accounted for in accordance with the ratemaking policies of the ICC, PAPUC and MDPSC, as well as the revenue impacts thereon, and assume continued recovery
of these costs in future transmission and distribution rates. For ComEd and BGE, this amount includes the impacts of a reduction in the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of certain retiree health care costs pursuant to the March 2010
Health Care Reform Acts. ComEd was granted recovery of these additional income taxes on May 24, 2011 in the ICC s 2010 Rate Case order. The recovery period for these costs is through May 31, 2014. For BGE, these additional income
taxes are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order. See Note 14 Income Taxes and Note 16 Retirement Benefits for additional information. ComEd, PECO and BGE are
not earning a return on the regulatory asset in base rates.         
    AMI programs.   For ComEd, this amount represents operating and maintenance expenses and meter costs associated with ComEd s AMI
pilot program approved in the May 24, 2011, ICC order in ComEd s 2010 rate case. The recovery periods for operating and maintenance expenses and meter costs are through May 31, 2014, and January 1, 2020, respectively. As of
December 31, 2013, ComEd had regulatory assets of $35 million related to accelerated depreciation costs resulting from the early retirements of non-AMI meters, which will be amortized over an average ten year period pursuant to the ICC approved
AMI Deployment plan. ComEd is earning a return on the meter costs. For PECO, this amount represents accelerated depreciation and filing and implementation costs relating to the PAPUC-approved Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan as well as
the return on the un-depreciated investment, taxes, and operating and maintenance expenses. The approved plan allows for recovery of filing and implementation costs incurred through December 31, 2012. In addition, the approved plan provides for
recovery of program costs, which includes depreciation on new equipment placed in service, beginning in January 2011 on full and current basis, which includes interest income or expense on the under or over recovery. The approved plan also provides
for recovery of accelerated depreciation on PECO s non-AMI meter assets over a 10-year period ending December 31, 2020. For BGE, this amount represents smart grid pilot program costs as well as the incremental costs associated with
implementing full deployment of a smart grid program. Pursuant to a MDPSC order,

pilot program costs of $11 million were deferred in a regulatory asset, and, beginning with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order, is earning BGE s most current authorized rate of return.
In August 2010, the MDPSC approved a comprehensive smart grid initiative for BGE, authorizing BGE to establish a separate regulatory asset for incremental costs incurred to implement the initiative, including the net depreciation and amortization
costs associated with the meters, and an authorized rate of return on these costs, a portion of which is not recognized under GAAP until cost recovery begins. Additionally, the MDPSC order requires that BGE prove the cost-effectiveness of the entire
smart grid initiative prior to seeking recovery of the costs deferred in these regulatory assets. Therefore, the commencement and timing of the amortization of these deferred costs is currently unknown. BGE s AMI regulatory asset excludes costs
for non-AMI meters being replaced by AMI meters, as the MDPSC has ordered that the cost recovery for non-AMI meters will be considered in a future depreciation proceeding.  
          AMI Meter Events.   This amount represents the remaining
cost value of the original smart meters, net of accumulated depreciation, DOE reimbursements and amounts recovered from the vendor, of smart meter deployment that will no longer be used, including installation and removal costs. PECO intended to
seek through regulatory rate recovery in a future filing with the PAPUC, any amounts no recovered from the vendor. PECO believed the amounts incurred for the original meters and related installation and removal costs were probable of recovery based
on applicable case law and past precedent on reasonably and prudently incurred costs. As such, PECO has deferred these costs on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheet. PECO will not earn a return on the recovery of these costs.
             Under-recovered distribution services costs.  
Under EIMA, which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011, ComEd is allowed recovery of distribution services costs through a formula rate tariff. The legislation provides for an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect
to reflect the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. The over recovery associated with the 2011 reconciliation was recovered through rates over a one-year period, that began in January 2013.
The under recovery associated with the 2012 reconciliation will be recovered through rates over a one-year period beginning in January 2014. ComEd is earning a return on these costs. The regulatory asset also includes costs associated with
certain one-time events, such as large storms, which will be recovered over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2013, the regulatory asset was comprised of $377 million for the annual reconciliation and $86 million related to
significant one-time events. In addition to $58 million in deferred storm costs, net of amortization, the December 31, 2013 balance related to significant one-time events contains $28 million of merger and integration related costs, net of
amortization, incurred as a result of the merger. As of December 31, 2012, the regulatory asset was comprised of $125 million for the annual reconciliation and $84 million related to significant one-time events. In addition to $58 million in
deferred storm costs, net of amortization, the December 31, 2012 balance related to significant one-time events contains $26 million of merger and integration related costs, net of amortization, incurred as a result of the merger. See Note
4 Mergers and Acquisitions for additional information.         
    Debt costs.   Consistent with rate recovery for ratemaking purposes, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s recoverable losses on
reacquired long-term debt related to regulated operations are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the new debt issued to finance the debt redemption or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not
refinanced. Interest-rate swap settlements are deferred and amortized over the period that the related debt is outstanding or the life of the original issuance retired. These debt costs are used in the determination of the weighted cost of capital
applied to rate base in the rate-making process. ComEd and BGE are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs, while PECO is earning a return on the premium of the cost of the reacquired debt through base rates.

     Fair value of BGE long-term debt.   These amounts represent the regulatory asset
recorded at Exelon for the difference in the fair value of the long-term debt of BGE as of the merger date based on the MDPSC practice to allow BGE to recover its debt costs through rates. Exelon is amortizing the regulatory asset and the associated
fair value over the life of the underlying debt.              Fair
value of BGE supply contract.   These amounts represent the regulatory asset recorded at Exelon representing the fair value of BGE s supply contracts as of the close of the merger date based on the MDPSC practice to allow BGE to recover
its supply contracts through rates. Exelon is amortizing the regulatory asset and the associated fair value over a period of approximately three years.         
    Severance.   For ComEd, these costs represent previously incurred severance costs that ComEd was granted recovery of in the
December 20, 2006, ICC rehearing rate order and the May 24, 2011, ICC order in ComEd s 2010 rate case. The recovery periods are through June 30, 2014, and May 31, 2014, respectively. ComEd is not earning a return on these
costs. For BGE, these costs represent deferred severance costs that BGE has previously been granted recovery of in rates. Costs include the portion of costs associated with a 2008 workforce reduction that relate to BGE s gas business which were
deferred in 2009 as a regulatory asset in accordance with the MDPSC s orders in prior rate cases and are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in January 2009. Also included are costs associated with a 2010 workforce reduction that
were deferred as a regulatory asset and are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in March 2011 in accordance with the MDPSC s March 2011 rate order. Finally, costs associated with the 2012 BGE voluntary workforce reduction were
deferred in 2012 as a regulatory asset in accordance with the MDPSC s orders in prior rate cases and are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in July 2012. BGE is earning a regulated return on the regulatory asset included in base
rates.              Asset retirement obligations.   These
costs represent future legally required removal costs associated with existing asset retirement obligations. PECO will begin to earn a return on, and a recovery of, these costs once the removal activities have been performed. ComEd and BGE will
recover these costs through future depreciation rates and will earn a return on these costs once the removal activities have been performed. See Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.   
          MGP remediation costs  . Recovery of these items was
granted to ComEd in the July 26, 2006, ICC rate order. For PECO, these costs are recoverable through rates as affirmed in the 2010 approved natural gas distribution rate case settlement. While BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs,
BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs on a site-specific basis in distribution rates. The period of recovery for both ComEd and PECO will depend on the timing of the actual expenditures. ComEd and PECO are not earning a
return on the recovery of these costs. For BGE, $5 million of clean-up costs incurred during the period from July 2000 through November 2005 and an additional $1 million from December 2005 through November 2010 are recoverable through rates in
accordance with MDPSC orders. These costs are being amortized over 10-year periods that began in January 2006 and December 2010, respectively. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for
additional information.              RTO start-up costs.  
Recovery of these RTO start-up costs was approved by FERC. The recovery period is through March 31, 2015. ComEd is earning a return on these costs.         
    Under (Over)-recovered universal service fund costs.   The universal service fund cost is a recovery mechanism that allows PECO to
recover discounts issued to electric and gas customers

enrolled in assistance programs. As of December 31, 2013, PECO was over-recovered for both its electric and gas programs. PECO earns interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on
over-recovered costs to customers.              Financial swap
with Generation.   To fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ComEd entered into a five-year financial swap contract with Generation that expired on May 31, 2013. Since the swap contract was deemed prudent by the
Illinois Settlement Legislation, ensuring ComEd of full recovery in rates, the changes in fair value each period were recorded by ComEd as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd did not earn (pay) a return on the regulatory asset
(liability). The basis for the mark-to-market derivative asset or liability position was based on the difference between ComEd s cost to purchase energy on the spot market and the contracted price. In Exelon s consolidated financial
statements, the fair value of the intercompany swap recorded by Generation and ComEd was eliminated.         
    Renewable Energy.   On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with
unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. Since the swap contracts were deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ensuring ComEd of full recovery in rates,
the changes in fair value each period as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability are recorded by ComEd. ComEd does not earn (pay) a return on the regulatory asset (liability). The basis for the mark-to-market derivative asset or
liability position is based on the difference between ComEd s cost to purchase energy on the spot market and the contracted price.         
    Energy and transmission programs.   Starting in 2007, ComEd s energy and transmission costs are recoverable (refundable) under
ComEd s ICC and/or FERC-approved rates. ComEd earns interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. The PECO energy costs represent the electric and gas supply related costs recoverable (refundable)
under PECO s GSA and PGC, respectively. PECO earns interest on the under-recovered energy and natural gas costs and pays interest on over-recovered energy and natural gas costs to customers. In addition, beginning in 2013, the deferred DSP I
and II Program costs are presented on a net basis with PECO s GSA under (over)-recovered energy costs. The PECO transmission costs represent the electric transmission costs recoverable (refundable) under the TSC under which PECO earns interest
on under-recovered costs and pays interest on over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2013, PECO had a regulatory liability that included the over-recovered electric transmission costs of $8 million, $34 million related to the DSP
program and $16 million related to over-recovered natural gas supply costs under the PGC. As of December 31, 2012, PECO had a regulatory asset related to under-recovered transmission costs of $1 million and a regulatory liability that included
$47 million related to over-recovered electric supply costs under the GSA and $1 million related to over-recovered natural gas supply costs under the PGC. The BGE energy costs represent the electric and gas supply related costs recoverable
(refundable) from (to) customers under BGE s market-based SOS and MBR programs, respectively. BGE does not earn or pay interest on under- or over-recovered costs to customers. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had a regulatory asset of $1
million related to under-recovered electric supply costs and a regulatory liability of $11 million related to over-recovered natural gas supply costs. As of December 31, 2012, BGE had a regulatory asset of $9 million related to under-recovered
electric supply costs and a regulatory asset of $19 million related to under-recovered natural gas supply costs.         
    DSP Program costs   .  These amounts represent recoverable administrative costs incurred relating to filing, procurement, and
information technology improvements associated with PECO s PAPUC-

approved DSP Program for the procurement of electric supply following the expiration of PECO s generation rate caps on December 31, 2010. The filing and implementation costs of this DSP
Program are recoverable through the GSA over its 29-month term, that began January 1, 2011. The independent evaluator costs associated with conducting procurements is recoverable over a 12-month period after the PAPUC approves the results of
the procurements. Costs relating to information technology improvements are recoverable over a 5-year period that began January 1, 2011. PECO earns a return on the recovery of information technology costs. Beginning in 2013, these costs are
included within the energy and transmission programs line item.              DSP II Program Costs.   These amounts represent recoverable administrative costs incurred relating to the filing and procurement associated with PECO s second PAPUC-approved DSP program for the
procurement of electric supply. The filing and procurement of this DSP Program are recoverable through the GSA over its 24-month term, that began June 1, 2013. The independent evaluator costs associated with conducting procurements are
recoverable over a 12-month period after the PAPUC approves the results of the procurements. PECO is not earning a return on these costs. Beginning in 2013, these costs are included within the energy and transmission programs line item.   
          Deferred storm costs.   In the MDPSC s March 2011 rate
order, BGE was authorized to defer $16 million in storm costs incurred in February 2010. These costs are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in December 2010. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset.   
          Electric generation-related regulatory asset.   As a result
of the deregulation of electric generation, BGE ceased to meet the requirements for accounting for a regulated business for the previous electric generation portion of its business. As a result, BGE wrote-off its entire individual,
generation-related regulatory assets and liabilities and established a single, generation-related regulatory asset to be collected through its regulated rates, which is being amortized on a basis that approximates the pre-existing individual
regulatory asset amortization schedules. The portion of this regulatory asset that does not earn a regulated rate of return were $37 million as of December 31, 2013, and $47 million as of December 31, 2012. BGE will continue to amortize
this amount through 2017.              Rate stabilization
deferral.   In June 2006, Senate Bill 1 was enacted in Maryland and imposed a rate stabilization measure that capped rate increases by BGE for residential electric customers at 15% from July 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007. As a result, BGE
recorded a regulatory asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the difference between the costs to purchase power and the revenues collected from customers, as well as related carrying charges based on short-term interest rates from
July 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007. In addition, as required by Senate Bill 1, the MDPSC approved a plan that allowed residential electric customers the option to further defer the transition to market rates from June 1, 2007, to
January 1, 2008. During 2007, BGE deferred $306 million of electricity purchased for resale expenses and certain applicable carrying charges, which are calculated using the implied interest rates of the rate stabilization bonds, as a regulatory
asset related to the rate stabilization plans. During 2013 and 2012, BGE recovered $66 million and $67 million, respectively, of electricity purchased for resale expenses and carrying charges related to the rate stabilization plan regulatory asset.
BGE began amortizing the regulatory asset associated with the deferral which ended in May 2007 to earnings over a period not to exceed ten years when collection from customers began in June 2007.   
          Energy efficiency and demand response
programs.   These amounts represent costs recoverable (refundable) under ComEd s ICC approved Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan, PECO s PAPUC-approved EE C Plan, and the BGE Smart Energy Savers Program     . ComEd   
         262

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
began recovering these costs or refunding over-collections of these costs on June 1, 2008 through a rider. ComEd earns a return on the capital investment incurred under the program but does
not earn (pay) interest on under (over) collections. For PECO, this amount represents an over-collection of program costs related to both Phase I and Phase II of its EE C Plan. PECO does not earn (pay) interest on under (over) collections. PECO
began recovering the costs of its Phase I and Phase II EE C Plans through a surcharge in January 2010 and June 2013, respectively, based on projected spending under the programs. Phase I recovery continued over the life of the program, which
expired on May 31, 2013 and excess funds collected began being refunded in June 2013. Phase II of the program began on June 1, 2013, and will continue over the life of the program, which will expire on May 31, 2016. Excess funds
collected are required to be refunded beginning in June 2016. PECO earned a return on the capital investment incurred under Phase I of the program. BGE s Smart Energy Savers Program      includes both MDPSC approved demand response and energy efficiency programs. For the BGE Peak Rewards   SM    demand response program which began in January 2008, actual marketing and customer bonus costs incurred in the demand response
program are being recovered over a 5-year amortization period from the date incurred pursuant to an order by the MDPSC. Fixed assets related to the demand response program are recovered over the life of the equipment. Also included in the demand
response program are customer bill credits related to BGE s Smart Energy Rewards program which began in July 2013. Actual costs incurred in the conservation program are being amortized over a 5-year period with recovery beginning in 2010
pursuant to an order by the MDPSC. BGE earns a rate of return on the capital investments and deferred costs incurred under the program and earns (pays) interest on under (over) collections.              Merger integration costs.   These amounts represent integration costs to achieve distribution synergies
related to the merger transaction. As a result of the MDPSC s February 2013 rate order, BGE deferred $8 million related to non-severance merger integration costs incurred during 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Of these costs, $4 million was
authorized to be amortized over a 5-year period that began in March 2013. The recovery of the remaining $4 million was deferred. In the MDPSC s December 2013 rate order, BGE was authorized to recover the remaining $4 million and an additional
$4 million of non-severance merger integration costs incurred during 2013. These costs are being amortized over a 5-year period that began in December 2013. BGE is earning a return on this regulatory asset included in base rates.   
          Under (Over)-recovered electric and gas revenue decoupling.
  These amounts represent the electric and gas distribution costs recoverable from or refundable to customers under BGE s decoupling mechanism, which does not earn a rate of return. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had a regulatory
liability of $7 million related to over-recovered electric revenue decoupling and $9 million related to over-recovered natural gas revenue decoupling. As of December 31, 2012, BGE had a regulatory asset of $5 million related to under-recovered
electric revenue decoupling and a regulatory liability of $7 million related to over-recovered natural gas revenue decoupling.         
    Nuclear decommissioning.   These amounts represent estimated future nuclear decommissioning costs for former ComEd and PECO plants that
exceed (regulatory asset) or are less than (regulatory liability) the associated decommissioning trust fund assets. Exelon believes the trust fund assets, including prospective earnings thereon and any future collections from customers, will be
sufficient to fund the associated future decommissioning costs at the time of decommissioning. See Note 15 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.   
          Removal costs.   These amounts represent funds ComEd and
BGE have received from customers through depreciation rates to cover the future non-legally required cost of removal of property, plant   
         263

and equipment which reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes. This liability is reduced as costs are incurred.   
          DLC Program Costs.   The DLC program costs include
equipment, installation, and information technology costs necessary to implement the DLC Program under PECO s EE C Phase I Plans. PECO received full cost recovery through Phase I collections and will amortize the costs as a credit to the
income statement to offset the related depreciation expense during the same period through September 2025, which is the remaining useful life of the assets. PECO is not paying interest on these over-recovered costs.   
          Electric distribution tax repairs.   PECO s 2010
electric distribution rate case settlement required that the expected cash benefit from the application of Revenue Procedure 2011-43, which was issued on August 19, 2011, to prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period.
Credits began being reflected in customer bills on January 1, 2012. No interest will be paid to customers.         
    Gas distribution tax repairs.   PECO s 2010 natural gas distribution rate case settlement required that the expected cash benefit
from the application of new tax repairs deduction methodologies for 2010 and prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas
distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. Credits began being reflected in customer bills on January 1, 2013. No interest will be paid to customers.         
    Under (Over)-recovered uncollectible accounts.   As a result of the February 2010 ICC order approving recovery of ComEd s
uncollectible accounts, ComEd has the ability to adjust its rates annually to reflect the increases and decreases in annual uncollectible accounts expense starting with year 2008. ComEd recorded a regulatory asset for the cumulative
under-collections in 2008 and 2009. Recovery of the initial regulatory asset was completed over an approximate 14-month time frame which began in April 2010. The recovery or refund of the difference in the uncollectible accounts expense applicable
to the years starting with January 1, 2010, will take place over a 12-month time frame beginning in June of the following year. ComEd is not earning a return or paying interest on these under (over)-recovered costs.   
          Under (Over)-recovered AEPS costs current asset (liability).
  The AEPS costs represent the administrative and AEC costs incurred to comply with the requirements of the AEPS Act, which are recoverable on a full and current basis. PECO earns interest on under-recovered costs and pays interest on
over-recovered costs to customers. Beginning in 2013, these costs are included within the energy and transmission programs line item.         
    Revenue subject to refund.   These amounts represent refunds of $37 million and associated interest of $1 million ComEd owes to
customers primarily related to the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation issue in the 2007 Rate Case. See above discussion of the 2007 Rate Case for further information.        
         Purchase of Receivables Programs (Exelon, ComEd, PECO, and BGE)    
        ComEd, PECO and BGE are required, under separate legislation and
regulations in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively, to purchase certain receivables from retail electric and natural gas suppliers. For retail suppliers participating in the utilities  consolidated billing, ComEd, PECO and BGE
must purchase their customer accounts receivables. ComEd purchases receivables at   
         264   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
a discount to primarily recover uncollectible accounts expense from the suppliers. BGE s tariff provides that receivables are to be purchased at a discount, primarily to recover
uncollectible accounts expense from the suppliers. However, if the discount rate is negative, the tariff provides that the receivable is purchased at a zero discount rate. BGE is currently purchasing certain receivables at a zero discount rate.
PECO is required to purchase receivables at face value and is permitted to recover uncollectible accounts expense from customers through distribution rates. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, and BGE do not record unbilled commodity receivables under their POR
programs. Purchased billed receivables are classified in other accounts receivable, net on Exelon s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables provide information about the purchased receivables
of the Registrants as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.         

(a)  
  PECO s gas POR program became effective on January 1, 2012 and includes a 1% discount on purchased receivables in order to recover the implementation costs of the
program. If the costs are not fully recovered when PECO files its next gas distribution rate case, PECO will propose a mechanism to recover the remaining implementation costs as a distribution charge to low volume transportation customers or apply
future discounts on purchased receivables from natural gas suppliers serving those customers.     

(b)  
  For ComEd and BGE, reflects the incremental allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded, which is in addition to the purchase discount. For ComEd, the incremental uncollectible
accounts expense is recovered through its Purchase of Receivables with Consolidated Billing (PORCB) tariff.           
     4. Merger and Acquisitions          
   Merger with Constellation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
    Description of Transaction           
  On March 12, 2012, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Bolt Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub), and Constellation. As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into Constellation (the Initial Merger) and Constellation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. Following the completion of the Initial
Merger, Exelon and Constellation completed a series of internal corporate organizational restructuring transactions. Constellation merged with and into Exelon, with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation (the Upstream Merger). Simultaneously
with the Upstream Merger, Constellation s interest in RF HoldCo LLC, which holds Constellation s interest in BGE, was transferred to Exelon Energy Delivery Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon that also owns Exelon s
interests in ComEd and PECO. Following the Upstream Merger and the transfer of RF HoldCo LLC, Exelon contributed to Generation certain subsidiaries, including those with generation and customer supply operations that were acquired from Constellation
as a result of the Initial Merger and the Upstream Merger.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Regulatory Matters              In February 2012, the MDPSC issued an Order approving the Exelon and Constellation merger. As part of the MDPSC Order,
Exelon agreed to provide a package of benefits to BGE customers, the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, resulting in an estimated direct investment in the State of Maryland of approximately $1 billion.   
        The following costs were recognized after the closing of the merger and
are included in Exelon s, Generation s and BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2012.   

(a)  
  Exelon made a $66 million equity contribution to BGE in the second quarter of 2012 to fund the after-tax amount of the rate credit as directed in the MDPSC order approving the
merger transaction.              The direct investment
estimate includes $95 million to $120 million relating to the construction of a headquarters building in Baltimore for Generation s competitive energy businesses. On March 20, 2013, Generation signed a 20 year lease agreement that is
contingent upon the developer obtaining all required approvals, permits and financing for the construction of the building. Once required approvals are received and financing conditions are met, construction will commence and the building is
expected to be ready for occupancy in approximately 2 years after building construction commences.            The direct investment estimate also includes $600 million to $650 million for Exelon s and Generation s commitment to develop or assist in development of 285 300 MWs of new generation in Maryland,
expected to be completed over a period of 10 years. The MDPSC Order contemplates various options for complying with the new generation development commitments, including building or acquiring generating assets, making subsidy or compliance payments,
or in circumstances in which the generation build is delayed, making liquidated damages payments. Exelon and Generation expect that the majority of these commitments will be satisfied by building or acquiring generating assets and, therefore, will
be primarily capital in nature and recognized as incurred. If in the future Exelon determines that it is probable that it will make subsidy, compliance or liquidated damages payments related to the new generation development commitments, Exelon will
record a liability at that time. As of December 31, 2013, it is reasonably possible that Exelon will be required to make subsidy or   
         266   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
liquidated damages payments of approximately $40 million rather than build one of the generation projects contemplated by the commitments, given that the generation build is dependent upon the
passage of legislation and other conditions that Exelon does not control.            On July 26, 2013, Generation executed an engineering procurement and construction contract to expand its Perryman, Maryland site with 120MW of new natural gas-fired generation to satisfy certain of these
commitments and achievement of commercial operation is expected in 2015. In December 2013, Generation acquired the Fourmile Ridge Project in western Maryland and executed a wind turbine supply agreement for construction of a 32.5 MW project targeted
for commercial operation in November 2014. This project will satisfy a portion of the 125 MW Tier I land-based renewables commitment. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. As of December 31, 2013, amounts
reflected in the Exelon and Generation consolidated financial statements include $24 million of capital expenditures and $6 million of development costs included within operating and maintenance expense associated with pursuit of these commitments
for new generation in the State of Maryland.            Associated
with certain of the regulatory approvals required for the merger, on November 30, 2012, a subsidiary of Generation sold three Maryland generating stations and associated assets, Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner in Anne Arundel County, Maryland,
and C.P. Crane in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Raven Power Holdings LLC (Raven Power), a subsidiary of Riverstone Holdings LLC. The sale agreement included a base price with purchase price adjustments based on fuel inventory, working capital,
capital expenditures, and timing of the closing, resulting in net proceeds from the sale of approximately $371 million. Decisions by certain market participants to remove themselves from the bidding process, combined with the deadlines and
limitations on the pool of potential buyers imposed by the merger approval orders, resulted in realized sales proceeds below Generation s estimated fair value of the Maryland generating stations. Consequently, Exelon and Generation recorded a
pre-tax loss of $272 million in 2012 to reflect the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the generating stations and associated assets. In the first quarter of 2013, Exelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million
to reflect the final settlement of the sales price with Raven Power.            In connection with the sale of the Maryland generating stations, Exelon agreed to indemnify Raven Power for certain costs associated with the treatment of hazardous substances at off-site disposal facilities and
any claims arising as a result of, or in connection with, any toxic tort, natural resource damages, loss of life or injury to persons due to releases of, or exposure to hazardous substances in connection with Raven Power s remediation of
environmental contamination or Exelon s non-compliance with environmental laws or permits prior to the closing date of the sale.         
  Pursuant to the MDPSC merger approval conditions, BGE is restricted from paying any dividend on its common shares through the end of 2014, was
required to maintain specified minimum capital and O M expenditure levels in 2012 and 2013, and is not permitted to reduce employment levels due to involuntary attrition associated with the merger integration process for two years following the
closing of the merger. Additionally, BGE is subject to other merger approval conditions to enhance BGE s ring-fencing measures established by order of the MDPSC.   
        Subsequent to the merger, Generation discovered that, for the first two
weeks following the merger, due to a software error, Generation inadvertently bid certain generating units into the PJM energy market at prices that slightly exceeded the cost-based caps to which it had agreed. This error was a violation of the
commitments made in connection with merger approvals by DOJ, FERC and the MDPSC. Generation reported the error to the DOJ, FERC and the MDPSC and committed to remedy   
         267   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
the impacts of its error. The MDPSC held a hearing to review the error, and accepted Generation s proposed remediation. Subsequent close examination by Generation of its cost-based bids also
revealed the need for some minor adjustments to the cost build up for certain of its PJM units. Generation has coordinated with PJM to determine the impact on Generation s revenues and the market from this error and these adjustments, and
Generation has worked with PJM to reverse the financial impacts. In November 2012, Generation reached a settlement with the DOJ regarding this matter. The final resolution did not have a material impact on Exelon s or Generation s results
of operations, cash flows or financial position.            Exelon was
named in suits filed in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Maryland alleging that individual directors of Constellation breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the proposed merger transaction and Exelon aided and abetted the individual
directors  breaches. Similar suits were also filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The suits sought to enjoin a Constellation shareholder vote on the proposed merger until all material information was disclosed
and sought rescission of the proposed merger. During the third quarter of 2011, the parties to the suits reached an agreement in principle to settle the suits through additional disclosures to Constellation shareholders. On June 26, 2012, the
court approved the settlement and entered final judgment.                 Accounting for the Merger Transaction              The fair value of Constellation s non-regulated business assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected
future cash flows (including timing); discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future market prices. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and
duration of liabilities assumed.            The financial statements
of BGE do not include fair value adjustments for assets or liabilities subject to rate-setting provisions for BGE. BGE is subject to the rate-setting authority of FERC and the MDPSC and is accounted for pursuant to the accounting guidance for
regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost recovery provisions currently in place for BGE provide revenue derived from costs including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Except for debt, fuel supply
contracts and regulatory assets not earning a return, the fair values of BGE s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions are assumed to approximate their carrying values and, therefore, do not
reflect any net adjustments related to these amounts. For BGE s debt, fuel supply contracts and regulatory assets not earning a return, the difference between fair value and book value of BGE s assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
recorded as a regulatory asset and liability at Exelon Corporate as Exelon did not apply push-down accounting to BGE. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on BGE s push-down accounting treatment. Also
see Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information on BGE s regulatory assets.            The preliminary valuations performed in the first quarter of 2012 were updated in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012, with the most significant adjustments to the preliminary valuation amounts having
been made to the fair values assigned to the acquired power supply and fuel contracts, unregulated property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates. There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the first
quarter of 2013 and the purchase price allocation was final as of March 31, 2013.

   The final purchase price allocation of the Merger of Exelon with Constellation and Exelon s
contribution of certain subsidiaries of Constellation to Generation was as follows:         
            Intangible Assets Recorded     
        For the power supply and fuel contracts acquired from Constellation,
the difference between the contract price and the market price at the date of the merger was recognized as either an intangible asset or liability based on whether the contracts were in or out-of-the-money. The valuation of the acquired intangible
assets and liabilities was estimated by applying either the market approach or the income approach depending on the nature of the underlying contract. The market approach was utilized when prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving comparable transactions were available. Otherwise the income approach, which is based upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the underlying contracts, was utilized. The measure is based upon certain
unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key estimates and inputs include forecasted power and fuel prices and the discount rate. The fair value amounts are amortized over the life of the
contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows as of the merger date. Amortization expense and income are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues.   
        Exelon and Generation present separately in their Consolidated Balance
Sheets the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities for these contracts. Generation s amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to $470 million. Generation s amortization expense for the period
March 12, 2012 to December 31, 2012 amounted to $1,101 million. In addition, Exelon Corporate has established a regulatory asset and an unamortized energy contract liability related to BGE s power supply and fuel contracts. The power
supply and fuel contracts regulatory asset amortization was $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $116 million for the period March 12, 2012 to December 31, 2012. An equally offsetting amortization of the unamortized
energy contract liability has been recorded at Exelon Corporate in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.         
  The fair value of the Constellation trade name intangible asset was determined based on the relief from royalty method of the income approach
whereby fair value is determined to be the present value of the license fees avoided by owning the assets. The measure is based upon certain unobservable   
         269   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key assumptions include the hypothetical royalty rate and the discount rate. Exelon s and
Generation s straight line amortization expense for the fair value of the Constellation trade name intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the period March 12, 2012 to December 31, 2012 amounted to $26
million and $20 million, respectively. The trade name intangible asset is included in deferred debits and other assets within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.            The fair value of the retail relationships was determined based on a  multi-period excess method  of the income
approach. Under this method, the intangible asset s fair value is determined to be the estimated future cash flows that will be earned on the current customer base, taking into account expected contract renewals based on customer attrition
rates and costs to retain those customers. The measure is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key assumptions include the customer attrition rate and the discount
rate. The intangible assets for the fair value of the retail relationships are amortized as amortization expense on a straight line basis over the useful life of the underlying assets. Exelon s and Generation s straight line amortization
expense for year ended December 31, 2013 and for the period March 12, 2012 to December 31, 2012 amounted to $21 million and $15 million, respectively. The retail relationships intangible assets are included in deferred debits and
other assets within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.            Exelon s intangible assets and liabilities acquired through the merger with Constellation included in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with the future estimated amortization, were as follows as of
December 31, 2013:         

(a)  
  Includes the fair value of BGE s power and gas supply contracts of $12 million for which an offsetting Exelon Corporate regulatory asset was also recorded.

(b)  
  Weighted average amortization period was calculated as of the date of acquisition.     
          Impact of Merger     
        It is impracticable to determine the overall financial statement
impact for the Constellation subsidiaries contributed down to Generation following the Upstream Merger for the year ended December 31, 2012. Upon closing of the merger, the operations of these Constellation subsidiaries were integrated into
Generation s operations and are therefore not fully distinguishable after the merger.            The impact of BGE on Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income includes operating revenues of $3,065 million and $2,091 million and net income (loss) of $210 million and
$(31) million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.         
  During the year ended December 31, 2013, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE incurred merger and integration-related costs of $142 million,
$106 million, $16 million, $9 million and $6 million, respectively. Of these amounts, Exelon, ComEd and BGE deferred $17 million, $11 million and $6   
         270   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
million, respectively, as a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, Exelon and BGE established a regulatory asset of $6 million as of December 31, 2013 for previously
incurred 2012 merger and integration-related costs.            During
the year ended December 31, 2012, Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE incurred merger and integration-related costs of $804 million, $340 million, $41 million, $17 million and $182 million, respectively. Of these amounts, Exelon, ComEd and
BGE deferred $58 million, $36 million and $22 million, respectively, as a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2012.         
  The costs incurred are classified primarily within Operating and Maintenance Expense in the Registrants  respective Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, with the exception of the BGE customer rate credit and the credit facility fees, which are included as a reduction to operating revenues and other, net, respectively, for years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.              Pro-forma Impact of the Merger              The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Exelon and Generation as if the merger with Constellation had taken place on January 1, 2011. The
unaudited pro forma information was calculated after applying Exelon s and Generation s accounting policies and adjusting Constellation s results to reflect purchase accounting adjustments.   
        The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have been achieved had the merger events taken place on the dates indicated, or the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.

(a)  
  The amounts above include non-recurring costs directly related to the merger of $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.     

(b)  
  The amounts above include non-recurring costs directly related to the merger of $236 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.     
         Acquisitions (Exelon and Generation)    
        Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined as of the acquisition date through the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions used include:
projected future cash flows (including the amount and timing); discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future power and fuel market prices. Additionally, market prices based on the Market Price Referent (MPR)
established by the CPUC for renewable energy resources were used in determining the fair value of the Antelope Valley assets acquired and liabilities assumed. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to
each class of assets acquired and the duration of the liabilities assumed. Generation did not record any goodwill related to any of the respective acquisitions.

  Generation concluded that the remaining, yet-to-be paid $135 million in consideration was embedded in the amounts payable under the Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC)
agreement for First Solar, Inc. to construct the solar facility. For accounting purposes, this aspect of the transaction is considered to be akin to a  seller financing  arrangement. As such, Generation recorded a liability of $135 million
associated with the portion of the future payments to First Solar, Inc. under the EPC agreement to reflect Generation s implicit amounts due First Solar, Inc. for the remainder of the value of the net assets acquired. The $135 million payable
to First Solar, Inc. will be relieved as Generation makes payments for costs incurred over the project construction period. At December 31, 2012, $87 million remained payable to First Solar, Inc. During 2013, a subsidiary of Generation paid off
the remaining balance of the payable to First Solar, Inc.               Wolf Hollow, LLC.  On August 24, 2011, Generation completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Wolf Hollow, LLC (Wolf Hollow), a combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plant in north
Texas, for a purchase price of $311 million which increased Generation s owned capacity within the ERCOT power market by 720 MWs. The acquisition supports the Exelon commitment to low-carbon generation as part of Exelon 2020.   
        Generation recognized an approximately $36 million non-cash bargain
purchase gain (i.e., negative goodwill). The gain was included within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.            The pro forma impact of this acquisition would not have been material to Exelon s or Generation s results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.         
   Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One.  On September 30, 2011, Generation announced the completion of its acquisition of all of the interests
in Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (Antelope Valley), a 230-MW solar PV project under development in northern Los Angeles County, California, from First Solar, Inc., which is developing, building, operating, and maintaining the project. The first

portion of the project began operations in December 2012, with six additional blocks coming online in 2013. Exelon has been informed by First Solar of issues relating to delays in the
certification of certain components relating to the final two blocks of the project, which will delay commercial operation of these two blocks until the first half of 2014. When fully operational, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest PV solar
projects in the world, with approximately 3.8 million solar panels generating enough clean, renewable electricity to power the equivalent of 75,000 average homes per year. The project has a 25-year PPA, approved by the California Public
Utilities Commission, with Pacific Gas   Electric Company for the full output of the plant. The acquisition supports Exelon s commitment to renewable energy as part of Exelon 2020.   
        Exelon expects to invest up to $650 million in equity in the project
through 2014. The DOE s Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a non-recourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the project. See Note 13 Debt and Credit
Agreements for additional information on the DOE loan guarantee.            The pro forma impact of this acquisition would not have been material to Exelon s or Generation s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.   
           5. Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC
(Exelon and Generation)             As a result of the
Constellation merger, Generation owns a 50.01% interest in CENG, a nuclear generation business. Generation s total equity in earnings (losses) on the investment in CENG is as follows:         
          As of March 12, 2012, Generation
had an initial basis difference of approximately $204 million between the initial carrying value of its investment in CENG and its underlying equity in CENG. This basis difference resulted from the requirement to record the investment in CENG
at fair value under purchase accounting while the underlying assets and liabilities within CENG continue to be accounted for on a historical cost basis. Generation is amortizing this basis difference over the respective useful lives of the assets
and liabilities of CENG or as those assets and liabilities affect the earnings of CENG.            Based on tax sharing provisions contained in the operating agreement for CENG, Generation may be eligible for distributions from its investment in CENG in excess of its 50.01% ownership interest. Through purchase
accounting, Generation has recorded the fair value of expected future distributions. When these distributions are realized, Generation will record a reduction in its investment in CENG. Any distributions in excess of Generation s investment in
CENG would be recorded in earnings.           Generation has various
agreements with CENG to purchase power and to provide certain services. For further information regarding these agreements see Note 25 Related Party Transactions.   
         273   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   On July 29, 2013, Exelon, Generation and subsidiaries of Generation entered into a Master
Agreement with EDF, EDF Inc. (EDFI) (a subsidiary of EDF) and CENG. The Master Agreement contemplates that the parties will execute a series of additional agreements at a closing that will occur following the receipt of regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Exelon currently expects that the closing will occur early in the second quarter of 2014.         
  The Master Agreement requires CENG to make two pre-closing cash distributions to EDF and Generation, if CENG has cash in excess of reserves and the
amount of an outstanding credit facility are available, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, as owners of the joint venture. Generation received the first distribution of $115 million in December 2013 and recorded it as a reduction to the
Investment in CENG on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A second distribution will occur prior to the closing provided that CENG has sufficient available cash.            At the closing, Generation, CENG and subsidiaries of CENG will execute a Nuclear Operating Services Agreement (NOSA)
pursuant to which Generation will operate the CENG nuclear generation fleet owned by CENG subsidiaries and provide corporate and administrative services for the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation
nuclear fleet, subject to EDFI s rights as a member of CENG. CENG will reimburse Generation for its direct and allocated costs for such services. The NOSA will replace the SSA. At the closing, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, a subsidiary of
CENG, will also assign to Generation its obligations as Operator of Nine Mile Point Unit 2 under an operating agreement with the co-owner. In addition, at the closing the PSAA will be amended and extended until the permanent cessation of power
generation by the CENG generation plants.            In addition, at
closing, Generation will make a $400 million loan to CENG, bearing interest at 5.25% per annum and payable out of specified available cash flows of CENG and in any event, payable upon the settlement of the Put Option Agreement discussed below,
if the put option is exercised, or payable upon the maturity date of the note (which will be 20 years from the closing), whichever occurs first. Immediately following receipt of the proceeds of such loan, CENG will make a $400 million special
distribution to EDFI. The parties will also execute a Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for CENG, pursuant to which, among other things, CENG will commit to make preferred distributions to Generation (after repayment of the $400
million loan) quarterly out of specified available cash flows, until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.5% per annum from the date of the special distribution to EDFI.   
        Generation and EDFI will also enter into a Put Option Agreement at
closing pursuant to which EDFI will have the option, exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022, to sell its 49.99% interest in CENG to Generation for a fair market value price determined by agreement of
the parties, or absent agreement, a third-party arbitration process. The appraisers determining fair market value of EDF s 49.99% interest in CENG under the Put Option Agreement are instructed to take into account all rights and obligations
under the CENG Operating Agreement, including Generation s rights with respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return, and the value of Generation s rights to other distributions. The beginning of the
exercise period will be accelerated if Exelon s affiliates cease to own a majority of CENG and exercise a related right to terminate the Nuclear Operating Services Agreement. In addition, under limited circumstances, the period for exercise of
the put option may be extended for 18 months.            Also at
closing, Generation will execute an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation will indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price Anderson Act) in
connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon will guarantee Generation s obligations under this indemnity.   
         274   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Currently, Exelon and Generation account for their investment in CENG under the equity method of
accounting. The transfer of the operating licenses and corresponding operational control to Exelon and Generation will result in Exelon and Generation being required to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of CENG. When that
accounting change occurs, Exelon and Generation will derecognize their equity method investment in CENG and will record all assets, liabilities and the non-controlling interest in CENG at fair value on Exelon and Generation s balance sheets.
Any difference between the former carrying value and newly recorded fair value at that date will be recognized as a gain or loss upon consolidation, which could be material to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations.   
           6. Accounts Receivable (Exelon, Generation, ComEd PECO
and BGE)             Accounts receivable at December 31, 2013
and 2012 included estimated unbilled revenues, representing an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy or services provided to customers, and is net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as follows:   

(a)  
  Represents unbilled portion of retail receivables estimated under Exelon s unbilled critical accounting policy.     

(b)  
  Includes the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer and other accounts receivable.     

(c)  
  Includes an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $8 million and $7 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to PECO s current installment plan
receivables described below.                PECO
Installment Plan Receivables (Exelon and PECO).   PECO enters into payment agreements with certain delinquent customers, primarily residential, seeking to restore their service, as required by the PAPUC. Customers with past due balances that
meet certain income criteria are provided the option to enter into an installment payment plan, some of which have terms greater than one year, to repay past due balances in addition to paying for their ongoing service on a current basis. The
receivable balance for these payment agreement receivables is recorded in accounts receivable for the current portion and other deferred debits and other assets for the noncurrent portion. The net receivable balance for installment plans with terms
greater than one year was $19 million and $18 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reserve methodology and assessment of the credit quality of the installment plan receivables are
consistent with the customer accounts receivable methodology discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance associated with these receivables at December 31, 2013 of $18 million
consists of $1 million, $4 million and $13 million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance at December 31, 2012 of $15 million consists of $1 million, $3 million and $11
million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments, respectively. The balance of the payment agreement is billed to the customer in equal monthly installments over the term of the agreement. Installment receivables outstanding as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012 include balances not yet presented on the customer bill, accounts currently billed and an immaterial amount of past due receivables. When a customer defaults on its payment agreement, the terms of which are defined by
plan type, the entire balance of the agreement becomes due and the balance is reclassified to current customer accounts receivable and reserved for in accordance with the methodology discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.

     Accounts Receivable Agreement (Exelon and PECO).   PECO was party to an agreement with
a financial institution under which it transferred an undivided interest, adjusted daily, in its accounts receivable designated under the agreement in exchange for proceeds of $210 million, which was classified as a short-term note payable on
Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. The agreement terminated on August 30, 2013 and PECO paid down the outstanding principal of $210 million. The financial institution no longer has an
undivided interest in the accounts receivable designated under the agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the financial institution s undivided interest in Exelon s and PECO s gross accounts receivable was equivalent to $289
million, which represented the financial institution s interest in PECO s eligible receivables as calculated under the terms of the agreement. The agreement required PECO to maintain eligible receivables at least equivalent to the
financial institution s undivided interest.

        The following table presents a summary of property, plant and
equipment by asset category as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:         

(b)  
  Includes Generation s buildings under capital lease with a net carrying value of $23 million and $20 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The original
cost basis of the buildings was $59 million and total accumulated amortization was $36 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Also includes ComEd s buildings under capital lease with a net carrying value of
$8 million and $0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The original cost basis of the buildings was $8 million and total accumulated amortization was $0 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Includes land held for future use and non utility property at PECO and BGE. These balances also include capitalized acquisition, development and exploration costs related to oil and gas production activities at Generation.

  Includes buildings under capital lease with a net carrying value of $23 million and $20 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The original cost basis of the
buildings was $59 million and total accumulated amortization was $36 million and $33 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These balances also include capitalized acquisition, development and exploration costs related to oil
and gas production activities.     
          The annual depreciation provisions as a
percentage of average service life for electric generation assets were 3.35%, 3.15% and 3.12% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   
          License Renewals.   Generation s depreciation
provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of its generating stations, which assume the renewal of the licenses for all nuclear generating stations (except for Oyster Creek) and the hydroelectric generating stations. As a result, the receipt
of license renewals has no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding license renewals.   
         Plant Retirements              Schuylkill Station and Riverside Station . On October 31, 2012, Generation notified PJM of its intention to
permanently retire Schuylkill Generating Station Unit 1 by February 1, 2013, and Riverside Generating Station Unit 6 by June 1, 2014. Schuylkill Unit 1 is a 166 MW peaking oil unit located in

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was placed in service in 1958. Riverside Unit 6 is a 115 MW peaking gas/kerosene unit that was placed in service in 1970, located in Baltimore, Maryland. On
December 1, 2013, Generation notified PJM of its intention to permanently retire Riverside Generating Station Unit 4 by June 1, 2016. Riverside Unit 4 is a 74 MW intermediate gas unit that was placed in service in 1951 also located in Baltimore,
Maryland. The units are being retired because they are no longer economic to operate due to their age, relatively high capital and operating costs and declining revenue expectations. On November 30, 2012, PJM notified Generation that it did not
identify any transmission system reliability issues associated with the proposed Schuylkill Unit 1 retirement date, and as a result, Schuylkill Unit 1 was retired on January 1, 2013. On January 7, 2013 and December 23, 2013, PJM notified Generation
that it did not identify any transmission system reliability issues associated with the retirements of Riverside Units 6 and 4, respectively. The early retirements will not have a material impact on Generation or Exelon s results of operations,
cash flows or financial position.             Eddystone Station and
Cromby Station  .  In December 2009, Exelon announced its intention to permanently retire three coal-fired generating units and one oil/gas-fired generating unit, effective May 31, 2011, in response to the economic outlook related to the
continued operation of these four units. However, PJM determined that transmission reliability upgrades would be necessary to alleviate reliability impacts and that those upgrades would be completed in a manner that will permit Generation s
retirement of two of the units on that date and two of the units subsequent to May 31, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Cromby Generating Station (Cromby) Unit 1 and Eddystone Generating Station (Eddystone) Unit 1 were retired. On May 27, 2011, the FERC
approved a settlement providing for a reliability-must-run rate schedule, which defined compensation to be paid to Generation for continuing to operate Cromby Unit 2 and Eddystone Unit 2. The monthly fixed-cost recovery during the
reliability-must-run period for Eddystone Unit 2 was approximately $6 million, and covered operating costs, plus a return on net assets, of the two units during the reliability-must-run period. In addition, Generation was reimbursed for variable
costs, including fuel, emissions costs, chemicals, auxiliary power and for project investment costs during the reliability-must-run period. Eddystone Unit 2 and Cromby Unit 2 operated under the reliability-must-run agreement from June 1, 2011 until
their respective retirement dates, Cromby Unit 2 on December 31, 2011 and Eddystone Unit 2 on May 31, 2012.         
  During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, Generation incurred $1 million, $11 million, and $2 million of shut down costs reflected
within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Expense for the write down of inventory was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011.

   Long-Lived Assets (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation evaluates long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. In the third quarter of 2013, lower projected wind production and a decline in power prices suggested that the carrying value of certain wind projects may be impaired. Generation concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows and fair value of eleven wind projects, primarily located in West Texas and Minnesota, were less than their respective carrying values at September 30, 2013. The fair value analysis was primarily based on the income approach using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. As a result, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $75 million
were written down to their fair value of $32 million and a pre-tax impairment charge of $43 million was recorded during the third quarter in operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Of the $43 million, $4 million was attributable to non-controlling interests for certain of the wind projects.

    Nuclear Uprate Program (Exelon and Generation)             Generation is engaged in individual projects as part of a planned power uprate program across its nuclear fleet. When
economically viable, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and application of expertise gained from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Based on ongoing reviews, the nuclear uprate
implementation plan was adjusted during 2013 to cancel certain projects. The Measurement Uncertainty Recapture (MUR) uprate projects at the Dresden and Quad Cities nuclear stations were cancelled as a result of the cost of additional plant
modifications identified during final design work which, when combined with then current market conditions, made the projects not economically viable. Additionally, the market conditions prompted Generation to cancel the previously deferred
extended power uprate projects at the LaSalle and Limerick nuclear stations. During 2013, Generation recorded a pre-tax charge to operating and maintenance expense and interest expense of approximately $111 million and $8 million, respectively, to
accrue remaining costs and reverse the previously capitalized costs.         
   Like-Kind Exchange Transaction (Exelon)          
  Prior to the PECO/Unicom Merger in October 2000, UII, LLC (formerly Unicom Investments, Inc.) (UII), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon, entered
into a like-kind exchange transaction pursuant to which approximately $1.6 billion was invested in coal-fired generating station leases located in Georgia and Texas with two separate entities unrelated to Exelon. The generating stations were leased
back to such entities as part of the transaction. See Note 14 Income Taxes for further information. For financial accounting purposes, the investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. UII holds the leasehold interests in
the generating stations in several separate bankruptcy remote, special purpose companies it directly or indirectly wholly owns. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the lease terms. If the lessees do not
exercise the fixed purchase options, Exelon has the ability to require the lessees to return the leasehold interests or to arrange for a third-party to bid on a service contract for a period following the lease term. If Exelon chooses the service
contract option, the leasehold interests will be returned to Exelon at the end of the term of the service contract. In any event, Exelon will be subject to residual value risk if the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options. This risk is
partially mitigated by the fair value of the scheduled payments under the service contract. However, such payments are not guaranteed. Further, the term of the service contract is less than the expected remaining useful life of the plants and,
therefore, Exelon s exposure to residual value risk will not be mitigated by payments under the service contract in this remaining period. In the fourth quarter of 2000, under the terms of the lease agreements, UII received a prepayment of $1.2
billion for all rent, which reduced the investment in the leases. There are no minimum scheduled lease payments to be received over the remaining term of the leases.   
        Pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance, Exelon is required to
review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease investments at least annually and record an impairment charge if the review indicates an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the residual values below their carrying
values. Exelon estimates the fair value of the residual values of its direct financing lease investments under the income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis, which takes into consideration significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)
including the expected revenues to be generated and costs to be incurred to operate the plants over their remaining useful lives subsequent to the lease end dates. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include fundamental energy
and capacity prices, fixed and variable costs, capital expenditure requirements, discount rates, tax rates, and the estimated remaining useful lives of the plants. The estimated fair values also reflect the cash flows associated with the service
contract option discussed above given that a market participant would take into consideration all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease agreements.   
         281   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Based on the review performed in the second quarter of 2013, the estimated residual value of one
of Exelon s direct financing leases experienced an other than temporary decline given reduced long-term energy and capacity price expectations. As a result, Exelon recorded a $14 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter of 2013,
which was recorded in investments and operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Operations, respectively. Changes in the assumptions described above could potentially result in future
impairments of Exelon s direct financing lease investments, which could be material. Through December 31, 2013, no events have occurred that would require Exelon to review the estimated residual values of its direct financing lease
investments subsequent to the review performed in the second quarter of 2013.            As of December 31, 2012, Exelon concluded that the estimated fair values of the residual values at the end of the lease terms exceeded the residual values established at the lease dates.   
        At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the components of
the net investment in long-term leases were as follows:         
             9. Jointly Owned Electric
Utility Plant (Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE)          
  Exelon, Generation, PECO and BGE s undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities at
December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Generation also owns a proportionate share in the fossil fuel combustion turbine at Salem, which is fully depreciated. The gross book value was $3 million at December 31,
2013 and 2012.     

(b)  
  Generation s ownership interest in Keystone and Conemaugh has increased as a result of Exelon s merger with Constellation in 2012. See Note 4 Merger and
Acquisitions for additional information.     

(c)  
  PECO and BGE own a 22% and 7% share, respectively, in 127 miles of 500 kV lines located in Pennsylvania; PECO and BGE also own a 20.7% and 10.56% share, respectively, of a 500 kV
substation immediately outside of the Conemaugh fossil generating station which supplies power to the 500 kV lines including, but not limited to, the lines noted above.     
         282   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(d)  
  PECO owns a 42.55% share in 131 miles of 500 kV lines located in Delaware and New Jersey as well as a 42.55% share in a 500kV substation immediately outside of the Salem nuclear
generating station in New Jersey which supplies power to the 500kV lines including, but not limited to, the lines noted above.     

(e)  
  Generation has a 44.24% ownership interest in Merrill Creek Reservoir located in New Jersey.     

(f)  
  Excludes asset retirement costs.           
  Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s and BGE s undivided ownership interests are financed with their funds and all operations are
accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly owned facilities. Exelon s, Generation s, PECO s and BGE s share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are included in fuel and operating and maintenance
expenses on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and in operating and maintenance expenses on PECO s and BGE s Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
           10. Intangible Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and
PECO)              Goodwill    
        Exelon s and ComEd s gross amount of goodwill, accumulated
impairment losses and carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom (predecessor parent company of ComEd) merger net of amortization, resolution of tax matters and other
non-impairment-related changes as allowed under previous authoritative guidance.              Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the
ComEd reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance for goodwill, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for
impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment
for its combined business. There is no level below this operating segment for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, ComEd s operating segment is considered its only reporting unit.
           Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option
of first performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step one of the two-step fair value based impairment test). If an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value
of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step fair value based impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.   
        If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the
qualitative assessment, but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step, fair value based test is performed. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to
its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit   
         283   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation in order to
determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Any goodwill impairment charge at
ComEd will affect Exelon s consolidated results of operations.            ComEd s valuation approach is based on a market participant view, pursuant to authoritative guidance for fair value measurement, and utilizes a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a
market multiples analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis relies on a single scenario reflecting  base case  or  best estimate  projected cash flows for ComEd s business and includes an estimate of ComEd s terminal
value based on these expected cash flows using the generally accepted Gordon Dividend Growth formula, which derives a valuation using an assumed perpetual annuity based on the entity s residual cash flows. The discount rate is based on the
generally accepted Capital Asset Pricing Model and represents the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. The market multiples analysis utilizes multiples of business enterprise value to earnings, before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of comparable companies in estimating fair value. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected
operating and capital cash flows from ComEd s business and the fair value of debt. Management performs a reconciliation of the sum of the estimated fair value of all Exelon reporting units to Exelon s enterprise value based on its trading
price to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow analysis and the market multiple analysis.         
    2013 Goodwill Impairment Assessments.   Management concluded the remeasurement of the like-kind exchange position and the charge to
ComEd s earnings in the first quarter of 2013 triggered an interim goodwill impairment assessment and, as a result, ComEd tested its goodwill for impairment as of January 31, 2013. The first step of the interim impairment assessment
comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill; therefore, the second step was not required.   
        ComEd performed a quantitative assessment as of November 1, 2013,
for its 2013 annual goodwill impairment assessment. The first step of the annual impairment assessment comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill; therefore, the second
step was not required.            In both the interim and annual
assessments, the discounted cash flow analysis reflected Exelon s indemnity to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of the after-tax interest amounts related to the like-kind exchange position on ComEd s equity. While neither
the interim nor the annual assessments indicated an impairment of ComEd s goodwill, certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value of ComEd are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions, such as early termination of EIMA, or
changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows from ComEd s business, and the fair value of debt could potentially result
in a future impairment of ComEd s goodwill, which could be material. Based on the results of the annual goodwill test performed as of November 1, 2013, the estimated fair value of ComEd would have needed to decrease by more than 10% for
ComEd to fail the first step of the impairment test.         
    Prior Goodwill Impairment Assessments.   Management concluded that the May 2012 ICC final Order in ComEd s 2011 formula rate
proceeding triggered an interim goodwill impairment assessment and, as a result, ComEd tested its goodwill for impairment as of May 31, 2012. The first step of the   
         284   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
interim impairment assessment comparing the estimated fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill; therefore, the second step was not
required. ComEd performed a qualitative assessment as of November 1, 2012, for its 2012 annual goodwill impairment assessment and determined that its fair value was not more likely than not less than its carrying value. Therefore, ComEd did not
perform a quantitative assessment. As part of its qualitative assessment, ComEd evaluated, among other things, management s best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd s business (including the impacts of the May
2012 Order) as well as changes in certain other market conditions, such as the discount rate and EBITDA multiples.             Other Intangible Assets             For discussion surrounding Exelon s and Generation s unamortized energy contracts, trade name and retail relationships recorded in conjunction with the Merger, refer to Note 4 Merger and
Acquisitions.            Exelon s, Generation s and
ComEd s other intangible assets, included in unamortized energy contract assets and deferred debits and other assets in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2013:   

(a)  
  In December 2010, Generation acquired all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (later named Exelon Wind), adding 735 MWs of installed, operating wind capacity
located in eight states.     

(b)  
  Refer to Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions for additional information regarding Antelope Valley.     

(c)  
  In March 1999, ComEd entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Chicago associated with ComEd s franchise agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, ComEd
agreed to make payments to the City of Chicago each year from 1999 to 2002. The intangible asset recognized as a result of these payments is being amortized ratably over the remaining term of the franchise agreement, which ends in 2020.

(d)  
  In February 2003, ComEd entered into separate agreements with the City of Chicago and with Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation). Under the terms of the settlement
agreement with the City of Chicago, ComEd agreed to pay the City of Chicago a total of $60 million over a ten-year period, beginning in 2003. The intangible asset recognized as a result of the settlement agreement is being amortized ratably over the
remaining term of the City of Chicago franchise agreement, which ends in 2020. As required by the settlement, ComEd also made a payment of $2 million to a third-party on the City of Chicago s behalf. Under the terms of the agreement with
Midwest Generation, ComEd received payments of $32 million from Midwest Generation to relieve Midwest Generation s obligation under the 1999 fossil sale agreement with ComEd to build the generation facility in the City of Chicago. The payments
received by ComEd, which have been recorded in other long-term liabilities, are being recognized ratably (approximately $2 million annually) as an offset to amortization expense over the remaining term of the franchise agreement.

(e)  
  Weighted-average amortization period was calculated at the date of acquisition for acquired assets or settlement agreement.     

(f)  
  Excludes $67 million of other miscellaneous unamortized energy contracts that have been acquired at various points in time.

   The following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets for each of
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         
            Acquired Intangible Assets
             Accounting guidance for business combinations
requires that the acquirer must recognize separately identifiable intangible assets in the application of purchase accounting. The valuation of the acquired intangible assets discussed below were estimated by applying the income approach, which is
based upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the respective PPAs. Key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets include forecasted power prices and discount rates. Those measures are based upon certain
unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. The intangible assets are amortized as a decrease in operating revenue within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income over the term of the underlying PPAs.              Exelon Wind.   The output of the acquired wind turbines has been sold under PPA contracts. The excess of the contract price of the PPAs over market prices was recognized as intangible assets at the
acquisition date. Generation determined that the estimated acquisition-date fair value of the intangible assets was approximately $224 million, which is recorded in unamortized energy contract assets within Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the associated contract revenues are recognized.   
          Antelope Valley.   Upon completion of the development
project, all of the output will be sold under a PPA with Pacific Gas   Electric Company. The excess of the contract price of the PPA over forecasted MPR-based market prices was recognized as an intangible asset at the acquisition date.
Generation determined that the estimated acquisition-date fair value of the intangible asset was approximately $190 million, which is recorded in unamortized energy contract assets within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The fair value is amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the present value of the underlying cash flows as of the acquisition date.         
    Renewable Energy Credits and Alternative Energy Credits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).            
        Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s other
intangible assets, included in other current assets and other deferred debits and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, include RECs (Exelon, Generation and ComEd) and AECs (Exelon and PECO). Revenue for RECs that are part of a bundled
power sale is recognized when the power is produced and delivered to the customer. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, PECO had current AECs of $19 million and $17 million, respectively, and noncurrent AECs of $5 million and $9 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, Generation had current RECs of $158 million and $61 million, respectively, and noncurrent RECs of $0 million and $45 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, and 2012, ComEd, had
current RECs of $3 million and $4 million, respectively. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on RECs and AECs.

           Short-Term Liabilities.  The
short-term liabilities included in the tables above are comprised of short-term borrowings (Level 2), short-term notes payable related to PECO s accounts receivable agreement (Level 2), and dividends payable (Level 1). The Registrants 
carrying amounts of the short-term liabilities are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on PECO s accounts receivable
agreement.             Long-Term Debt.  The fair value amounts of
Exelon s taxable debt securities (Level 2) are determined by a valuation model that is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. In order to incorporate the credit risk
of the Registrants into the discount rates, Exelon obtains pricing (i.e., U.S. Treasury rate plus credit spread) based on trades of existing Exelon debt securities as well as debt securities of other issuers in the electric utility sector with
similar credit ratings in both the primary and secondary market, across the Registrants  debt maturity spectrum. The credit spreads of various tenors obtained from this information are added to the appropriate benchmark U.S. Treasury rates in
order to determine the current market yields for the various tenors. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note.   
        The fair value of Generation s non-government-backed fixed rate
project financing debt (Level 3) is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other project financing debt with similar risk profiles. Given the low trading volume in the project financing debt market, the price quotes used to determine fair
value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly impact the project cash flows or off-taker credit, and other circumstances related to the project (e.g., political
and regulatory environment). The fair value of Generation s government-back fixed rate project financing debt (Level 3) is largely based on a discounted cash flow methodology that is similar to the taxable debt securities methodology described
above. Due to the lack of market trading data on similar debt, the discount rates are derived based on the original loan interest rate spread to the applicable Treasury rate as well as a current market curve derived from government-backed
securities. Variable rate project financing debt resets on a quarterly basis and the carrying value approximates fair value.         
  The Registrants also have tax-exempt debt (Level 3). Due to low trading volume in this market, qualitative factors, such as market conditions,
investor demand, and circumstances related to the issuer (i.e., political and regulatory environment), may be incorporated into the credit spreads that are used to obtain the fair value as described above.   
         SNF Obligation.  The carrying amount of Generation s SNF
obligation (Level 2) is derived from a contract with the DOE to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. When determining the fair value of the obligation, the future carrying amount of the SNF obligation
  
         288

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
estimated to be settled in 2025 is calculated by compounding the current book value of the SNF obligation at the 13-week Treasury rate. The compounded obligation amount is discounted back to
present value using Generation s discount rate, which is calculated using the same methodology as described above for the taxable debt securities, and an estimated maturity date of 2025.             Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts.  Exelon s long-term debt to financing trusts is valued based on publicly
traded securities issued by the financing trusts. Due to low trading volume of these securities, qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to each issue, this debt is classified as Level 3.
            Preferred Securities.  The fair value of these
securities is determined based on the last closing price prior to quarter end, less accrued interest. The securities are registered with the SEC and are public. PECO redeemed all outstanding series of preferred securities on May 1, 2013. See
Note 20 Earnings Per Share and Equity for additional information.              Recurring Fair Value Measurements              Exelon records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established by the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:         

Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to access as of the reporting
date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities and funds, certain exchange-based derivatives, and money market funds.      

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, derivatives, commingled and mutual investment funds priced at NAV per fund share and fair value hedges.

Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market
activity for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded securities and derivatives, and investments priced using an alternative pricing mechanism or third party valuation.

         304   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).  The Registrants  cash
equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in the fair value tables are comprised of investments in mutual and money market funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds
are based on observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.         
   Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  The trust fund
investments have been established to satisfy Generation s nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds. Generation s investment
policies place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the trusts. These policies limit the trust funds  exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments.
Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.
           With respect to individually held equity securities, the
trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Generation is able to independently corroborate. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based
on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. Equity securities held individually are primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-Global Select Market, which contain only actively traded securities due to the
volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges.            For
fixed income securities, multiple prices from pricing services are obtained whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type,
class or issue for each security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the
trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Generation has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally,
Generation selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. U.S. Treasury securities are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of
fixed income securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in
Level 2. The fair values of private placement fixed income securities are determined using a third party valuation that contains certain significant unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.   
        Equity and fixed income commingled funds and fixed income mutual funds
are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The fair values of fixed income commingled and mutual funds held within the trust funds, which generally hold short-term fixed
income securities and are not subject to restrictions regarding the purchase or sale of shares, are derived from observable prices. The objectives of the remaining equity commingled funds in which Exelon and Generation invest primarily seek to track
the performance of certain equity indices by purchasing equity securities to replicate the capitalization and characteristics of the indices. Commingled and mutual funds are categorized in Level 2 because the fair value of the funds are based on
NAVs per fund share (the unit of account), primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying equity securities.   
         305

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Middle market lending are investments in loans or managed funds which invest in private companies.
Generation elected the fair value option for its investments in certain limited partnerships that invest in middle market lending managed funds. The fair value of these loans is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost
models, market models, and income models. Investments in middle market lending are categorized as Level 3 because the fair value of these securities is based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. Investments
in middle market lending typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan.             Rabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE).  The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of
Exelon s executive management and directors. The investments in the Rabbi trusts are included in investments in the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of mutual funds. These funds are maintained by investment
companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. Mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear
observability of the prices.             Mark-to-Market Derivatives
(Exelon, Generation, and ComEd) . Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the
fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives  pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the
bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an
orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an
industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit
worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants  derivatives are
predominately at liquid trading points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis
adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.   
        Transfers in and out of levels are recognized as of the end of the
reporting period the transfer occurred. Given derivatives categorized within Level 1 are valued using exchange-based quoted prices within observable periods, transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 were not material. Transfers into Level 2 from Level
3 generally occur when the contract tenure becomes more observable. Transfers into Level 3 from Level 2 generally occur due to changes in market liquidity or assumptions for certain commodity contracts.   
        Exelon may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are
typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation
of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on
and discounted by the market s expectation of   
         306

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on
observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion on mark-to-market derivatives.
            Deferred Compensation Obligations (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE).  The Registrants  deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in
their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants  deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants  notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual
funds, which are based on observable market prices. However, since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.   
          Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd)               Mark-to-Market
Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd).  For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This
includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in
valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Exelon s RMC
approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief
financial officer, corporate controller, general counsel, treasurer, vice president of strategy, vice president of audit services and officers representing Exelon s business units. The RMC reports to the Exelon board of directors on the scope
of the risk management activities and is responsible for approving all valuation procedures at Exelon. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio are reviewed and verified by the middle office and
used for financial reporting by the back office. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of
credit and nonperformance risk by counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.   
        Disclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants  significant
Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and notional size. Generation s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas, coal purchases,
certain transmission congestion contracts, and project financing debt. Generation utilizes various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions
about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and
credit enhancements.

   For commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity
price curve for each instrument. Forward commodity price curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management
considering published exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of
factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the
credit quality of each counterparty for assets and Generation s own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price is generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery
locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural gas) are highly liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve
used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread
does not typically represent a majority of the instrument s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change
in the spread is generally immaterial. An average spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $3.92 and $0.12 for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in
nature and thus a majority of the fair value may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for information
regarding the maturity by year of the Registrant s mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities.         
  On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the
procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for more information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions
and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using natural gas heat rates to project long term forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate
renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to the positions based on the tenor and supplier risk.

   The table below discloses the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these
positions.         

a)  
  The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for the asset and liability positions.

  Quoted forward natural gas rates are utilized to project the forward power curve for the delivery of energy at specified future dates. The natural gas curve is extrapolated
beyond its observable period to the end of the contract s delivery.     

c)  
  The fair values do not include cash collateral held on Level 3 positions of $26 million as of December 31, 2013.     

d)  
  The upper ends of the ranges are driven by the winter power and gas prices in the New England region. Without the New England region, the upper ends of the ranges for power and
gas would be approximately $100 and $5.70, respectively.

        The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values
of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is volatility. Increases (decreases) in
the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions
(contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity). Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward
commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair
value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.   
         Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and Pledged Assets
for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  For middle market lending, certain corporate debt securities, and private equity investments the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models,
market models and income models. The valuation estimates are based on valuations of comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company or
its assets, considering offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company, its historical and projected financial results, as well as other factors that may impact value. Significant judgment is required in the application of discounts or
premiums applied to the prices of comparable companies for factors such as size, marketability, credit risk and relative performance.        
  Because Generation relies on third-party fund managers to develop the quantitative unobservable inputs without adjustment for the valuations of
its  Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Generation. This includes information regarding the sensitivity of the fair values to
changes in the unobservable inputs. Generation gains an understanding of the fund managers  inputs and assumptions used in preparing the valuations. Generation performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. For a sample of
its  Level 3 investments, Generation reviewed independent valuations and reviewed the assumptions in the detailed pricing models used by the fund managers.         
  As of December 31, 2013, Generation has outstanding commitments to invest in middle market lending, corporate debt securities, and private
equity investments of approximately $448 million. These commitments will be funded by Generation s existing nuclear decommissioning trust funds.         
     12. Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants are exposed to certain risks related to ongoing
business operations. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk.   
         310   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Commodity Price Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)     
        To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the
amount of energy it has contracted to sell, the Registrants are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. The Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks
associated with market fluctuations by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. The
Registrants believe these instruments, which are classified as either economic hedges or non-derivatives, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.         
  Derivative accounting guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in
fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing
basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include normal purchase normal sale (NPNS), cash flow hedge, and fair value hedge. For commodity transactions, effective with the date of merger with Constellation, Generation no longer
utilizes the special election provided for by the cash flow hedge designation and de-designated all of its existing cash flow hedges prior to the merger. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remain at least reasonably possible, the fair
value of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated OCI and reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. None of
Constellation s designated cash flow hedges for commodity transactions prior to the merger were re-designated as cash flow hedges. The effect of this decision is that all derivative economic hedges for commodities are recorded at fair value
through earnings for the combined company, referred to as economic hedges in the following tables. The Registrants have applied the NPNS scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power procurement
agreements, and natural gas supply agreements. Non-derivative contracts for access to additional generation and certain sales to load-serving entities are accounted for primarily under the accrual method of accounting, which is further discussed in
Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies. Additionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation s energy marketing
portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s overall energy marketing activities.             Economic Hedging.  The Registrants are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities associated with price movements
resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. Generation
uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements and
other energy-related products marketed and purchased. In order to manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of energy and
purchases of fuel and energy. The objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on electric generation operations, fixing the
price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of power plants, and fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply load-serving customers. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based
upon management s policies and hedging objectives, the market, weather conditions, operational and other factors. Generation is also exposed to   
         311   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include
derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an accrual basis.   
        In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a
positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity price risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2013,
the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segments was 92%-95%, 62%-65% and 30%-33% for 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the
expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain
non-derivative contracts, including Generation s sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.         
  In order to fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, Generation and ComEd entered into a five-year financial swap contract that
expired May 31, 2013. The financial swap was designed to hedge spot market purchases, which, along with ComEd s remaining energy procurement contracts, met its load service requirements. The terms of the financial swap contract required
Generation to pay the around-the-clock market price for a portion of ComEd s electricity supply requirement, while ComEd paid a fixed price.         
  As the contract expired May 31, 2013, all realized impacts have been included in Generation s and ComEd s results of operations. In
Exelon s consolidated financial statements, all financial statement effects of the financial swap recorded by Generation and ComEd are eliminated.         
  In addition, the physical contracts that Generation has entered into with ComEd and that ComEd has entered into with Generation and other suppliers
as part of the ComEd power procurement process, which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters, qualify and are accounted for under the NPNS exception. Based on the Illinois Settlement Legislation and ICC-approved procurement
methodologies permitting ComEd to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up, ComEd s price risk related to power procurement is limited.   
        On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year
floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. Pursuant to the ICC s Order on December 19, 2012,
ComEd s commitments under the existing long-term contracts for energy and associated RECs were reduced in the first quarter of 2013. These contracts are designed to lock in a portion of the long-term commodity price risk resulting from the
renewable energy resource procurement requirements in the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial instruments. ComEd records the fair value of the swap contracts on its balance sheet.
Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional
information.            PECO has contracts to procure electric supply
that were executed through the competitive procurement process outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Programs, which are further discussed in Note 3 Regulatory Matters. Based on Pennsylvania legislation and the DSP Programs permitting
  
         312   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
PECO to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up, PECO s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. PECO locked in fixed prices
for a significant portion of its commodity price risk through full requirements contracts and block contracts. PECO has certain full requirements contracts and block contracts, that are considered derivatives and qualify for the NPNS scope exception
under current derivative authoritative guidance.         
  PECO s natural gas procurement policy is designed to achieve a reasonable balance of long-term and short-term gas purchases under different
pricing approaches in order to achieve system supply reliability at the least cost. PECO s reliability strategy is two-fold. First, PECO must assure that there is sufficient transportation capacity to satisfy delivery requirements. Second, PECO
must ensure that a firm source of supply exists to utilize the capacity resources. All of PECO s natural gas supply and asset management agreements that are derivatives either qualify for the NPNS scope exception and have been designated as
such, or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced. Additionally, in accordance with the 2013 PAPUC PGC settlement and to reduce the exposure of PECO and its customers to natural gas price volatility, PECO has
continued its program to purchase natural gas for both winter and summer supplies using a layered approach of locking-in prices ahead of each season with long-term gas purchase agreements (those with primary terms of at least twelve months). Under
the terms of the 2013 PGC settlement, PECO is required to lock in (i.e., economically hedge) the price of a minimum volume of its long-term gas commodity purchases. PECO s gas-hedging program is designed to cover about 30% of planned natural
gas purchases in support of projected firm sales. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on PECO s financial position or results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.
           BGE has contracts to procure SOS electric supply that are
executed through a competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC. The SOS rates charged recover BGE s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee. The administrative fee includes an incremental cost component and a
shareholder return component for commercial and industrial rate classes. BGE s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. BGE locks in fixed prices for all of its SOS requirements through full requirements contracts.
Certain of BGE s full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for the NPNS scope exception under current derivative authoritative guidance. Other BGE full requirements contracts are not derivatives.   
        BGE provides natural gas to its customers under a MBR mechanism
approved by the MDPSC. Under this mechanism, BGE s actual cost of gas is compared to a market index (a measure of the market price of gas in a given period). The difference between BGE s actual cost and the market index is shared equally
between shareholders and customers. BGE must also secure fixed price contracts for at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of forecasted system supply requirements for flowing (i.e., non-storage) gas for the November through March period. These
fixed-price contracts are not subject to sharing under the MBR mechanism. BGE also ensures it has sufficient pipeline transportation capacity to meet customer requirements. All of BGE s natural gas supply and asset management agreements qualify
for the NPNS scope exception and result in physical delivery.         
   Proprietary Trading.  Generation also enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading
includes all contracts entered into with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those entered into with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Proprietary trading activities are subject to limits established
by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading activities, which included settled physical sales volumes of 8,762 GWh, 12,958 GWh and 5,742 Gwh for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, are a complement to
  
         313   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s revenue from energy marketing activities. ComEd, PECO and BGE do not enter into derivatives for
proprietary trading purposes.              Interest Rate and
Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as
fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges.
These strategies are employed to manage interest rate risks. At December 31, 2013, Exelon had $1,425 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and $190 million of notional amounts of floating-to-fixed hedges
outstanding. Assuming the fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges are 100% effective, a hypothetical 50 bps increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps
would result in an approximate $5 million decrease in Exelon Consolidated pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S.
dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. Below is a summary of the interest rate and foreign currency hedges as of December 31, 2013.   

(a)  
  Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity positions. The
characterization of the interest rate derivative contracts between the proprietary trading activity in the above table is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that gives rise to the interest rate
exposure. Generation does not utilize proprietary trading interest rate derivatives with the objective of benefiting from shifts or changes in market interest rates.

(b)  
  Represents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty and any associated cash collateral.     
         Fair Value Hedges . For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. Exelon includes the gain or loss on the
hedged items and the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps in interest expense as follows:         

(a)  
  For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the loss on Generation swaps included $16 million and $12 realized in earnings, respectively, with $2 million and an
immaterial amount excluded from hedge effectiveness testing, respectively.              During the third and fourth quarters of 2013, Exelon entered into $625 million of notional amounts of fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps, which expire in 2020. At December 31,
2013, Exelon and Generation had total outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $1,275 million and $550 million, with unrealized gains of $26 million and $23 million, respectively. At December 31, 2012,
Exelon and Generation had outstanding fixed-to-floating fair value hedges related to interest rate swaps of $650 million and $550 million that expire in 2015, with unrealized gains of $49 million and $38 million, respectively. During the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from fair value hedges was a $2 million gain and immaterial, respectively.   
         315   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Cash Flow Hedges . In anticipation of the Continental Wind, LLC non-recourse project
financing that was completed on September 30, 2013, Exelon entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the change in benchmark interest rates. Upon settlement of the swaps, a $26 million
effective gain in OCI was deferred and will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt. See Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on the project financing.   
        In connection with the DOE guaranteed loan for the Antelope Valley
acquisition, as discussed in Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements, Generation entered into a floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $485 million and a mandatory early termination date of April 5,
2014. The swap hedges approximately 75% of Generation s future interest rate exposure associated with the financing and was designated as a cash flow hedge. As such, the effective portion of the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive
income within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any ineffectiveness recorded in Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Net gains (or losses) from settlement of the hedges, to the extent
effective, are amortized as an adjustment to the interest expense over the term of the DOE guaranteed loan.         
  Every time Generation draws down on the loan, an offsetting hedge (fixed-to-floating) is executed and a portion of the cash flow hedge with a
notional amount equal to the offsetting hedge, is de-designated and the related gains or losses going forward are reflected in earnings, which are largely offset by the losses or gains in the offsetting hedge.   
        Antelope Valley received its first loan advance on April 5, 2012,
and a series of additional advances subsequently. Generation has entered into a series of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregated notional amount of $350 million, approximately 75% of the loan advance amount to offset portions of
the original interest rate hedge, which are not designated as cash flow hedges. The remaining cash flow hedge has a notional amount of $135 million. At December 31, 2013, Generation s mark-to-market non-current derivative liability
relating to the interest rate swaps in connection with the loan agreement to fund Antelope Valley was $10 million.         
  During the third quarter of 2011, a subsidiary of Constellation entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage a portion of the
interest rate exposure for anticipated long-term borrowings to finance Sacramento PV Energy. The swaps have a total notional amount of $28 million as of December 31, 2013 and expire in 2027. After the closing of the merger with Constellation,
the swaps were re-designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2013, the subsidiary had a $1 million derivative liability related to these swaps.         
  During the third quarter of 2012, a subsidiary of Exelon Generation entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to manage a portion of the
interest rate exposure of anticipated long-term borrowings to finance Constellation Solar Horizons. The swap has a notional amount of $27 million as of December 31, 2013, and expires in 2030. This swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. At
December 31, 2013, the subsidiary had a $2 million derivative asset related to the swap.            During the years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012, the impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges was immaterial.   
         Economic Hedges.  At December 31, 2013, Generation had $144
million in notional amounts of interest rate derivative contracts to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate

component of commodity positions and $195 million in notional amounts of foreign currency exchange rate swaps that are marked-to-market to manage the exposure associated with international
purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. dollars.            At December 31, 2013, Exelon and Generation had $150 million in notional amounts of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are marked-to-market, with unrealized gains of $2 million. These swaps, which were
acquired as part of the merger with Constellation, expire in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, and the period from March 12 to December 31, 2012, the impact on the results of operations was immaterial.

Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Fair value accounting guidance and disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative instruments to be shown in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross
basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that
may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other providing for the net settlement of all referencing contracts via one payment stream, which takes place either as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of
default. Generation s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless Generation is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1). In the table below, Generation s energy-related economic hedges and proprietary trading
derivatives are shown gross and the impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, is aggregated in the collateral and
netting column. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, $10 million of cash collateral posted and $3 million of cash collateral received, respectively, was not offset against derivative positions because such collateral was not associated with any
energy-related derivatives or as of the balance sheet date there were no positions to offset. Excluded from the tables below are economic hedges that qualify for the NPNS scope exception and other non-derivative contracts that are accounted for
under the accrual method of accounting.            ComEd s use of
cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade (i.e. to BB+ or Ba1).         
  Cash collateral held by PECO and BGE must be deposited in a non affiliate major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that
meet certain qualifications.

   The following table provides a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded by the
Registrants as of December 31, 2013:         

(a)  
  Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions
with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures, subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as trade receivables
and payables, transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit and other forms of non-cash collateral. These are not reflected in the table above.     

(b)  
  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $84 million and $72 million, respectively, and current and noncurrent liabilities are shown net of collateral of
$(12) million and $0 million, respectively. The total cash collateral posted, net of cash collateral received and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $144 million at December 31, 2013.     

(c)  
  Includes current and noncurrent liabilities relating to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     
         318

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following table provides a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded by the
Registrants as of December 31, 2012:         

(a)  
  Includes current and noncurrent assets for Generation and current and noncurrent liabilities for ComEd of $226 million related to the fair value of the five-year financial swap
contract between Generation and ComEd, as described above. For Generation, excludes $28 million of noncurrent liability relating to an interest rate swap in connection with a loan agreement to fund Antelope Valley as discussed above.

(b)  
  Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative accounting guidance on the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions
with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures, subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as trade receivables
and payables, transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, and letters of credit. These are not reflected in the table above.     

(c)  
  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $113 million and $201 million, respectively, and current and noncurrent liabilities are shown net of collateral of $
(214) million and $ (131) million, respectively. The total cash collateral received, net of cash collateral posted and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $ (31) million at December 31, 2012.

(d)  
  Includes current and noncurrent liabilities relating to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.     
         Cash Flow Hedges (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).  As discussed
previously, effective prior to the merger with Constellation, Generation de-designated all of its cash flow hedges relating to commodity price risk. Because the underlying forecasted transactions remain at least reasonably possible, the fair value
of the effective portion of these cash flow hedges was frozen in accumulated OCI and is reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs, or becomes probable of not occurring. Generation began
recording prospective   
         319   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
changes in the fair value of these instruments through current earnings from the date of de-designation. Approximately $195 million of these net pre-tax unrealized gains within accumulated OCI
are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI during the next twelve months by Generation. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its cash flow hedges will occur during 2013 through 2014.   
        Exelon discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the
derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item or when it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. For the year ended 2012, the amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the
discontinuance of cash flow hedges was immaterial.           The
tables below provide the activity of accumulated OCI related to cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, containing information about the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges and the reclassification from
accumulated OCI into results of operations. The amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI, when combined with the impacts of the actual physical power sales, result in the ultimate recognition of net revenues at the contracted price.   

(b)  
  Includes $88 million of gains, net of taxes, related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of the five-year financial swap contract with ComEd for the year ended
December 31, 2012. As of the merger date, cash flow hedges were discontinued, as such, this amount represents changes in fair value prior to the merger date.     

(c)  
  Includes $133 million and $375 million of losses, net of taxes, reclassified from accumulated OCI to recognize gains in net income related to settlements of the five-year
financial swap contract with ComEd for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.     

(d)  
  Excludes $5 million of losses and $20 million of losses, net of taxes, related to interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.     

(e)  
  Includes $15 million and $9 million of losses, net of taxes, related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks at
Generation for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.              During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 Generation s former energy-related cash flow hedge activity impact to pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from accumulated
OCI to earnings was a $683 million, $1,368 million and $968 million pre-tax gain, respectively. Given that the cash flow hedges had primarily consisted of forward power sales and   
         320   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
power swaps and did not include power and gas options or sales, the ineffectiveness of Generation s cash flow hedges was primarily the result of differences between the locational settlement
prices of the cash flow hedges and the hedged generating units. Changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness were losses of $5 million and a gain of $10 million for the years ended 2012 and 2011, respectively.   
        Exelon s former energy-related cash flow hedge activity impact to
pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from accumulated OCI to earnings was a $464 million, $747 million and $512 million pre-tax gain for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Changes in cash flow
hedge ineffectiveness, primarily due to changes in market prices, were losses of $5 million and gains of $10 million for the years ended 2012 and 2011, respectively. Neither Exelon nor Generation will incur changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness
in future periods as all energy-related cash flow hedge positions were de-designated prior to the merger date.         
   Economic Hedges (Exelon and Generation).  These instruments represent hedges that economically mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity
prices and include financial options, futures, swaps, physical forward sales and purchases, but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. Additionally, Generation enters into interest rate derivative contracts and foreign
exchange currency swaps to manage the exposure related to the interest rate component of commodity positions and international purchases of commodities in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
the following net pre-tax mark-to-market gains (losses) of certain purchase and sale contracts were reported in operating revenues or purchased power and fuel expense at Exelon and Generation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the tables below,  Change in fair value  represents the
change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement  represents the recognized change in fair value that was reclassified to realized due to settlement of the
derivative during the period.         
 
         321   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(a)  
  Prior to the merger, the five-year financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd was de-designated. As a result, all prospective changes in fair value are recorded to
operating revenues and eliminated in consolidation.     

(b)  
  Exelon and Generation have historically presented mark-to-market gains and losses within purchased power expense for all non-trading, energy-related derivatives that were not
accounted for as cash flow hedges. In 2011, Exelon and Generation classified the mark-to-market gains and losses for contracts, where the underlying hedged transaction was an expected sale to hedge power, to operating revenues.
              Proprietary Trading Activities (Exelon and
Generation).  For the years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012, Exelon and Generation recognized the following net unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses), net realized mark-to-market gains (losses) and total net mark-to-market gains
(losses) (before income taxes) relating to mark-to-market activity on derivative instruments entered into for proprietary trading purposes. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as operating revenue in Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the
tables below,  Change in fair value  represents the change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement  represents the recognized change in fair value that
was reclassified to realized due to settlement of the derivative during the period.         
            Credit Risk (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)              The Registrants would be
exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting
date. For energy-related derivative instruments, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts
payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically,   
         322   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except
where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allow for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds
and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring
model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by credit rating agencies, and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with
Generation as specified in each enabling agreement. Generation s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.   
        The following tables provide information on Generation s credit
exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2013. The tables further delineate that exposure by
credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below do not include credit risk exposure from uranium procurement contracts or exposure through
RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE and Nodal commodity exchanges, further discussed in ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Additionally, the figures in the tables below do not include exposures with affiliates,
including net receivables with ComEd, PECO and BGE of $38 million, $38 million and $27 million, respectively.         

(a)  
  As of December 31, 2013, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $155 million of cash and $29 million of letters of credit .
             ComEd s power procurement contracts
provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are
set at   
         323   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion after
adjusting for any unpaid deliveries and unsecured credit allowed under the contract. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents ComEd s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd s credit exposure to suppliers was
immaterial.            ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of
procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.
           PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the
terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is
determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day
a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure
is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents PECO s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2013, PECO had no net credit exposure with suppliers.   
        PECO is permitted to recover its costs of procuring electric supply
through its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. PECO s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.   
        PECO s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved
annually on a prospective basis by the PAPUC. PECO s counterparty credit risk under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the PGC, which allows PECO to adjust
rates quarterly to reflect realized natural gas prices. PECO does not obtain collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and asset management agreements. As of December 31, 2013, PECO had credit exposure of $9 million under its
natural gas supply and asset management agreements with investment grade suppliers.            BGE is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the MDPSC-approved procurement tariffs. BGE s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through
customer rates. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information.            BGE s full requirement wholesale electric power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a
supplier, or its guarantor, to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from the major credit rating agencies and the
supplier s tangible net worth, subject to an unsecured credit cap. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve
for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. The
unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents BGE s net credit exposure. The seller s credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2013, BGE had no net credit exposure to suppliers.   
         324   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   BGE s regulated gas business is exposed to market-price risk. This market-price risk is
mitigated by BGE s recovery of its costs to procure natural gas through a gas cost adjustment clause approved by the MDPSC. BGE does make off-system sales after BGE has satisfied its customers  demands, which are not covered by the gas
cost adjustment clause. At December 31, 2013, BGE had credit exposure of $14 million related to off-system sales which is mitigated by parental guarantees, letters of credit, or right to offset clauses within other contracts with those
third-party suppliers.              Collateral and
Contingent-Related Features (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, fuels, emissions allowances and other
energy-related products. Certain of Generation s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on exchanges (i.e. NYMEX, ICE). The exchanges act as the
counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation s
credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or
lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets
with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a
function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e. capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best
estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.         
  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully
collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:         

(a)  
  Amount represents the gross fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk-related contingent ignoring the effects of master netting agreements.

(b)  
  Amount represents the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with the same counterparty, which reduces the
amount of any liability for which a Registrant could potentially be required to post collateral.     

(c)  
  Amount represents the net fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features after considering the mitigating effects of
offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be based.              Generation had cash collateral posted of $72 million, letters of credit posted of $364 million, cash collateral held of
$206 million and letters of credit held of $34 million as of December 31, 2013 for counterparties with derivative positions. Generation had cash collateral posted of $527 million and   
         325   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
letters of credit posted of $563 million and cash collateral held of $499 million and letters of credit held of $45 million at December 31, 2012 for counterparties with derivative
positions. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade (i.e. BB+ or Ba1), Generation could be required to post additional collateral of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. These amounts represent the
potential additional collateral required after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.         
  Generation s and Exelon s interest rate swaps contain provisions that, in the event of a merger, if Generation s debt ratings were to
materially weaken, it would be in violation of these provisions, resulting in the ability of the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to maturity. Collateralization would not be required under any circumstance. Termination of the agreement
could result in a settlement payment by Exelon or the counterparty on any interest rate swap in a net liability position. The settlement amount would be equal to the fair value of the swap on the termination date. As of December 31, 2013,
Generation s and Exelon s swaps were in an asset position, with a fair value of $18 million and $21 million, respectively.         
  See Note 24 Segment Information for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.   
        Generation entered into supply forward contracts with certain
utilities, including PECO and BGE, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices
rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded. Under the terms of ComEd s standard block energy contracts, collateral
postings are one-sided from suppliers, including Generation, should exposures between market prices and benchmark prices exceed established unsecured credit limits outlined in the contracts. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd held neither cash nor
letters of credit for the purpose of collateral from suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts. Under the terms of ComEd s annual renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required to cover a fixed value for RECs
only. In addition, under the terms of ComEd s long-term renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required from suppliers for both RECs and energy. The REC portion is a fixed value and the energy portion is one-sided from suppliers
should the forward market prices exceed contract prices. As of December 31, 2013, ComEd held approximately $19 million in the form of cash and letters of credit as margin for both the annual and long-term REC obligations. See Note
1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.            PECO s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon
PECO s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2013, PECO was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements.
If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2013, PECO could have been required to post approximately $42 million of collateral to its counterparties.   
        PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP
Program contracts do not contain provisions that would require PECO to post collateral.            BGE s full requirements wholesale power agreements that govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require BGE to post collateral.   
         326   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   BGE s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require BGE to post
collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon BGE s credit rating from the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by
counterparty. As of December 31, 2013, BGE was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If BGE lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2013, BGE could have been required to post approximately $85
million of collateral to its counterparties.         
     13. Debt and Credit Agreements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Short-Term Borrowings     
        Exelon, ComEd and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements
primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool.   
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE had the following amounts of
commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2013 and 2012:         

(a)  
  Equals aggregate bank commitments under the revolving and bilateral credit agreements (with the exception of a $75 million bilateral agreement) that backstop the commercial paper
program. See discussion below and Credit Agreements table below for items affecting effective program size.           
  In order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each Registrant must have revolving credit
facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. While the amount of its outstanding commercial paper does not reduce available capacity under a Registrant s credit agreement, a Registrant does not issue
commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its credit agreement.   
         327   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   At December 31, 2013, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit
facility borrowings and available capacity under their respective credit agreements:         

(a)  
  Excludes additional credit facility agreements for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE with aggregate commitments of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million and $5 million,
respectively, arranged with minority and community banks located primarily within ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s service territories. These facilities expire on October 17, 2014 and are solely for issuing letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2013, letters of credit issued under these agreements totaled $20 million, $18 million, $21 million and $1 million for Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE, respectively.     

(b)  
  Excludes $75 million bilateral credit facility that does not back Generation s commercial paper program.     
        For the year ended December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings
under the Registrants  credit facilities.            The
following tables present the short-term borrowings activity for Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and BGE during 2013, 2012 and 2011. PECO did not have any short-term borrowings outstanding during 2013, 2012 or 2011.

            Credit Agreements     
        On January 23, 2013, Generation entered into a two year $75
million bilateral letter of credit facility with a bank. The credit agreement expires in January 2015. This facility will solely be utilized by Generation to issue letters of credit.            On March 14, 2013, ComEd extended its unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $1.0
billion. Under this facility, ComEd may issue letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to $500 million. The credit agreement expires on March 28, 2018, and ComEd may request another one-year extension of that term. The credit facility
also allows ComEd to request increases in the aggregate commitments of up to an additional $500 million. Any such extension or increases are subject to the approval of the lenders party to the credit agreement in their sole discretion. Costs
incurred to extend the facility for ComEd were not material.         
  On August 10, 2013, Exelon Corporate, Generation, PECO and BGE amended and extended their respective unsecured syndicated revolving credit
facilities, with aggregate bank commitments of $500 million, $5.3 billion, $600 million and $600 million, respectively. The new covenants are substantially consistent with existing covenants. Costs incurred to amend and extend the facilities for
Exelon Corporate, Generation, PECO and BGE were not material.         
  Effective August 10, 2013, Exelon and ComEd entered into amendments to each of their respective revolving credit facilities (the Amendments).
The Amendments relate to the IRS s challenge to the position taken by Exelon on its 1999 federal income tax return with respect to the sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets in a like-kind exchange tax position. The Amendments are
intended to exclude the non-cash impact of the like-kind exchange tax position from the calculation of the interest coverage ratio under each of Exelon and ComEd s respective credit facilities. See Note 12 Income Taxes for additional
information.            On January 27, 2014 ComEd began the
process of extending its unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility, with aggregate bank commitments of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close and become effective in March 2014, with a maturity of five years from the close of the
transaction. No changes are expected to be made to the facility other than extension of the term for an additional one year period. Generally, it is expected that costs incurred to extend the facility will be amortized over the newly extended life
of the facility.

   Borrowings under Exelon Corporate s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and
BGE s credit agreements bear interest at a rate based upon either the prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate, plus an adder based upon the particular registrant s credit rating. Exelon Corporate, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE have adders of
27.5, 27.5, 27.5, 0.0 and 7.5 basis points for prime based borrowings and 127.5, 127.5, 127.5, 100.0 and 107.5 basis points for LIBOR-based borrowings. The maximum adders for prime rate borrowings and LIBOR-based rate borrowings are 65 basis points
and 165 basis points, respectively. The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments under the agreement. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower.
           An event of default under any of the Registrants 
credit facilities would not constitute an event of default under any of the other Registrants  credit facilities, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in principal amount
in excess of $100 million in the aggregate by Generation under its credit facility would constitute an event of default under the Exelon Corporate credit facility.   
        On October 18, 2013, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE refinanced
their respective minority and community bank credit facility agreements in the amounts of $50 million, $34 million, $34 million and $5 million, respectively. These facilities, which expire in October 2014, are solely utilized to issue letters of
credit.            Each credit facility requires the affected borrower
to maintain a minimum cash from operations to interest expense ratio for the twelve-month period ended on the last day of any quarter. The ratios exclude revenues and interest expenses attributable to securitization debt, certain changes in working
capital, distributions on preferred securities of subsidiaries and, in the case of Exelon and Generation, interest on the debt of its project subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the minimum thresholds reflected in the credit agreements for
the year ended December 31, 2013:         
       
  At December 31, 2013, the interest coverage ratios at the Registrants were as follows:         
            Accounts Receivable Agreement     
        PECO was party to an agreement with a financial institution under
which it transferred an undivided interest, adjusted daily, in its accounts receivable designated under the agreement in exchange for proceeds of $210 million, which was classified as a short-term note payable on Exelon s and PECO s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. The agreement terminated on August 30, 2013 and PECO paid down the outstanding principal of $210 million. The financial institution no longer has an undivided interest in the accounts
receivable designated under the agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the financial institution s undivided interest in Exelon s and PECO s gross accounts receivable was equivalent to $289 million, which represented the financial
institution s interest in PECO s eligible receivables as calculated under the terms of the agreement. The agreement required PECO to maintain eligible receivables at least equivalent to the financial institution s undivided interest.

    Non-Recourse Debt           
  The following are descriptions of activity with respect to certain indebtedness of Exelon s project subsidiaries that is outstanding as of
December 31, 2013. The indebtedness described below is specific to certain generating facilities pledged as collateral with a net book value of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2013, and all associated project financing liabilities
are non-recourse to Exelon and Generation.         
    Continental Wind.      On September 30, 2013, Continental Wind, LLC (Continental Wind), an indirect subsidiary
of Exelon and Generation, completed the issuance and sale of $613 million aggregate principal amount of Continental Wind s 6.00% senior secured notes due February 28, 2033. Continental Wind owns and operates a portfolio of wind farms in
Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas with a total net capacity of 667 MW. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes. In connection with this non-recourse project financing, Exelon terminated
existing interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $350 million during the third quarter of 2013, and realized a total gain of $26 million upon termination. The gain on the interest rate swaps was recorded within OCI and will reduce the
effective interest rate over the life of the debt for Exelon. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on the interest rate swaps.   
        In addition, Continental Wind entered into a $131 million letter of
credit facility and $10 million working capital revolver facility. Continental Wind has issued letters of credit to satisfy certain of its credit support and security obligations. As of December 31, 2013, the Continental Wind letter of credit
facility had $93 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.              ExGen Renewables Energy I LLC.      On February 6, 2014, ExGen Renewables I, LLC (EGR), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, completed the issuance and sale of $300
million aggregate principal amount of EGR s LIBOR plus 425 bps non-recourse senior secured loan, due February 6, 2021. EGR indirectly owns Continental Wind LLC (Continental).              Antelope Valley Project Development Debt Agreement.      The DOE Loan Programs Office
issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a non-recourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility. The project is expected to be
  
         334   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
completed in the first half of 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan are fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of
comparable maturity.            In addition, Generation has issued
letters of credit to support its equity investment in the project. As of December 31, 2013, Generation had $334 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project The letters of credit balance is expected to decline over time as
scheduled equity contributions for the project are made.            In
connection with this agreement, Generation entered into a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of $485 million to mitigate interest-rate risk associated with the financing. As Generation received additional loan advances, it
subsequently entered into a series of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to offset portions of the original interest rate hedge. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps associated
with Antelope Valley.              Sacramento PV
Energy.      In July, 2011, a subsidiary of Generation entered into a $41 million non-recourse project financing for a 30MW solar facility in Sacramento, California. As of December 31, 2013, $37 million was
outstanding. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable rate, payable quarterly, and are secured by equity interests and assets of the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2013, the subsidiary had interest rate swaps with a notional
value of $29 million in order to convert the variable interest payments to fixed payments on 75% of the $41 million facility. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps.   
          Constellation Solar Horizons
Financing.      In September 2012, a subsidiary of Generation entered into an 18-year $38 million non-recourse variable interest note to recover capital used to build a 16 MW solar facility in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Interest
is payable quarterly, and the note is secured by the equity interests and assets of the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2013, $36 million was outstanding. The subsidiary also executed interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $29 million in
order to convert the variable interest payments to fixed payments on 75% of the $38 million facility amount. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding interest rate swaps.   
          Secured Solar Credit Lending
Agreement.      In December 2013, a Generation subsidiary, Constellation Solar, LLC, paid off the remaining balance of the three-year senior secured credit facility that is designed to support the growth of solar operations
in the amount of $94 million and terminated the facility. The facility was scheduled to mature in June of 2014.         
    Other Solar Project Financings.      Generation has the following amounts outstanding under solar project loan
agreements:         

$7 million fully amortizing by June 30, 2031 related to a solar project at the Denver International Airport, and      

$10 million fully amortizing by December 31, 2031 related to a solar project in Holyoke, Massachusetts.      
          Upstream Gas Property Asset-Based Lending Agreement     
        Generation has a five year asset-based lending agreement associated
with certain upstream gas properties that it owns. The borrowing base committed under the facility is $110 million and can increase to a total of $500 million if the assets support a higher borrowing base and Generation is able

to obtain additional commitments from lenders. The facility was amended and extended through January 2019. Borrowings under this facility are secured by the upstream gas properties, and the
lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default. As of December 31, 2013, $77 million was outstanding under the facility with interest payable quarterly. The facility includes a provision that requires the
Generation entities owning the upstream gas properties subject to the agreement to maintain a current ratio of one-to-one. As of December 31, 2013, Generation was in compliance with this provision.   
           14. Income Taxes (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and

    Tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits     
        The following table provides a reconciliation of the Registrants 
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         
 
         339   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

          Included in Exelon s unrecognized
tax benefits balance at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are approximately $1,387 million and $730 million, respectively, of tax positions for which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
such benefits. The disallowance of such positions would not materially affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to, or defer the receipt of the cash tax benefit from, the taxing authority to an earlier or later
period respectively.              Unrecognized tax benefits that
if recognized would affect the effective tax rate           
  Exelon and Generation have $788 million and $768 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 that, if recognized,
would decrease the effective tax rate. Exelon and Generation had $294 million and $263 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate.   
          Reasonably possible that total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits could significantly increase or decrease within 12 months after the reporting date           
   Nuclear Decommissioning Liabilities (Exelon and Generation)    
        AmerGen filed income tax refund claims taking the position that
nuclear decommissioning liabilities assumed as part of its acquisition of nuclear power plants are taken into account in determining the tax basis in the assets it acquired. The additional basis results primarily in reduced capital gains or
increased capital losses on the sale of assets in nonqualified decommissioning funds and increased tax depreciation and amortization deductions. The IRS disagrees with this position and has disallowed the claims. In November 2008, Generation
received a final determination from the Appeals division of the IRS (IRS Appeals) disallowing AmerGen s refund claims. Generation filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims on February 20, 2009 to contest this
determination. During the first and second quarters of 2013, AmerGen and the DOJ completed and filed cross motions for summary judgment. On September 17, 2013, the Court granted the government s motion denying AmerGen s claims for
refund. Exelon is expecting to appeal this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit during 2014.         
  Due to the possibility of final resolution through an appellate decision, Generation continues to believe that it is reasonably possible that the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly decrease in the next twelve months.             Settlement of Income Tax Audits and Litigation             As of December 31, 2013, Exelon and Generation had approximately $256 million of other federal and state unrecognized tax benefits that could significantly increase or decrease within the 12 months
  
         340   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
after the reporting date as a result of completing federal and state audits and expected statute of limitation expirations that if recognized would decrease the effective tax rate. In January
2014, certain of these unrecognized tax benefits were effectively settled and thus will result in reduced tax expense of $33 million at Generation in the first quarter of 2014.   
        See Other Tax Matters Like Kind Exchange section below for
information regarding the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with this matter that could change significantly within the next 12 months.         
    Total amounts of interest and penalties recognized     
        The following table represents the net interest receivable (payable),
including interest related to uncertain tax positions reflected in the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to the merger legacy Constellation recorded interest related to uncertain tax positions as a tax and not interest.
        
          The following table sets forth the net
interest expense, including interest related to uncertain tax positions, recognized in interest expense (income) in other income and deductions in the Registrants  Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Registrants have not accrued any
penalties with respect to uncertain tax positions. Prior to the merger legacy Constellation recorded interest related to uncertain tax positions as a tax and not interest.   
     
            Description of tax years that
remain open to assessment by major jurisdiction           
           Other Tax Matters    
          Like-Kind Exchange     
        Exelon, through its ComEd subsidiary, took a position on its 1999
income tax return to defer approximately $2.8 billion of tax gain on the sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. The gain was deferred by reinvesting the proceeds from the sale in qualifying replacement property under the like-kind exchange
provisions of the IRC. The like-kind exchange replacement property purchased by   
         341   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Exelon included interests in three municipal-owned electric generation facilities which were properly leased back to the municipalities. The IRS disagreed with this position and asserted that the
entire gain of approximately $2.8 billion was taxable in 1999.            Exelon has been unable to reach agreement with the IRS regarding the dispute over the like kind exchange position. The IRS has asserted that the Exelon purchase and leaseback transaction is substantially similar to
a leasing transaction, known as a SILO, which the IRS does not respect as the acquisition of an ownership interest in property. A SILO is a  listed transaction  that the IRS has identified as a potentially abusive tax shelter under
guidance issued in 2005. Accordingly, the IRS has asserted that the sale of the fossil plants followed by the purchase and leaseback of the municipal owned generation facilities does not qualify as a like-kind exchange and the gain on the sale is
fully subject to tax. The IRS has also asserted a penalty of approximately $87 million for a substantial understatement of tax.         
  Exelon disagrees with the IRS and continues to believe that its like-kind exchange transaction is not the same as or substantially similar to a
SILO. Although Exelon has been and remains willing to settle the disagreement on terms commensurate with the hazards of litigation, Exelon does not believe a settlement is possible. Because Exelon believed, as of December 31, 2012, that it was
more-likely-than-not that Exelon would prevail in litigation, Exelon and ComEd had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits with respect to the like-kind exchange position.   
        On January 9, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit reversed the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and reached a decision for the government in Consolidated Edison v. United States. The Court disallowed Consolidated Edison s deductions stemming from its participation in a LILO transaction
that the IRS also has characterized as a tax shelter.            In
accordance with applicable accounting standards, Exelon is required to assess whether it is more-likely-than-not that it will prevail in litigation. Exelon continues to believe that its transaction is not a SILO and that it has a strong case on the
merits. However, in light of the Consolidated Edison decision and Exelon s current determination that settlement is unlikely, Exelon has concluded that subsequent to December 31, 2012, it is no longer more-likely-than-not that its position
will be sustained. As a result, in the first quarter of 2013, Exelon recorded a non-cash charge to earnings of approximately $265 million, which represents the amount of interest expense (after-tax) and incremental state income tax expense for
periods through March 31, 2013 that would be payable in the event that Exelon is unsuccessful in litigation. Of this amount, approximately $170 million was recorded at ComEd. Exelon intends to hold ComEd harmless from any unfavorable impacts of
the after-tax interest amounts on ComEd s equity. As such, ComEd recorded on its consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2013, a $172 million receivable and non-cash equity contributions from Exelon. Exelon and ComEd will continue to
accrue interest on the uncertain tax position, and the charges arising from future interest accruals are not expected to be material to the annual operating earnings of Exelon or ComEd. In addition ComEd will continue to record non-cash equity
contributions from Exelon in the amount of the net after-tax interest charges attributable to ComEd in connection with the like-kind exchange position. Exelon continues to believe that it is unlikely that the $87 million penalty assertion will
ultimately be sustained and therefore no liability for the penalty has been recorded.            On September 30, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued a notice of deficiency to Exelon for the like-kind exchange position. Exelon filed a petition on December 13, 2013 to initiate litigation in the
United States Tax Court. Exelon was not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the issue. The litigation could take three to five years including appeals, if necessary. Decisions in the Tax Court are not
controlled by the Federal Circuit s decision in Consolidated Edison.   
         342

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   As of December 31, 2013, in the event of a fully successful IRS challenge to Exelon s
like-kind exchange position, the potential tax and after-tax interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable may be as much as $840 million, of which approximately $305 million would be attributable to ComEd after consideration
of Exelon s agreement to hold ComEd harmless, and the balance at Exelon. Litigation could take several years such that the estimated cash impacts would likely change by a material amount.              Accounting for Generation Repairs (Exelon and Generation)     
        On April 30, 2013, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2013-24
providing guidance for determining the appropriate tax treatment of costs incurred to repair electric generation assets. Generation expects to change its method of accounting for deducting repairs in accordance with this guidance beginning
with its 2014 tax year. Generation has estimated that adoption of the new method will result in a cash tax detriment of approximately $100 - $120 million.         
    Accounting for Electric Transmission and Distribution Property Repairs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)     
        On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011-43
providing a safe harbor method of tax accounting for repair costs associated with electric transmission and distribution property. ComEd and PECO adopted the safe harbor in the Revenue Procedure for the 2011 and 2010 tax years, respectively. For the
year ended December 31, 2011, the adoption of the safe harbor resulted in a $35 million reduction to income tax expense at PECO, while Generation incurred additional income tax expense in the amount of $28 million due to a decrease in its
domestic production activities deduction, which are reflected in the effective income tax rate reconciliation above in the plant basis differences and domestic production activities deduction lines, respectively. For Exelon, the adoption had a
minimal effect on consolidated earnings. In addition, the adoption of the safe harbor resulted in a cash tax benefit at Exelon, ComEd and PECO in the amount of approximately $300 million, $250 million, $95 million respectively, partially offset by a
cash tax detriment at Generation in the amount of $28 million related to a decreased domestic production activities deduction.         
  BGE adopted the safe harbor for the short period 2012 pre-merger tax year. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the adoption of the safe
harbor resulted in a cash tax benefit at BGE in the amount of $27 million.            See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for discussion of the regulatory treatment prescribed in the 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement for PECO s cash tax benefit resulting from the application of the
method change to years prior to 2010.              Accounting for
Gas Distribution Property Repairs (Exelon, PECO and BGE).              In September 2012, PECO filed an application with the IRS to change its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2011 tax year. The change to the newly adopted method for the 2011 tax year and
2012 resulted in a tax benefit of $26 million at Exelon, of which $29 million in tax benefit is recorded at PECO, partially offset by an expense recorded at Generation to reflect a reduction in its domestic production activities deduction. BGE
changed its method of accounting for gas distribution repairs for the 2008 tax year. The IRS is expected to issue industry guidance in the near future. Exelon, PECO and BGE will then determine the financial statement impacts of the gas distribution
repair costs accounting method changes after guidance is issued.

     Accounting for Final Tangible Property Regulations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, and
BGE)              On September 19, 2013, the Treasury
Department and the IRS published final regulations regarding the tax treatment of costs incurred to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. The Registrants have assessed the financial impact of this guidance and do not expect it to have
a material impact. Any changes in method of accounting required to conform to the final regulations will be made for the Registrant s 2014 taxable year.  
          2011 Illinois State Tax Rate Legislation (Exelon, Generation and
ComEd)              The Taxpayer Accountability and Budget
Stabilization Act, (SB 2505), enacted into law in Illinois on January 13, 2011, increases the corporate tax rate in Illinois from 7.3% to 9.5% for tax years 2011 2014, provides for a reduction in the rate from 9.5% to 7.75% for tax years
2015 2024 and further reduces the rate from 7.75% to 7.3% for tax years 2025 and thereafter. Pursuant to the rate change, Exelon re-evaluated its deferred state income taxes during the first quarter of 2011. Illinois  corporate income tax
rate changes resulted in a charge to state deferred taxes (net of Federal taxes) during the first quarter of 2011 of $7 million, $11 million and $4 million for Exelon, Generation and ComEd, respectively. Exelon s and ComEd s charge is net
of a regulatory asset of $15 million.            In 2011, the income
tax rate change increased Exelon s Illinois income tax provision (net of Federal taxes) by approximately $7 million, of which $12 million and $5 million of additional tax relates to Exelon Corporate and Generation, respectively, and a $10
million benefit for ComEd. The 2011 tax benefit at ComEd reflects the impact of a 2011 tax net operating loss generated primarily by the bonus depreciation deduction allowed under the Tax Relief Act of 2010 and the electric transmission and
distribution property repairs deduction discussed below.         
    Long-Term State Tax Apportionment (Exelon and Generation)     
        Exelon and Generation periodically review events that may
significantly impact how income is apportioned among the states and, therefore, the calculation of Exelon s and Generation s deferred state income taxes. In 2011 as a result of the 2011 Illinois State Tax Rate Legislation discussed above,
Exelon and Generation re-evaluated their long-term state tax apportionment for Illinois and all other states where they have state income tax obligations, resulting in recording a deferred state tax expense during the first quarter of 2011 of $22
million and $11 million (net of Federal taxes) for Exelon and Generation, respectively. The long-term state tax apportionment also was revised in the fourth quarter of 2011 pursuant to long-term state tax apportionment policy, resulting in recording
an additional deferred state tax expense of $1 million and a deferred state tax benefit of $8 million (net of Federal taxes) for Exelon and Generation, respectively.   
        As a result of the merger with Constellation, Exelon and Generation
re-evaluated their long-term state tax apportionment in the first quarter of 2012. The total effect of revising the long-term state tax apportionment resulted in the recording of a deferred state tax asset of $72 million (net of Federal taxes) for
Exelon. Of this, a benefit in the amount of $116 million and $14 million (net of Federal taxes) was recorded for Exelon and Generation, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Further, Exelon and Generation recorded deferred
state tax liabilities of $44 million and $14 million (net of Federal taxes), respectively, as part of purchase accounting during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The long-term state tax apportionment also was updated in the fourth quarter
of 2012, resulting in the recording of a deferred state tax benefit of $3 million (net of Federal taxes) for Exelon, and a deferred state tax expense of $7 million (net of Federal taxes) for Generation. There was no change to the long-term state tax
apportionment for BGE, ComEd and PECO.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The long-term state tax apportionment was revised in the fourth quarter of 2013 pursuant to its
long-term state tax apportionment policy, resulting in the recording of amounts that are immaterial for Exelon and Generation, respectively.         
    Allocation of Tax Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE are all party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides
for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to
tax. In addition, any net benefit attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit. During 2013, Generation and PECO recorded an allocation
of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $26 million and $27 million, respectively. During 2013, ComEd and BGE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result
of ComEd s and BGE s 2013 tax net operating loss generated primarily by the bonus depreciation deduction allowed under the Tax Relief Act of 2010. During 2012, Generation and PECO recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon
under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $48 million and $9 million, respectively. During 2012, ComEd and BGE did not record an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of ComEd s and BGE s 2012
tax net operating loss generated primarily by the bonus depreciation deduction allowed under the Tax Relief Act of 2010.         
  ComEd received a non-cash contribution to equity from Exelon in 2012 of $11, related to tax benefits associated with capital projects constructed by
ComEd on behalf of Exelon and Generation.         
     15. Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
          Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations     
        Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power
plants following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted
cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and
discount rates. Generation generally updates its ARO annually during the third quarter, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and
probabilities assigned to various scenarios.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013:         

(a)  
  Includes $9 million and $10 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities on
Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.              During 2013, Generation s ARO increased by approximately $114 million. The increase is largely driven by an increase in the estimated costs to decommission the Limerick and Three Mile Island nuclear units
resulting from the completion of updated decommissioning costs studies received during 2013 and an increase for accretion of the obligation. These increases in the ARO were offset by decreases to the ARO due to changes in long-term escalation rates,
primarily for labor and energy costs, as well as changes in the timing of the future nominal cash flows coupled with the fact that cash flows affected by this change in timing are re-measured and discounted at current credit adjusted risk free rates
(CARFRs), which have increased from the prior year. The decrease in the ARO due to the changes in, and timing of, estimated cash flows were entirely offset by decreases in Property, plant and equipment within Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.            During 2012, Generation s
ARO increased by $1,061 million. The increase in the ARO was largely driven by four factors: i) changes in the timing of the future nominal cash flows resulting from an assumed five year deferral to 2025 of the acceptance date of spent nuclear fuel
by the DOE coupled with the fact that; ii) cash flows affected by this change in timing are re-measured and discounted at current CARFRs, which had dramatically decreased given the lower interest rate environment; iii) an increase in the estimated
costs to decommission the Quad Cities, Dresden and Clinton nuclear units resulting from the completion of updated decommissioning costs studies received during 2012; and iv) accretion of the obligation. The increase in the ARO due to the changes in,
and timing of, estimated cash flows resulted in $10 million of expense, which is included in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.              Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments              NDT funds have been established for each generating station unit to satisfy Generation s nuclear decommissioning
obligations. Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.         
  The NDT funds associated with the former ComEd, former PECO and former AmerGen units have been funded with amounts collected from ComEd customers,
PECO customers and the previous owners of the former AmerGen plants, respectively. Based on an ICC order, ComEd ceased collecting amounts from its customers to pay for decommissioning costs. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in
  
         346   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of the plants. The amounts collected from
PECO customers are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects PECO s calculations of the estimated amount
needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs. The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO customers. The most recent rate adjustment occurred on
January 1, 2013, and the effective rates currently yield annual collections of approximately $24 million. The next five-year adjustment is expected to be reflected in rates charged to PECO customers effective January 1, 2018. With respect
to the former AmerGen units, Generation does not collect any amounts, nor is there any mechanism by which Generation can seek to collect additional amounts, from customers. Apart from the contributions made to the NDT funds from amounts collected
from ComEd and PECO customers, Generation has not made contributions to the NDT funds.            Any shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required to be funded by Generation, with the exception of a shortfall for the current
decommissioning activities at Zion Station, where certain decommissioning activities have been transferred to a third-party (see Zion Station Decommissioning below). Generation has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers related
to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC. Generally, PECO, and likewise Generation will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first
$50 million of any shortfall of trust funds, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units, compared to decommissioning obligations, as well as 5% of any additional shortfalls. The initial $50 million and up to 5% of any additional shortfalls
would be borne by Generation. No recourse exists to collect additional amounts from ComEd customers for the former ComEd units or from the previous owners of the former AmerGen units. With respect to the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds
remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd s or PECO s customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO
units. With respect to the former AmerGen units, Generation retains any funds remaining in the funds after decommissioning.         
  During 2012, the NDT fixed income portfolio completed its transition from solely core fixed income investments to a blend of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities (TIPS), investment-grade corporate credit and middle market lending. There was no change in the equity investment strategy. At December 31, 2013, approximately 48% of the funds were invested in equity securities and 52%
were invested in fixed income securities. At December 31, 2012, approximately 47% of the funds were invested in equity securities and 53% were invested in fixed income securities.            At December 31, 2013, and 2012, Exelon and Generation had NDT fund investments totaling $8,071 million and $7,248
million, respectively.            The following table provides
unrealized gains (losses) on NDT funds for 2013, 2012 and 2011:         
 
         347   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(a)  
  Net unrealized gains (losses) related to Generation s NDT funds associated with Regulatory Agreement Units are included in Regulatory liabilities on Exelon s
Consolidated Balance Sheets and Noncurrent payables to affiliates on Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(b)  
  Excludes $7 million, $73 million and $48 million of net unrealized gains related to the Zion Station pledged assets in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Net unrealized gains
related to Zion Station pledged assets are included in the Payable for Zion Station decommissioning on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.     

(c)  
  Net unrealized gains (losses) related to Generation s NDT funds with Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are included within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.              Interest and dividends on NDT fund investments are recognized when earned and are included in Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Interest and dividends earned on the NDT fund investments for the Regulatory Agreement Units are eliminated within Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   
         Accounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreements with ComEd and
PECO . Based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC that dictates Generation s obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis, as long as funds
held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are
generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and
corresponding regulatory liability. Should the expected value of the NDT fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the adverse
impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material. As of December 31, 2013, the NDT funds of each of the former ComEd units are expected to exceed the related decommissioning obligation
for each of the units. For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is different, as described below, from the calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines.
           Based on the regulatory agreement supported by the PAPUC
that dictates Generation s rights and obligations related to the shortfall or excess of trust funds necessary for decommissioning the seven former PECO nuclear units, regardless of whether the funds held in the NDT funds are expected to exceed
or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset of
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at
Exelon. Likewise, PECO has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and a corresponding regulatory liability. Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon s and Generation s ability to offset
decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The decommissioning-related activities related to the Clinton, Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island
nuclear plants (the former AmerGen units) and the portions of the Peach Bottom nuclear plants that are not subject to regulatory agreements with respect to the NDT funds are reflected in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income, as there are no regulatory agreements associated with these units.         
  Refer to Note 3 Regulatory Matters and Note 25 Related Party Transactions for information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and
PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund to customers any decommissioning-related assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.   
          Zion Station Decommissioning     
        On September 1, 2010, Generation completed an Asset Sale
Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion,
Illinois and ceased operation in 1998. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for
Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities, excluding the obligation to dispose of SNF, associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions will periodically request
reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. During 2013, EnergySolutions entered a definitive acquisition agreement and was acquired by another Company. Generation
reviewed the acquisition as it relates to the ASA to decommission Zion Station. Based on that review, Generation determined that the acquisition will not adversely impact decommissioning activities under the ASA.   
        On July 14, 2011, three people filed a purported class action
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois naming ZionSolutions and Bank of New York Mellon as defendants and seeking, among other things, an accounting for use of NDT funds, an injunction against the use of
NDT funds, the appointment of a trustee for the NDT funds, and the return of NDT funds to customers of ComEd to the extent legally entitled thereto. On July 20, 2012, ZionSolutions and Bank of New York Mellon filed a motion to dismiss the
amended complaint for failing to state a claim. On July 29, 2013, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the amended complaint. On August 26, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On January 31, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal.   
        ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to
request reimbursements from the Zion Station NDT funds as defined within the ASA. Therefore, the transfer of the Zion Station assets did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and, as a result, the related NDT funds were reclassified to
pledged assets for Zion Station decommissioning within Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be measured in the same manner as prior to the completion of the transaction. Additionally, the transferred
ARO for decommissioning was replaced with a payable to ZionSolutions in Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the value of the Zion Station NDT assets, net of applicable taxes, will be recorded as a change in
the payable to ZionSolutions. At no point will the payable to ZionSolutions exceed the project budget of the costs remaining to decommission Zion Station. Generation has retained its obligation to the SNF following ZionSolutions completion of its
contractual obligations, to transfer the SNF at Zion Station to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF   
         349

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
storage facility. Generation has a liability of approximately $82 million, which is included within the nuclear decommissioning ARO at December 31, 2013. Generation also has retained NDT
assets to fund its obligation to maintain and transfer the SNF at Zion Station and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF storage facility. Any shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF
storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. Any Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning activities will be returned to ComEd customers in accordance with the applicable orders. The
following table provides the pledged assets and payable to ZionSolutions, and withdrawals by ZionSolutions at December 31, 2013 and 2012:         

(a)  
  Excludes a liability recorded within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the tax obligation on the unrealized activity associated with the
Zion Station NDT Funds. The NDT Funds will be utilized to satisfy the tax obligations as gains and losses are realized.     

(b)  
  Included in Other current liabilities within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.     
       
  ZionSolutions leased the land associated with Zion Station from Generation pursuant to a Lease Agreement. Under the Lease Agreement, ZionSolutions
has committed to complete the required decommissioning work according to an established schedule and will construct a dry cask storage facility on the land for the SNF currently held in SNF pools at Zion Station. Rent payable under the Lease
Agreement is $1.00 per year, although the Lease Agreement requires ZionSolutions to pay property taxes associated with Zion Station and penalty rents may accrue if there are unexcused delays in the progress of decommissioning work at Zion Station or
the construction of the dry cask SNF storage facility. To reduce the risk of default by EnergySolutions or ZionSolutions, EnergySolutions provided a $200 million letter of credit to be used to fund decommissioning costs in the event the NDT assets
are insufficient. EnergySolutions has also provided a performance guarantee and entered into other agreements that will provide rights and remedies for Generation and the NRC in the case of other specified events of default, including a special
purpose easement for disposal capacity at the EnergySolutions site in Clive, Utah, for all LLRW volume of Zion Station.         
   NRC Minimum Funding Requirements . NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance
that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as calculated using the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded on Generation s and
Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs, and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license
renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under
the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires either further funding or other financial guarantees.            Key assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2013 include: (1) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit;
(2) the option on a unit-by-unit basis to use generic, non-site specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease
  
         350   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals and with an assumed end-of-operations date of 2019
for Oyster Creek); (5) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual after-tax returns on the
NDT funds of 2% (3% for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).            In contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at December 31, 2013 include: (1) the use of site specific cost
estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units,
on-site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance, and disposal of certain low-level radioactive waste); (3) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning activities are
completed under three possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations; (4) the assumption plants cease operating at the end of an extended license life (assuming 20-year license renewal extensions, except
Oyster Creek with an assumed end-of-operations date of 2019); (5) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately 5% through a period of
approximately 30 years after the end of the extended lives of the units; and (6) an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return on the NDT funds of 5.9% to 6.7% (as compared to a historical 5-year annual average pre-tax return of approximately
11.7%).            Generation is required to provide to the NRC a
biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels.
Depending on the value of the trust funds, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or make additional contributions to the trusts, which could be
significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Exelon s and Generation s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected.   
        On April 1, 2013, Generation submitted its NRC-required biennial
decommissioning funding status report as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, Generation provided adequate funding assurance for all of its units, including Limerick Unit 1, where Generation has in place a $115 million
parent guarantee to cover the NRC minimum funding assurance requirements. On October 2, 2013, the NRC issued summary findings from the NRC Staff s review of the 2013 decommissioning funding status reports for all 104 operating reactors,
including the Generation operating units. Based on that review, the NRC Staff determined that Generation provided decommissioning funding assurance under the NRC regulations for all of its operating units, including Limerick Unit 1.   
        On January 31, 2013, Generation received a letter from the NRC
indicating that the NRC has identified potential  apparent violations  of its regulations because of alleged inaccuracies in the Decommissioning Funding Status reports for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. The NRC asserted that Generation s
status reports deliberately reflected cost estimates for decommissioning its nuclear plants that were less than what the NRC says are the minimum amounts required by NRC regulations. Generation met with the NRC on April 30, 2013 for a
pre-decisional enforcement conference to provide additional information to explain why Generation believes that it complied with the regulatory requirements and did not deliberately or otherwise provide incomplete or inaccurate information in its

Generation s current funding status, and as reflected in Generation s April 1, 2013 decommissioning funding status report referenced above, Generation continues to provide adequate
funding assurance for each of its units. In the normal course of NRC review, Generation has received a series of data requests that are unrelated to the potential apparent violations and the pre-decisional enforcement conference. Generation
continues to cooperate with the NRC and provide the requested information. Generation does not have a definite date on which it will receive a response from the NRC.   
        In addition, on June 24, 2013, Exelon received a subpoena from the
SEC requesting that Exelon provide the SEC with certain documents generally relating to Exelon and Generation s reporting and funding of the future decommissioning of Exelon s nuclear power plants. Exelon and Generation are cooperating
with the SEC and providing the requested documents.            As the
future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation s units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be
collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.   
         Non-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)
            Generation has AROs for plant closure costs associated
with its fossil and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations and other
decommissioning-related activities. ComEd, PECO and BGE have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional
information on the Registrants  accounting policy for AROs.            The following table provides a rollforward of the non-nuclear AROs reflected on the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013:   

(a)  
  During the year ended December 31, 2013, Generation recorded an increase in operating and maintenance expense of $13 million. ComEd and PECO did not record any adjustments
in operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, Generation recorded a reduction in operating and maintenance expense of $8 million. ComEd, PECO, and BGE did not record any
reductions in operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Exelon s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended to be tax-qualified defined
benefit plans. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented
employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated under the IRC as qualified trusts. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts,
subject to certain IRC limitations.              Benefit Obligations, Plan Assets
and Funded Status              Exelon recognizes the overfunded
or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and regulatory assets (liabilities), in
accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance. The measurement date for the plans is December 31.         
  During the first quarter of 2013, Exelon received an updated valuation of its legacy pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to reflect
actual census data as of January 1, 2013. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $8 million and a decrease to the other postretirement benefit obligation of $39 million. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive
loss decreased by approximately $75 million (after tax) and regulatory assets increased by approximately $93 million. During the second quarter of 2013, Exelon received the updated valuation for the legacy Constellation pension and other
postretirement obligations to reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2013. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension obligation of $23 million and a decrease to the other postretirement benefit obligation of $12 million.
Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $2 million (after tax) and regulatory assets increased by approximately $14 million.   
        The following table provides a rollforward of the changes in the
benefit obligations and plan assets for the most recent two years for all plans combined:

  Represents cash settlements only.     

(b)  
  Exelon s other postretirement benefits paid for the year ended December 31, 2012 are net of $1.3 million of reinsurance proceeds received from the Department of Health
and Human Services as part of the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program pursuant to the Affordable Care Act of 2010. In 2013, the Program was no longer accepting applications for reimbursement.     
        Exelon presents its benefit obligations and plan assets net on its
balance sheet within the following line items:         
          The funded status of the pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations refers to the difference between plan assets and estimated obligations of the plan. The funded status changes over time due to several factors, including contribution levels, assumed discount rates and actual
returns on plan assets.            The following tables provide the
projected benefit obligations (PBO), accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with a PBO or ABO in excess of plan assets.   

355   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   On a PBO basis, the plans were funded at 88% at December 31, 2013 compared to 80% at
December 31, 2012. On an ABO basis, the plans were funded at 93% at December 31, 2013 compared to 85% at December 31, 2012. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO includes no assumption about future compensation levels.
             Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs     
        The following table presents the components of Exelon s net
periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The table reflects an increase in 2012 and a reduction in 2011 of net periodic postretirement benefit costs of approximately $(17) million and $28 million,
respectively, related to a Federal subsidy provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Modernization Act), discussed further below.            The 2013 pension benefit cost for all plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
7.50% and a discount rate of 3.92%. Certain plans were remeasured during the year using a discount rate of 4.21%. The 2013 other postretirement benefit cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.45% for funded
plans and a discount rate of 4.00% for all plans. Certain plans were remeasured during the year using a discount rate of 4.66%. Certain other postretirement benefit plans are not funded. A portion of the net periodic benefit cost is capitalized
within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.         

(a)  
  ComEd and BGE established regulatory assets of $1 million and $4 million, respectively, for their portion of the contractual termination benefit charge in 2012.
             Through Exelon s postretirement benefit
plans, the Registrants provide retirees with prescription drug coverage. The Medicare Modernization Act, enacted on December 8, 2003, introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Management believes the prescription drug benefit provided under Exelon s postretirement benefit plans meets the
requirements for the subsidy. In December 2011, the Company decided that beginning in 2013, it will no longer elect to take the direct Part D subsidy. Beginning in 2013, eligible employees are offered an Employee Group Waiver Plan, a Medicare Part D
Plan, with a supplemental  wrap  that closely matches the current prescription drug plan design. See the  Health

 Care Reform Legislation  section below for further discussion regarding the income tax treatment of Federal subsidies of prescription drug benefits.   
        The effect of the subsidy on the components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 included in the consolidated financial statements was as follows:         
            Components of AOCI and Regulatory Assets
             Under the authoritative guidance for regulatory
accounting, a portion of current year actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized within Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be
recorded to AOCI. The following tables provide the components of AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 for all plans combined.         

(a)  
  Of the $1,753 million gain related to pension benefits, $1,071 million and $682 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2013. Of the $677
million gain related to other postretirement benefits, $352 million and $325 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities), respectively, during 2013. Of the $1,188 million loss related to pension benefits, $283 million and
$904 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2012. Of the $120 million loss related to other postretirement benefits, $39 million and $81 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during
2012. Of the $399 million loss related to pension benefits, $181 million and $218 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2011. Of the $37 million loss related to other postretirement benefits, $13 million and $24
million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2011.     
         357

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   The following table provides the components of Exelon s gross accumulated other comprehensive
loss and regulatory assets (liabilities) that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for all plans combined:         
     
          The
following table provides the components of Exelon s AOCI and regulatory assets at December 31, 2013 (included in the table above) that are expected to be amortized as components of periodic benefit cost in 2014. These estimates are subject
to the completion of an actuarial valuation of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which will reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2014 and actual claims activity as of December 31, 2013. The
valuation is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014 for legacy Exelon plans and in the second quarter of 2014 for legacy Constellation plans.         

Assumptions              The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit and other
postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The
measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the
plans, the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees participating in cash balance plans and the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs. Additionally, assumptions related to plan participants include the incidence of
mortality, the expected remaining service period, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age and length of service, among other factors.   
         358   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Expected Rate of Return.  In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, Exelon
considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon s target asset class allocations.
           The following assumptions were used to determine the
benefit obligations for all of the plans at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year s net periodic benefit costs.   

The following assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for all the plans for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012
and 2011:

(a)  
  The discount rates above represent the initial discount rates used to establish Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefits costs for the year ended December 31,
2013. Certain of the benefit plans were remeasured during the year using discount rates of 4.21% and 4.66% for pension and other postretirement benefits, respectively. Costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect the impact of these
remeasurements.     

(b)  
  The discount rates above represent the initial discounts rates used to establish Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefits costs for 2012. Certain of the benefit
plans were remeasured during the year due to the Constellation merger, plan settlement and curtailment events, and plan changes using discount rates of 3.71% and 3.72% for pension and other postretirement benefits, respectively. Costs for the year
ended December 31, 2012 reflect the impact of these remeasurements.

            Health Care Reform Legislation
             In March 2010, the Health Care Reform Acts were
signed into law, which contain a number of provisions that impact retiree health care plans provided by employers. One such provision reduces the deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree health care costs to the extent an
employer s postretirement health care plan receives Federal subsidies that provide retiree prescription drug benefits at least equivalent to those offered by Medicare. Although this change did not take effect immediately, the Registrants were
required to recognize the full accounting impact in their financial statements in the period in which the legislation was enacted. As a result, in the first quarter of 2010, Exelon recorded total after-tax charges of approximately $65 million to
income tax expense to reverse deferred tax assets previously established. Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE recorded charges of $24 million, $11 million, $9 million and $3 million, respectively. Additionally, as a result of this deductibility change
for employers and other Health Care Reform provisions that impact the federal prescription drug subsidy options provided to employers, Exelon has made a change in the manner in which it will receive prescription drug subsidies beginning in 2013.
           Additionally, the Health Care Reform Acts also include a
provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans beginning in 2018, whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate. Although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2018, accounting guidance
requires Exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise tax in its annual actuarial valuation. The application of the legislation is still unclear and Exelon continues to monitor the Department of Labor and IRS for additional guidance.
Certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation, including projected inflation rates (based on the CPI) and whether pre- and post-65 retiree populations can be
aggregated in determining the premium values of health care benefits. Exelon reflected its best estimate of the expected impact in its annual actuarial valuation.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
     Contributions     
        The following table provides contributions made by Generation, ComEd,
PECO, BGE and BSC to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:         

(a)  
  The Registrants present the cash contributions above net of Federal subsidy payments received on each of their respective Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE received Federal subsidy payments of $10 million, $5 million, $4 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2012, and $11 million, $5 million, $4 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, in 2011.
Effective January 1, 2013, Exelon is no longer receiving this subsidy.     

(b)  
  BGE s pension benefit contributions for 2012 and 2011 exclude $0 million and $54 million, respectively, of pension contributions made by BGE prior to the closing of
Exelon s merger with Constellation on March 12, 2012. BGE s other postretirement benefit payments for 2012 and 2011 exclude $4 million and $13 million, respectively, of other postretirement benefit payments made by BGE prior to the
closing of Exelon s merger with Constellation on March 12, 2012. These pre-merger contributions are not included in Exelon s financial statements but are reflected in BGE s financial statements.     

(c)  
  The increase in 2011 pension contributions was related to Exelon s $2.1 billion contribution to its pension plans as a result of accelerated cash benefits associated with
the Tax Relief Act of 2010.              Exelon plans to
contribute $264 million to its qualified pension plans in 2014, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE will contribute $118 million, $119 million, $11 million and $0 million, respectively. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon s
non-qualified pension plans are not funded. Exelon plans to make non-qualified pension plan benefit payments of $12 million in 2014, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE will make payments of $5 million, $1 million, $0 million and $1 million,
respectively. Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as
defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums
or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). Additionally, for Exelon s largest qualified pension plan, the projected contributions reflect a
funding strategy of contributing the greater of $250 million, which approximates service cost, or the minimum amounts under ERISA to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future
period required pension contributions. On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the Twenty-first Century Act, which contains a pension funding provision that results in lower minimum pension
contributions in the near term while increasing the premiums pension plans pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Certain provisions of the law were applied in 2012 while others were applied in 2013. The estimated impacts of the law are
reflected in the projected pension contributions.            Unlike
the qualified pension plans, other postretirement plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. Exelon s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its other
postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and   
         361   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
best assure continued rate recovery). In 2014, Exelon anticipates funding its other postretirement benefit plans based on the funding considerations discussed above, with the exception of those
plans which remain unfunded. Exelon expects to make other postretirement benefit plan contributions, including benefit payments related to unfunded plans, of approximately $430 million in 2014, of which Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE expect to
contribute $168 million, $197 million, $19 million, and $17 million, respectively.              Estimated Future Benefit Payments              Estimated future benefit payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2013 were:   
     
            Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries
             Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE account for their
participation in Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying multiemployer accounting. Employee-related assets and liabilities, including both pension and postretirement liabilities, for the legacy Exelon plans were
allocated by Exelon to its subsidiaries based on the number of active employees as of January 1, 2001 as part of Exelon s corporate restructuring. Exelon allocates the components of pension and other postretirement costs to the
subsidiaries in the legacy Exelon plans based upon several factors, including the measures of active employee participation in each participating unit. The obligation for Generation, ComEd and PECO reflects the initial allocation and the cumulative
costs incurred and contributions made since January 1, 2001. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions are allocated to legacy Exelon subsidiaries in proportion to active service costs recognized and total costs recognized, respectively.
For legacy CEG plans, components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and contributions are allocated to the subsidiaries based on employee participation (both active and retired).   
        The amounts below were included in capital expenditures and operating
and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s, BSC s and BGE s allocated portion of the pension and postretirement benefit plan costs.
These amounts include the recognized contractual termination benefit charges, curtailment gains, and settlement charges:         
 
         362   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(a)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO or
BGE amounts above. As of December 31, 2012, ComEd and BGE each reported a regulatory asset of $1 million related to their BSC-billed portion of the second quarter 2012 contractual termination benefit charge.     

(b)  
  The amounts included in capital and operating and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include $12 million and $51 million, respectively, in
costs incurred prior to the closing of Exelon s merger with Constellation on March 12, 2012. These amounts are not included in Exelon s capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2011.     

(c)  
  BGE s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 include a $3 million contractual termination benefit charge, which was
recorded as a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2012.           
    Plan Assets           
   Investment Strategy.  On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan
benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.         
  Exelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its
pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns
that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans  liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon s other postretirement plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that
prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.            Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.59% to estimate its 2014 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.         
  Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan target asset allocations and December 31, 2013 and 2012 asset allocations were as

         Concentrations of Credit Risk.  Exelon evaluated its pension and
other postretirement benefit plans  asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2013. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment
concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2013, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10 percent of plan assets) of risk in Exelon s pension
and other postretirement benefit plan assets.              Fair Value Measurements
             The following table presents Exelon s pension
and other postretirement benefit plan assets measured and recorded at fair value on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2013 and 2012:

(b)  
  As of December 31, 2012, hedge fund investments that contained redemption restrictions limiting Exelon s ability to redeem the investments within a reasonable period of
time were classified as Level 3 investments. As of December 31, 2013, restrictions for certain investments no longer applied, therefore allowing redemption within a reasonable period of time from the measurement date at NAV. As such, these
hedge fund investments are reflected as transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 of $627 million in 2013.     

(c)  
  In connection with the acquisition of Constellation in March 2012, Exelon assumed Constellation s pension plan assets resulting in transfers into Level 3 of $141 million.

(d)  
  In 2012, Exelon refined its policy over the criteria that hedge fund investments must meet in order to be categorized within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Therefore, certain hedge fund investments that were categorized within Level 3 in prior periods have been re-categorized as Level 2 investments as of December 31, 2012. The re-categorization of these hedge fund investments is reflected as
transfers out of Level 3 of $1.1 billion.     

(e)  
  In 2012, the liquidity terms of a certain real estate investment changed to allow redemption within a reasonable period of time from the redemption date which led to a transfer
out of Level 3 to Level 2 of $5 million.               Valuation
Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value              Cash
equivalents . Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short term fixed income securities and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market
prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.             Equity securities . With respect to individually held equity securities, including investments in U.S. and international securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained
from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity   
         369   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
securities held individually are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities, due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. Equity securities
are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.
           Equity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by
investment companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which
are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the
net asset value per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. These funds have been categorized as Level 2.         
   Fixed income . For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, municipal
bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for
unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source
of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature
and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been
categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are
typically illiquid. The fair values of fixed income securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities and privately placed fixed income securities, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade
information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2.         
  Derivative instruments consisting primarily of interest rate swaps to manage risk are recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments are valued
based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.            Fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, including short-term investment funds, are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which
are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized
as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the net asset value per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying
securities. These funds have been categorized as Level 2.         
   Private equity . Private equity investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly
traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. Private   
         370   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows
and market based comparable data. Since these valuation inputs are not highly observable, private equity investments have been categorized as Level 3.         
   Hedge funds . Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns
and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or ownership interest of the investments. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which
may include a lock-up period or a gate. For Exelon s investments that have terms that allow redemption within a reasonable period of time from the measurement date, the hedge fund investments are categorized as Level 2. For investments that
have restrictions that may limit Exelon s ability to redeem the investments at the measurement date or within a reasonable period of time, the hedge fund investments are categorized as Level 3.   
         Real estate . Real estate investment trusts valued daily based on
quoted prices in active markets are categorized as Level 1. Real estate commingled funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s
overall investment strategy. Since these funds are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the net asset value per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. These funds have
been categorized as Level 2. Other real estate funds are funds with a direct investment in a pool of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals from
sources with professional qualifications. Since these valuation inputs are not highly observable, these real estate funds have been categorized as Level 3.         
   Defined Contribution Savings Plan (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)    
        The Registrants participate in various 401(k) defined contribution
savings plans that are sponsored by Exelon. The plans are qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage
of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents matching contributions to the savings plan for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         

(b)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These costs are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO, or
BGE amounts above.                 17.
Severance (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE)          
  The Registrants have an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer an employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of
severance benefits. The Registrants record a liability and expense or regulatory asset for severance once terminations are probable of occurrence   
         371   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
and the related severance benefits can be reasonably estimated. For severance benefits that are incremental to its ongoing severance plan ( one-time termination benefits ), the
Registrants measure the obligation and record the expense at fair value at the communication date if there are no future service requirements, or, if future service is required to receive the termination benefit, ratably over the required service
period.              Merger-Related Severance     
        Upon closing the merger with Constellation, Exelon recorded a
severance accrual for the anticipated employee position reductions as a result of the post-merger integration. The majority of these positions are corporate and Generation support positions. Since then, Exelon has identified specific employees to be
severed pursuant to the merger-related staffing and selection process as well as employees that were previously identified for severance but have since accepted another position within Exelon and are no longer receiving a severance benefit. Exelon
adjusts its accrual each quarter to reflect its best estimate of remaining severance costs. In addition, certain employees identified during the staffing and selection process also receive pension and other postretirement benefits that are deemed
contractual termination benefits, which the Registrants recorded during the second quarter of 2012.            The amount of severance expense associated with the post-merger integration recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013 for Exelon and Generation was $6 million and $6 million, respectively. For
Generation, $5 million represents amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations. There was no severance expense associated with post-merger integration recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013 for ComEd, PECO and BGE. Estimated
costs to be incurred after December 31, 2013 are not material.            For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Registrants recorded the following severance benefit costs associated with the identified job reductions within operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated
Statements of Operations, except for those costs that were capitalized as regulatory assets related to ComEd and BGE:         

(a)  
  The amounts above include $46 million at Generation, $14 million at ComEd, $7 million at PECO, and $7 million at BGE, for amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations
for the year ended December 31, 2012.     

(b)  
  Exelon, ComEd and BGE established regulatory assets of $35 million, $16 million and $19 million, respectively, for severance benefits costs for the year ended December 31,
2012. The majority of these costs are expected to be recovered over a five-year period.     
         372

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Amounts included in the table below represent the severance liability recorded by Exelon,
Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE for employees of those Registrants and exclude amounts billed through intercompany allocations:         

(a)  
  Includes salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits. Amounts primarily represent benefits provided for under Exelon s ongoing severance plan. One-time
termination benefits were not material for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.     

(b)  
  Primarily includes life insurance, employer payroll taxes, educational assistance, and outplacement services.     
        Cash payments under the plan began in the second quarter of 2012.
Substantially all cash payments under the plan are expected to be made by the end of 2016.              Ongoing Severance Plans              The Registrants provide severance and health and welfare benefits under Exelon s ongoing severance benefit plans to terminated employees in the normal course of business, which were not directly related to the
merger with Constellation. These benefits are accrued for when the benefits are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.         
  For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Registrants recorded the following severance costs associated with these
ongoing severance benefits within operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income:         

(a)  
  The amounts above for Generation include $2 million, $0 million, and $1 million for amounts billed by BSC through intercompany allocations for the years ended December 31,
2013, December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively. Amounts billed by BSC to ComEd, PECO and BGE were not material.           
  The severance liability balances associated with these ongoing severance benefits as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are not material.

     18. Preferred and Preference Securities (Exelon, ComEd, PECO and BGE)             At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Exelon was authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred securities, none
of which were outstanding.             Preferred and Preference Securities of
Subsidiaries             At December 31, 2013 and 2012, ComEd
prior preferred securities and ComEd cumulative preference securities consisted of 850,000 shares and 6,810,451 shares authorized, respectively, none of which were outstanding.   
        At December 31, 2012, PECO cumulative preferred securities, no par
value, consisted of 15,000,000 shares authorized and the outstanding amounts set forth below. Shares of preferred securities have full voting rights, including the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. On May 1, 2013, PECO
redeemed all of its outstanding preferred securities. PECO had $87 million of cumulative preferred securities that were redeemable at its option at any time for the redemption price established when each series was issued. The redemption premium is
treated as a reduction to Net income to arrive at Net income attributable to common shareholders utilized in the calculation of the earnings per share for Exelon.   

(a)  
  Redeemable, at the option of PECO, at the indicated dollar amounts per share, plus accrued dividends.              At December 31, 2013 and 2012, BGE cumulative preference stock, $100 par value, consisted of 6,500,000 shares
authorized and the outstanding amounts set forth below. Shares of BGE preference stock have no voting power except for the following:         

The preference stock has one vote per share on any charter amendment which would create or authorize any shares of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the
preference stock as to either dividends or distribution of assets, or which would substantially adversely affect the contract rights, as expressly set forth in BGE s charter, of the preference stock, each of which requires the affirmative vote
of two-thirds of all the shares of preference stock outstanding; and            

Whenever BGE fails to pay full dividends on the preference stock and such failure continues for one year, the preference stock shall have one vote per share on
all matters, until and unless such dividends shall have been paid in full. Upon liquidation, the holders of the preference stock of each series outstanding are entitled to receive the par amount of their shares and an amount equal to the unpaid
accrued dividends.

  Redeemable, at the option of BGE, at the indicated dollar amounts per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.     
           19. Common Stock (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)             The following table presents common stock
authorized and outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:         
          ComEd had 73,709 and 74,182 warrants
outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants.
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, 24,570 and 24,727 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for the conversion of warrants.         
   Share Repurchases          
   Share Repurchase Programs . In April 2004, Exelon s Board of Directors approved a discretionary share repurchase program that allowed
Exelon to repurchase shares of its common stock on a periodic basis in the open market. The share repurchase program was intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive effect of shares issued under Exelon s employee stock option plan and
Exelon s ESPP. The aggregate value of the shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the program cannot exceed the economic benefit received after January 1, 2004 due to stock option exercises and share purchases pursuant to
Exelon s ESPP. The economic benefit consists of the direct cash proceeds from purchases of stock and the tax benefits associated with exercises of stock options. The 2004 share repurchase program had no specified limit on the number of shares
that could be repurchased and no specified termination date. In 2008, Exelon management decided to defer indefinitely any share repurchases. Any shares repurchased are held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion
of Exelon s management. Under the share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2013. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, Exelon had no common stock
repurchases.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
    Stock-Based Compensation Plans    
        Exelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily
includes stock options, restricted stock units and performance share awards. At December 31, 2013, there were approximately 16 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from authorized but unissued common stock shares.         
  The Compensation Committee of Exelon s Board of Directors changed the mix of awards granted under the LTIP in 2013 by eliminating stock options
in favor of the use of full value shares, consisting of performance shares and restricted stock. The performance share awards granted in 2013 will cliff vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The performance share awards granted in 2012
and earlier had a one-year performance period and vested ratably over three years. To address the reduction in annual award opportunity resulting from the transition to a three-year cliff vesting performance period, the Compensation Committee also
approved a one-time grant of performance share transition awards in 2013, which will vest one-third after one year, with the remaining balance vesting over a two-year performance period.            The following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         
          The following table presents
stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         

(a)  
  BGE s stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) for December 31, 2012 excludes $2 million of cost incurred in 2012 prior to the closing of Exelon s merger with
Constellation on March 12, 2012. This amount is not included in Exelon s stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 shown in the tables titled Components of Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Subsidiaries
above.     
         376   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(b)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations. These amounts are not included in the Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE amounts above.     

(c)  
  The stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) for December 31, 2013 reflects the impact of changes to the retirement eligibility requirements for employees participating in
the LTIP. In addition, the stock-based compensation expense at ComEd does not reflect the impact of the ComEd Key Manager Long-Term Performance Program in 2013 for certain employees, which is not considered stock-based compensation expense under the
applicable authoritative guidance. In 2012, these employees participated in the Exelon Restricted Stock Award Program.     

(d)  
  The total stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) for December 31, 2011 of $69 million does not include the $6 million expense for BGE as those costs were incurred prior
to the closing of Exelon s merger with Constellation on March 12, 2012.              There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.   
        Exelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the
award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs.
The tax deductions in excess of the benefits recorded throughout the requisite service period are recorded to common stock and are included in other financing activities within Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table
presents information regarding Exelon s tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         
           Stock Options    
        Non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon s common
stock are granted under the LTIP. The exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. The vesting period of stock options is generally four years. All stock options
expire ten years from the date of grant.            There were no
stock options granted in 2013. The Compensation Committee eliminated stock option grants by changing the mix of long-term incentives for senior vice presidents (SVPs) and higher officers from 75% performance shares and 25% stock options to 67%
performance shares and 33% restricted stock units.            The
value of stock options at the date of grant is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for stock options is generally four years. However, certain stock options become fully vested upon
the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   Historically, Exelon has granted most of its stock options in the first quarter of each year.
Stock options granted during the remaining quarters of 2012 and 2011 were not significant.            The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used in the pricing model for
grants and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended 2012 and 2011:         
          The assumptions above relate to Exelon
stock options granted during the periods presented and therefore do not include stock options that were converted in connection with the merger with Constellation during the year ended 2012.            The dividend yield is based on several factors, including Exelon s most recent dividend payment at the grant date
and the average stock price over the previous year. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities of traded stock options in Exelon s common stock and historical volatility over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The
risk-free interest rate for a security with a term equal to the expected life is based on a yield curve constructed from U.S. Treasury strips at the time of grant. For each year presented, the expected life represents the period of time the
stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Exelon believes that the simplified method is appropriate due to several factors that result in historical exercise data not being sufficient to determine a
reasonable estimate of expected term. Exelon uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.            The following table presents information with respect to stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2013:

  Includes stock options issued to retirement eligible employees.

        The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested stock option
activity for the year ended December 31, 2013:         
     
          At December 31, 2013, $2 million
of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.6 years.   
         Restricted Stock Units    
        Restricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority
being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.   
        The value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite
service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching
retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon uses
historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.

        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of restricted
stock units granted for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $31.06, $39.94 and $43.33, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Exelon had obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units not yet settled of
$77 million and $58 million, respectively, which are included in common stock in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Exelon settled restricted stock units with fair value totaling $28
million, $25 million and $19 million, respectively. At December 31, 2013, $64 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period
of 2.5 years.             Performance Share Awards    
        Performance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The 2013 and 2012
performance share awards are being settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash at the end of the three-year performance period except for awards granted to executive vice presidents and higher officers that may be settled 100% in cash if certain
ownership requirements are satisfied. The performance shares granted prior to 2012 generally vest and settle over a three-year period with the holders receiving shares of common stock and/or cash annually during the vesting period.   
        The one-time 2013 performance share transition awards, which provide an
opportunity to earn an award contingent on company performance, will be settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash, except for awards granted to executive vice presidents and higher officers that may be settled 100% in cash if certain ownership
requirements are satisfied. One-third of the award vests and is payable after a one-year performance period while the remaining two-thirds vests and is payable after a two-year performance period.   
        The payout of the 2013 performance share awards and one-time
performance share transition awards are based on the Company s performance against specific operational and financial goals set annually during the respective performance periods. As a result, the 2013 performance share awards have been divided
into equal tranches for the purpose of expense recognition as though the respective award were multiple awards; with each tranche representing a corresponding fiscal year. The one-time performance share transition awards have also been divided into
multiple tranches for the purpose of expense recognition. One tranche reflects the one-third of the awards that vests and are payable after a one-year period. The two-thirds of the one-time performance share transition awards that are subject to a
two-year performance period have also been divided into equal tranches; with each tranche representing a corresponding fiscal year. The grant date for each tranche of the 2013 performance share and one-time performance share transition awards is the
date in which the performance goals for that fiscal year are approved and communicated, which typically occurs at the corresponding January Compensation Committee meeting.   
        The 2013 performance share awards and one-time performance share
transition awards are recorded at fair value at the grant dates for each tranche, with the estimated grant date fair value based on the expected payout of the award, which may range from 50% to 150% of the payout target. The 2013 performance share
awards also include a total shareholder return modifier (TSR) that may increase or decrease the award up to 25% and an individual performance modifier (IPM) that can   
         380   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
decrease the award by up to 50% or increase the award by up to 10% for SVPs and higher officers or up to 20% for vice presidents. The one-time performance share transition award is not affected
by either TSR or the IPM.            The common stock portion of the
performance share and one-time performance share transition awards is considered an equity award being valued based on Exelon s stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured
each reporting period based on Exelon s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder
return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.         
  The 2012 performance share awards are recorded at fair value at the date of grant with the estimated grant date fair value based on the expected
payout of the award, which may range from 75% to 125% of the payout target. The common stock portion is considered an equity award with the 75% payout floor being valued based on Exelon s stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the
award is considered a liability award with the 75% payout floor being remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon s current stock price. The expected payout in excess of the 75% floor for the equity and liability portions are remeasured
each reporting period based on Exelon s current stock price and changes in the expected payout of the award; therefore these portions of the award are subject to volatility until the payout is established.   
        For nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs
are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the graded-vesting method. For performance share and one-time performance share transition awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares in recognized
ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.         
  The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested performance share awards activity for the year ended December 31, 2013:   

(b)  
  Represents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2013.     
        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of performance
share awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $31.55, $39.71, and $43.52, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Exelon settled performance shares with a fair value
totaling $26 million, $23 million and $22 million, respectively, of which $12 million, $3 million and $10 million was paid in cash, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, $34 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
nonvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

          Earnings per Share     
        Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock outstanding under Exelon s LTIPs considered to be common stock
equivalents. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of these stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used
in calculating diluted earnings per share:         
          The number of stock options not
included in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was approximately 20 million in 2013, 14 million in 2012 and 9 million in 2011.            Under share repurchase programs, 35 million shares of common stock are held as treasury stock with a cost of $2.3
billion as of December 31, 2013. In 2008, Exelon management decided to defer indefinitely any share repurchases.         
    Preferred Securities Redemption (Exelon and PECO)           
  On May 1, 2013, PECO redeemed all of its outstanding preferred securities. PECO had $87 million of cumulative preferred securities that were
redeemable at its option at any time for the redemption price established when each series of securities were issued. The redemption premium of $6 million is treated as a reduction to Net income to arrive at Net income attributable to common
shareholders utilized in the calculation of earnings per share for Exelon for the year ending December 31, 2013. As a result of the redemption, PECO is now indirectly, wholly-owned by Exelon.

           22. Commitments and Contingencies (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd, PECO and BGE)              Nuclear Insurance    
        Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks
associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations, including the CENG nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.   
        The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds
for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and also to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2013, the current
liability limit per incident was $13.6 billion and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors. An inflation adjustment must be made at least once
  
         384   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
every 5 years and the last inflation adjustment was made effective September 10, 2013. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to
the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. As of January 1, 2013, the amount of
nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $375 million for each operating site. Additionally, the Price-Anderson Act requires a second layer of protection through the mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors
(currently 104 reactors) resulting in an additional $13.2 billion in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of
costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Under the Price-Anderson Act, the maximum assessment in the event of an incident for each nuclear operator, per reactor, per incident (including a 5% surcharge),
is $127.3 million, payable at no more than $19 million per reactor per incident per year. Exelon s maximum liability per incident is approximately $2.4 billion.   
        In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on
the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.6 billion limit for a single incident.         
  Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses
sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL,
an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.            NEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years NEIL has made distributions to its members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future
distributions or if they will continue at all. NEIL declared a distribution for 2013, of which Generation s portion was $18.5 million. The distribution was recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and
Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. No distributions were declared in 2011 or 2012. Premiums paid to NEIL by its members are subject to assessment for adverse loss experience (the retrospective premium
obligation). NEIL has never exercised this assessment since its formation in 1973, and while Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments, or if they will be imposed at all, as of December 31, 2013, the current maximum aggregate
annual retrospective premium obligation for Generation is approximately $287 million.            NEIL provides  all risk  property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts
of terrorism. As of December 31, 2013, Generation s current limit for this coverage is $2.1 billion. For property limits in excess of the first $1.25 billion of that limit, Generation participates in an $850 million single limit blanket
policy shared by all the Generation operating nuclear sites and the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear sites. This blanket limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss. In the event of an accident, insurance proceeds must first
be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for
decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. Under the terms of the various
insurance agreements, Generation could be assessed up to $229 million per year for losses incurred at any plant insured by the insurance company (the retrospective premium obligation). In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental
property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental   
         385   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
property damage under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery for all losses by all insureds will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts as the
insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source, applicable to such losses. The $3.2 billion maximum recovery limit is not applicable, however, in the event of a  certified act of terrorism  as
defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act expires on December 31, 2014.   
        Additionally, NEIL provides replacement power cost insurance in the
event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station. The premium for this coverage is subject to assessment for adverse loss experience. Generation s maximum share of any assessment is $58 million per year (the retrospective
premium obligation). Recovery under this insurance for terrorist acts is subject to the $3.2 billion aggregate limit and secondary to the property insurance described above. This limit would not apply in cases of certified acts of terrorism under
the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, as described above.         
  NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation
by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.         
  For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance
maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s
financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.             Spent Nuclear
Fuel Obligation             Under the NWPA, the DOE is responsible
for the development of a geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from
Generation s nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation pays the DOE one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. This fee may be adjusted prospectively
in order to ensure full cost recovery. The NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that
deadline and its performance will be delayed significantly. On November 19, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the DOE to submit to Congress a proposal to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to
zero, unless and until there is a viable disposal program. On January 3, 2014, the DOE filed a petition for rehearing. On the same date, as ordered by the court, the DOE submitted a proposal to Congress to reduce the current SNF disposal fee to
zero, subject to any further judicial decision. The DOE s submitted proposal becomes effective after the 90-days of continuous session of the Congress unless there is Congressional action contrary to the DOE proposal. However, if the court
grants the petition for rehearing, the proposal to eliminate the fee (and the review period) will be held in suspense until after the court rules. Until such time as a new fee structure is in effect, Generation must continue to pay the current SNF
disposal fees.            The 2010 Federal budget (which became
effective October 1, 2009) eliminated almost all funding for the creation of the Yucca Mountain repository while the Obama administration devised a new strategy for long-term SNF management. A Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America s

Future, appointed by the U.S. Energy Secretary, released a report on January 26, 2012, detailing comprehensive recommendations for creating a safe, long-term solution for managing and
disposing of the nation s spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.            In early 2013, the DOE issued an updated  Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste  in response to the BRC recommendations. This strategy included a
consolidated interim storage facility that is planned to be operational in 2025.            Generation uses the 2025 date as the assumed date for when the DOE will begin accepting SNF for purposes of determining nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations. The extended delay in SNF acceptance by
the DOE has led to Generation s adoption of dry cask storage at its Dresden, Clinton, Limerick, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Byron, Braidwood, LaSalle and Quad Cities stations.   
        In August 2004, Generation and the DOJ, in close consultation with the
DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse Generation, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at Generation s nuclear
stations pending the DOE s fulfillment of its obligations. Generation submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases, reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and
only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.            Under the settlement agreement, Generation has received cash reimbursements for costs incurred through April 30, 2013, totaling approximately $712 million ($601 million after considering amounts due to
co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek). As of December 31, 2013, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement will be requested from the DOE under the settlement agreement is $71 million, which
is recorded within Accounts receivable, other. Of this amount, $18 million represents amounts owed to the co-owners of the Peach Bottom and Quad Cities generating facilities.   
        CENG entered into settlement agreements with the DOE during 2011 and
2012 to recover damages caused by the DOE s failure to comply with legal and contractual obligations to dispose of spent nuclear fuel related to the Ginna, Calvert Cliffs and Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants. At December 31, 2012,
Generation had approximately $22 million recorded as a receivable from CENG with respect to costs incurred by Constellation prior to the formation of the CENG joint venture for the Nine Mile Point and Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plants. CENG
received the funds for the Nine Mile Point and Calvert Cliffs settlement from the DOE in January 2013 and February 2013, respectively, and remitted the $22 million to Generation.  
        The Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the
DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear generation through April 6, 1983. The fee related to the former PECO units has been paid. Pursuant to the Standard Contracts, ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $277
million for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. As of December 31, 2013, the unfunded SNF liability for the one-time fee with interest was
$1,021 million. Interest accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week Treasury Rate in effect, for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2013, was 0.051%. The liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee,
were transferred to Generation as part of Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring. The outstanding one-time fee obligations for the Oyster Creek and TMI units remain with the former owners. Clinton has no outstanding obligation. See Note
11 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for additional information.

    Energy Commitments    
        Generation s customer facing activities include the physical
delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity, and long-, intermediate- and short-term contracts. Generation maintains an effective supply strategy through ownership of generation assets and power purchase and lease
agreements. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. These agreements are firm commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature.
Several of Generation s long-term PPAs, which have been determined to be operating leases, have significant contingent rental payments that are dependent on the future operating characteristics of the associated plants, such as plant
availability. Generation recognizes contingent rental expense when it becomes probable of payment. Generation enters into PPAs with the objective of obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to its customers.
Generation has also purchased firm transmission rights to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs. The primary intent and business objective for the use of its capital
assets and contracts is to provide Generation with physical power supply to enable it to deliver energy to meet customer needs. In addition to physical contracts, Generation uses financial contracts for economic hedging purposes and, to a lesser
extent, as part of proprietary trading activities.         
  Generation has entered into bilateral long-term contractual obligations for sales of energy to load-serving entities, including electric utilities,
municipalities, electric cooperatives and retail load aggregators. Generation also enters into contractual obligations to deliver energy to market participants who primarily focus on the resale of energy products for delivery. Generation provides
for delivery of its energy to these customers through firm transmission.            As part of reaching a comprehensive agreement with EDF in October 2010, the existing power purchase agreements with CENG were modified to be unit-contingent through the end of their original term in 2014. Under
these agreements, CENG has the ability to fix the energy price on a forward basis by entering into monthly energy hedge transactions for a portion of the future sale, while any unhedged portions will be provided at market prices by default.
Additionally, beginning in 2015 and continuing to the end of the life of the respective plants, Generation agreed to purchase 50.01% of the nuclear plant output owned by CENG at market prices. Generation discloses in the table below commitments to
purchase from CENG at fixed prices. All commitments to purchase at market prices, which include all purchases subsequent to December 31, 2014, are excluded from the table. Generation continues to own a 50.01% membership interest in CENG that is
accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 5 Investment in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC and Note 25 Related Party Transactions for more details on this arrangement.   
        At December 31, 2013, Generation s short- and long-term
commitments, relating to the purchases from unaffiliated utilities and others of energy, capacity and transmission rights, are as indicated in the following tables:

              Construction Commitments    
        Generation has committed to the construction of the Antelope Valley
solar PV facility in Los Angeles County, California. The first portion of the project began operations in December 2012, with six additional blocks coming online in 2013 and an expectation of full commercial operation in the first half of 2014.
Generation s estimated remaining commitment for the project is $110 million.            On July 3, 2013, Generation executed a Turbine Supply Agreement to expand its Beebe wind project in Michigan. The estimated remaining commitment under the contract is $50 million and achievement of commercial
operations is expected in 2014.            On July 26, 2013,
Generation executed an engineering procurement and construction contract to expand its Perryman, Maryland generation site with 120 MW of new natural gas-fired generation to satisfy certain merger commitments. The estimated remaining commitment under
the contract is $80 million and achievement of commercial operation is expected in 2015. See 4 Merger and Acquisitions for additional information on commitments to develop or assist in development of new generation in Maryland resulting from
the merger.            On December 27, 2013, Generated executed a
Turbine Supply Agreement for construction of the 32.5MW Fourmile Wind project in western Maryland. The estimated remaining commitment under the contract is $26 million and achievement of commercial operations is expected in 2014. See 4 Merger

    Leases          
  Minimum future operating lease payments, including lease payments for vehicles, real estate, computers, rail cars, operating equipment and office
equipment, as of December 31, 2013 were:         

(a)  
  Excludes Generation s PPAs and other capacity contracts that are accounted for as contingent operating lease payments.     

(b)  
  Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses effectively have indefinite payment periods. As a result, ComEd, PECO and BGE have excluded these payments
from the remaining years, as such amounts would not be meaningful. ComEd s, PECO s, and BGE s annual obligation for these arrangements, included in each of the years 2014 2018, was $1 million, $3 million, and $1 million
respectively.     

(c)  
  Includes all future lease payments on a 99 year real estate lease that expires in 2105.     
        The following table presents the Registrants  rental expense under
operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:         

(a)  
  Includes Generation s PPAs and other capacity contracts that are accounted for as operating leases and are reflected as net capacity purchases in the energy commitments
table above. These agreements are considered contingent operating lease payments and are not included in the minimum future operating lease payments table above. Payments made under Generation s PPAs and other capacity contracts totaled $694
million, $801 million and $630 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.              For information regarding capital lease obligations, see Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements.         
   Indemnifications Related to Sale of Sithe (Exelon and Generation)          
  On January 31, 2005, subsidiaries of Generation completed a series of transactions that resulted in Generation s sale of its investment in
Sithe. Specifically, subsidiaries of Generation consummated the acquisition of Reservoir Capital Group s 50% interest in Sithe and subsequently sold 100% of Sithe to Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy).            The estimated maximum possible exposure to Exelon related to the guarantees provided as part of the sales transaction to
Dynegy was approximately $200 million at December 31, 2013. Generation believes that it is remote that it will be required to make any additional payments under the guarantee, and currently has no recorded liabilities associated with this
guarantee. Generation expects that the exposure covered by this guarantee will expire in 2014. The guarantee is included above in the Commercial Commitments table under performance guarantees.

    Indemnifications Related to Sale of TEG and TEP (Exelon and Generation)    
        On February 9, 2007, Tamuin International Inc. (TII), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Generation, sold its 49.5% ownership interests in TEG and TEP to a subsidiary of AES Corporation for $95 million in cash plus certain purchase price adjustments. In connection with the transaction, Generation entered into a
guarantee agreement under which Generation guarantees the timely payment of TII s obligations to the subsidiary of AES Corporation pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement relating to the sale of TII s ownership interests.
Generation was required to perform in the event that TII did not pay any obligation covered by the guarantee that was not otherwise subject to a dispute resolution process. Portions of the exposures covered by this guarantee expired in 2008, and the
remaining guarantee expired in the third quarter of 2013. Generation was not required to make payments under the guarantee, and therefore, has no further obligation related to this guarantee as of December 31, 2013.   
         Environmental Matters               General.   The Registrants  operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial
expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property currently or formerly owned
by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination
by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional
proceedings in the future.            ComEd, PECO and BGE have
identified sites where former MGP activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For many of these sites, ComEd, PECO or BGE is one of several PRPs that may be responsible for ultimate remediation of each location.   

ComEd has identified 42 sites, 16 of which have been approved for cleanup by the Illinois EPA or the U.S. EPA and 26 that are currently under some degree of
active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2016.            

PECO has identified 26 sites, 16 of which have been approved for cleanup by the PA DEP and 10 that are currently under some degree of active study and/or
remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2020.            

BGE has identified 13 former gas manufacturing or purification sites that it currently owns or owned at one time through a predecessor s acquisition. Two
gas manufacturing sites require some level of remediation and ongoing monitoring under the direction of the MDE. The required costs at these two sites are not considered material. One gas purification site is in the initial stages of investigation
at the direction of the MDE.               ComEd,
pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. BGE is authorized to and
is currently recovering environmental costs for the remediation of former MGP facility sites from customers; however, while BGE does not have a rider for MGP clean-up costs, BGE has historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in
distribution rates. ComEd, PECO and BGE have recorded regulatory assets for the recovery of these

costs. During the third quarter of 2013, ComEd and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. The results of these studies indicated that additional
remediation would be required at certain sites; accordingly, ComEd and PECO increased their reserves and regulatory assets by less than $1 million and $6 million, respectively. BGE assessed its currently and formerly owned gas manufacturing and
purification sites quarterly in 2013 and determined that a loss was not probable at ten of its sites as of December 31, 2013. As discussed above, the remediation costs at two of BGE s MGP sites are not considered material. Furthermore, an
estimate of a range of possible loss, if any, related to BGE s gas purification site under investigation cannot be determined as of December 31, 2013 given that the site is in the early stages of investigation and the extent of
contamination is currently unknown. See Note 3 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the associated regulatory assets.         
  The historical nature of the MGP sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the ability to determine a
precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial action. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs based on probabilistic modeling and deterministic
estimates using all available information at the time of each study and the remediation standards currently required by the U.S. EPA. Prior to completion of any significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state
environmental agency.            As of December 31, 2013 and
2012, the Registrants have accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in other current liabilities and other deferred credits and other liabilities within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:   

The Registrants cannot reasonably
estimate whether they will incur other significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable
from third parties, including customers.              Water Quality
               Section 316(b) of the Clean Water
Act.   Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit
programs. All of

Generation s and CENG s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling
towers) are potentially most affected by changes to the existing regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Gould Street, Handley, Mountain Creek, Mystic 7, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities,
Riverside, Salem and Schuylkill. For CENG, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 and R.E. Ginna.         
  On March 28, 2011, the U.S. EPA issued the proposed regulation under Section 316(b). The proposal does not require closed-cycle cooling
(e.g., cooling towers) as the best technology available to address impingement and entrainment. The proposal provides the state permitting agency with discretion to determine the best technology available to limit entrainment (drawing aquatic life
into the plants cooling system) mortality, including application of a cost-benefit test and the consideration of a number of site-specific factors. After consideration of these factors, the state permitting agency may require closed cycle cooling,
an alternate technology, or determine that the current technology is the best available. The proposed rule also imposes limits on impingement (trapping aquatic life on screens) mortality, which likely will be accomplished by the installation of
screens or another technology at the intake. Exelon filed comments on the proposed regulation on August 18, 2011, stating its support for a number of its provisions (e.g., cooling towers not required as best technology available, and the use of
site-specific and cost benefit analysis) while also noting a number of technical provisions that require revision to take into account existing unit operations and practices within the industry.   
        In June 2012, the U.S. EPA published two Notices of Data Availability
(NODA) seeking public comment on alternate compliance technologies for impingement and the use of a public opinion survey to calculate the so-called  non-use  benefits of the rule. Exelon filed comments for each NODA, supporting the
additional flexibility afforded by the impingement NODA, and opposing the NODA relating to calculation of non-use benefits due to its inaccurate and unreliable methodologies that would artificially inflate the benefits of proposed technologies that
would otherwise not be cost-effective. On June 27, 2013, the U.S. EPA agreed to amend the court approved Settlement Agreement to extend the deadline to issue a final rule until November 4, 2013 and on October 30, 2013 the U.S. EPA
invoked the  force majeure  provision of the Settlement Agreement to extend the final rule deadline until January 14, 2014 due to the early October 2013 federal government shutdown. The U.S. EPA and the plaintiffs have again agreed to
extend the date for issuance of the final rule until April 17, 2014. Until the rule is finalized, the state permitting agencies will continue to apply their best professional judgment to address impingement and entrainment.   
          Salem and Other Power Generation Facilities.   In June
2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with its existing cooling water system. NJDEP advised PSEG, in July 2004 that it strongly recommended reducing cooling water intake flow
commensurate with closed-cycle cooling as a compliance option for Salem. PSEG submitted an application for a renewal of the permit on February 1, 2006. In the permit renewal application, PSEG analyzed closed-cycle cooling and other options and
demonstrated that the continuation of the Estuary Enhancement Program, an extensive environmental restoration program at Salem, is the best technology to meet the Section 316(b) requirements. PSEG continues to operate Salem under the approved
June 2001 NPDES permit while the NPDES permit renewal application is being reviewed. If the final permit or Section 316(b) regulations ultimately requires the retrofitting of Salem s cooling water intake structure to reduce cooling water
intake flow commensurate with closed-cycle cooling, Exelon s and Generation s share of the total cost of the retrofit and any resulting interim replacement power would likely be in excess of $430 million, based on a 2006 estimate, and
would result in increased depreciation expense related to the retrofit investment.   
         397   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   It is unknown at this time whether the NJDEP permit programs will require closed-cycle cooling at
Salem. In addition, the economic viability of Generation s other power generation facilities, as well as CENG s, without closed-cycle cooling water systems will be called into question by any requirement to construct cooling towers. Should
the final rule not require the installation of cooling towers, and retain the flexibility afforded the state permitting agencies in applying a cost benefit test and to consider site-specific factors, the impact of the rule would be minimized even
though the costs of compliance could be material to Generation and CENG.            Given the uncertainties associated with the requirements that will be contained in the final rule, Generation cannot predict the eventual outcome or estimate the effect that compliance with any resulting
Section 316(b) or interim state requirements will have on the operation of its and CENG s generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
          Groundwater Contamination.   In October 2007, a subsidiary
of Constellation entered into a consent decree with the MDE relating to groundwater contamination at a third-party facility that was licensed to accept fly ash, a byproduct generated by coal-fired plants. The consent decree required the payment of a
$1 million penalty, remediation of groundwater contamination resulting from the ash placement operations at the site, replacement of drinking water supplies in the vicinity of the site, and monitoring of groundwater conditions. Prior to the Merger,
Constellation recorded in its Consolidated Balance Sheets total liabilities of approximately $30 million to comply with the consent decree with an additional $3 million recognized through purchase accounting. During third quarter of 2013,
Generation increased its reserve by $2 million based on an update of future estimated remediation costs. The remaining liability as of December 31, 2013, is approximately $14 million. In addition, a private party asserted claims relating
to groundwater contamination. Generation has reached an agreement in principle to resolve these claims. The amount of the settlement is not material to the financial condition of Generation.              Alleged Conemaugh Clean Streams Act Violation.   The PA DEP has alleged that GenOn Northeast
Management Company (GenOn), the operator of Conemaugh Generating Station, violated the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law. GenOn reached agreement with PA DEP on a proposed Consent Decree that was approved by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania
on December 4, 2012. Under the Consent Decree, GenOn is obligated to pay a civil penalty of $0.5 million, of which Generation s responsibility was approximately $0.2 million. Generation made the final payment in January 2014 and is
complying with the Consent Decree.              Air Quality       
               Cross-State Air
Pollution Rule (CSAPR).   On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court) vacated the CAIR, which had been promulgated by the U.S. EPA to reduce power plant emissions of SO   2    and NO   x   . The D.C. Circuit Court later remanded the CAIR to the U.S. EPA, without invalidating the entire rulemaking, so that the U.S. EPA
could correct CAIR in accordance with the D.C. Circuit Court s July 11, 2008 opinion. On July 7, 2011, the U.S. EPA published the final rule, known as the CSAPR. The CSAPR requires 28 states in the eastern half of the United States to
significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other states.   
        Numerous entities challenged the CSAPR in the D.C. Circuit Court, and
some requested a stay of the rule pending the Court s consideration of the matter on the merits. On December 30, 2011, the Court granted a stay of the CSAPR, and directed the U.S. EPA to continue the administration of CAIR in the interim.
On August 21, 2012, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court held that the U.S. EPA   
         398

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
has exceeded its authority in certain material aspects of the CSAPR and vacated the rule and remanded it to the U.S. EPA for further rulemaking consistent with its decision. The Court also
ordered that CAIR remain in effect pending finalization of CSAPR on remand. The Court s order was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where oral argument was held on December 10, 2013. A decision is expected sometime during 2014.
           Under the CSAPR, generation units were
to receive allowances based on historic heat input and intrastate, and limited interstate, trading of allowances was permitted. The CSAPR restricted entirely the use of pre-2012 allowances. Existing SO   2    allowances under the ARP would remain available for use under ARP. As of December 31, 2013, Generation had $56 million of
emission allowances carried at the lower of weighted average cost or market.              EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).   The MATS rule became final on April 16, 2012. The MATS rule reduces emissions of toxic air pollutants, and finalized the new source performance
standards for fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs). The MATS rule requires coal-fired EGUs to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals from air emissions. To achieve these standards, coal units
with no pollution control equipment installed (uncontrolled coal units) will have to make capital investments and incur higher operating expenses. It is expected that smaller, older, uncontrolled coal units will retire rather than make these
investments. Coal units with existing controls that do not meet the required standards may need to upgrade existing controls or add new controls to comply. In addition, the new standards will require oil units to achieve high removal rates of
metals. Owners of oil units not currently meeting the proposed emission standards may choose to convert the units to light oils or natural gas, install control technologies or retire the units. The MATS rule requires generating stations to meet the
new standards three years after the rule takes effect, April 16, 2015, with specific guidelines for an additional one or two years in limited cases. Numerous entities have challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon was granted
permission by the Court to intervene in support of the rule. A decision by the Court is expected sometime during 2014. The outcome of the appeal, and its impact on power plant operators  investment and retirement decisions, is uncertain.
           Exelon, along with the other co-owners of Conemaugh
Generating Station are moving forward with plans to improve the existing scrubbers and install Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) controls to meet the mercury removal requirements of MATS.            In addition, as of December 31, 2013, Exelon had a $698 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia and
Texas subject to long-term leases extending through 2028-2032. While Exelon currently estimates the value of these plants at the end of the lease term will be in excess of the recorded residual lease values, after the impairment recorded in the
second quarter of 2013, final applications of the CSAPR and MATS regulations could negatively impact the end-of-lease term values of these assets, which could result in a future impairment loss that could be material.   
          National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).   The U.S.
EPA previously announced that it would complete a review of all NAAQS by 2014. Oral argument in the litigation ( State of Miss. v. EPA ) of the final 2008 ozone standard occurred in the D.C. Circuit Court in November 2012 and a final Court
decision was issued on July 23, 2013 with the 2008 primary ozone standard upheld, but the secondary standard remanded to EPA for reconsideration. Concurrent with litigation of the 2008 ozone standard, the U.S. EPA continues its regular,
periodic review of the ozone NAAQS and is expected to propose revisions in the fall of 2014, with preliminary indications that the U.S. EPA will likely propose a tightened standard. It is unclear at this point in time whether the U.S. EPA will be
able to respond to the Court remand of the secondary 2008 ozone standard on a timeframe that would be any quicker than   
         399

that of the U.S. EPA s current, periodic review schedule. In December 2012, the U.S. EPA issued its final revisions to the Agency s particulate matter (PM) NAAQS. In its final rule, the
U.S. EPA lowered the annual PM2.5 standard, but declined to issue a new secondary NAAQS to improve urban visibility. The U.S. EPA indicated in its final rule that by 2020 it expects most areas of the country will be in attainment of the new PM2.5
NAAQS based on currently expected regulations, such as the MATS regulation. It is unclear if the vacatur of the CSAPR, one of the regulations that the U.S. EPA is relying on to assist with future PM reduction, would alter the U.S. EPA s view
since either CAIR or a finalized CSAPR regulation would be in effect leading up to 2020. In March 2013, a number of industry coalitions filed a joint lawsuit challenging the new PM2.5 standard. Also during early 2013, the D.C. Circuit remanded
several rules for implementation of earlier PM2.5 NAAQS to the U.S. EPA for revision of certain aspects of the rules, with a requirement that the U.S. EPA re-promulgate regulations in conformance with the correct subparts of the Clean Air Act.
           In addition to these NAAQS, the U.S.
EPA also finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas in the United States for the 2010 one-hour SO   2    standard on August 5, 2013, and indicated that additional nonattainment areas will be designated in a future rulemaking. U.S. EPA will require states to submit state implementation plans (SIPs) for
nonattainment areas by April 2015. With regard to Texas and Maryland, no nonattainment areas were identified in U.S. EPA s final designation rule. With regard to Illinois and Pennsylvania, several counties, or portions of counties, in each
state were identified as nonattainment. The U.S. EPA will follow the approach outlined in a February 2013 U.S. EPA strategy document that establishes a process and timeline for the Agency to address additional designations in states  counties
under a future rulemaking. Nonattainment county compliance with the one-hour SO   2   
standard is required by October 2018. While significant SO   2    reductions will occur
as a result of MATS compliance in 2015, Exelon is unable to predict the requirements of pending states  SIPs to further reduce
SO   2    emissions in support of attainment of the one hour SO   2    standard.   
          Notices and Finding of Violations and Midwest Generation
Bankruptcy.   In December 1999, ComEd sold several generating stations to Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation), a subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy (EME). Under the terms of the sale agreement, Midwest Generation and EME assumed
responsibility for environmental liabilities associated with the ownership, occupancy, use and operation of the stations, including responsibility for compliance by the stations with environmental laws before their purchase by Midwest Generation.
Midwest Generation and EME additionally agreed to indemnify and hold ComEd and its affiliates harmless from claims, fines, penalties, liabilities and expenses arising from third-party claims against ComEd resulting from or arising out of the
environmental liabilities assumed by Midwest Generation and EME under the terms of the agreement governing the sale. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed ComEd s rights and obligations with respect
to its former generation business, including its rights and obligations under the sale agreement with Midwest Generation and EME.         
  On December 17, 2012 (Petition Date), EME and certain of its subsidiaries, including Midwest Generation, filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.            In 2012, the Bankruptcy Court
approved the rejection of a coal rail car lease under which Midwest Generation had agreed to reimburse ComEd for all obligations. The rejection left Generation as the party responsible to make remaining payments under the lease. In January 2013,
Generation made the final $10 million payment due under the lease agreement which had been accrued at December 31, 2012.   
         400   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   During the second quarter of 2013, Exelon filed proofs of claim of $21 million with the Bankruptcy
Court for amounts owed by EME and Midwest Generation for the coal rail car lease, ComEd utility payments and certain legal costs. Further, Exelon filed an environmental claim with an unspecified amount that listed the indemnifications that were in
place pre-Petition Date and other factors associated with the remediation. As of December 31, 2013, Exelon has not recorded a receivable for the filed proofs of claim because recovery of any amount cannot be assured at this point in the
bankruptcy. Exelon will not record claim recoveries unless and until they are realized.            Certain environmental laws and regulations subject current and prior owners of properties or generators of hazardous substances at such properties to liability for remediation costs of environmental contamination.
As a prior owner of the generating stations, ComEd (and Generation, through its agreement in Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring to assume ComEd s rights and obligations associated with its former generation business) could face
liability (along with any other potentially responsible parties) for environmental conditions at the stations requiring remediation, with the determination of the allocation among the parties subject to many uncertain factors, including the impact
of Midwest Generation s bankruptcy. On January 17, 2014, Midwest Generation filed a plan supplement to its bankruptcy filing that included a request to reject the sale agreement, including the environmental indemnity. ComEd and Generation
have reviewed available public information as to potential environmental exposures regarding the Midwest Generation station sites. Midwest Generation publicly disclosed in its quarter ending September 30, 2013 Form 10-Q that (i) it has
accrued a probable amount of approximately $8 million for estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs under CERCLA, or similar laws, for the investigation and remediation of contaminated property at four Midwest Generation plant
sites, (ii) it has identified stations for which a reasonable estimate for investigation and/ or remediation cannot be made and (iii) it and the Illinois EPA entered into Compliance Commitment Agreements outlining specified environmental
remediation measures and groundwater monitoring activities to be undertaken at its Crawford, Powerton, Joliet, Will County and Waukegan generating stations. At this time, however, ComEd and Generation do not have sufficient information to reasonably
assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted. For these reasons, ComEd and Generation are unable to predict whether and to what extent they may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and
other costs relating to the generating stations and as a result no liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2013. Any liability imposed on ComEd or Generation for environmental matters relating to the generating stations could have a
material adverse impact on their future results of operations and cash flows.            Under a supplemental agreement reached in 2003, Midwest Generation agreed to reimburse ComEd and Generation for 50% of the specific asbestos claims pending as of February 2003 and related expenses less recovery of
insurance costs and agreed to a sharing arrangement for liabilities and expenses associated with future asbestos-related claims as specified in the agreement. In addition to the sale agreement, Midwest Generation also requested to reject this
supplemental agreement in the January 17, 2014 plan supplement to its bankruptcy filing. Exelon and Generation had previously expected Midwest Generation or its successor would remain responsible for asbestos personal injury claims filed
post-Petition Date, and as a result had not recorded a liability for such amounts. Exelon and Generation now believe that the rejection of the 1999 sale and supplemental agreements is probable, and as a result, Generation has increased its reserve
for asbestos-related bodily injury claims at December 31, 2013 by $25 million. The increase in the reserve was estimated using actuarial assumptions and analyses available to Generation. Generation s exposure could differ to the extent new
information is received or made available. Midwest Generation publicly disclosed in its quarter ending September 30, 2013 Form 10-Q that they had $53 million recorded related to asbestos bodily injury claims under the contractual indemnity with
ComEd. If the agreements are rejected, Exelon and   
         401

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Generation may be entitled to damages associated with the agreement terminations. These amounts are considered to be contingent gains and would not be recognized until realized.   
        On October 18, 2013, NRG Energy entered into an agreement to buy
EME s portfolio of generation subject to regulatory approvals. Exelon continues to monitor all aspects of the bankruptcy; the proposed purchase by NRG has not impacted any accounting conclusions as of December 31, 2013.   
        In May 2010, the United States and State of Illinois initiated a
lawsuit against Midwest Generation, ComEd and EME alleging Clean Air Act violations relating to the modification and/or operation of six (coal) electric generation plants in Northern Illinois, which ComEd sold to Midwest Generation/EME in 1999. The
government parties sought injunctive relief and civil penalties against all defendants, although not all of the claims specifically pertained to ComEd. On March 16, 2011, the District Court granted ComEd s motion to dismiss the May 2010
complaint in its entirety as it relates to ComEd. On January 3, 2012, upon leave of the District Court, the government parties appealed the dismissal of ComEd to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On July 8, 2013,
the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court s dismissal of the complaint against ComEd. On September 19, 2013, the Circuit Court denied the petition for a rehearing filed by the governmental parties. The government parties did not seek
United States Supreme Court review of the Seventh Circuit s decision. The deadline for seeking such review was in December 2013. In light of the Circuit Court decision resolving this matter in favor of ComEd, no reserve has been established.
             Solid and Hazardous Waste     
          Cotter Corporation.   The U.S. EPA has advised Cotter
Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. On February 18, 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated
third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was
transferred to Generation. On May 29, 2008, the U.S. EPA issued a Record of Decision approving the remediation option submitted by Cotter and the two other PRPs that required additional landfill cover. The current estimated cost of the
anticipated landfill cover remediation for the site is approximately $42 million, which will be allocated among all PRPs. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated share of such liability. By letter
dated January 11, 2010, the U.S. EPA requested that the PRPs perform a supplemental feasibility study for a remediation alternative that would involve complete excavation of the radiological contamination. On September 30, 2011, the PRPs
submitted the final supplemental feasibility study to the U.S. EPA for review. In June 2012, the U.S. EPA requested that the PRPs perform additional analysis and groundwater sampling as part of the supplemental feasibility study that could take up
to one year to complete, and subsequently requested additional analysis sampling and modeling to be conducted into 2014. In light of these additional requests, it is unknown when the U.S EPA will propose a remedy for public comment. Thereafter the
U.S. EPA will select a final remedy and enter into a Consent Decree with the PRPs to effectuate the remedy. A complete excavation remedy would be significantly more expensive than the previously selected additional cover remedy; however, Generation
believes the likelihood that the U.S. EPA would require a complete excavation remedy is remote.            On August 8, 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the government s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a
former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty   
         402

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Avenue site is included in ComEd s indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in connection with
the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. government s Manhattan Project. Cotter purchased the residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In 1976, the NRC
found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination of land areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under the Formerly Utilized
Sites Remedial Action Program. The DOJ has not yet formally advised the PRPs of the amount that it is seeking, but it is believed to be approximately $90 million. The DOJ and the PRPs agreed to toll the statute of limitations until August 2014 so
that settlement discussions could proceed. Based on Exelon s preliminary review, it appears probable that Exelon has liability to Cotter under the indemnification agreement and has established an appropriate accrual for this liability.
           On February 28, 2012, and April 12, 2012, two
lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against 15 and 14 defendants, respectively, including Exelon, Generation and ComEd (the  Exelon defendants ) and Cotter. The suits allege that individuals
living in the North St. Louis area developed some form of cancer due to the defendants  negligent or reckless conduct in processing, transporting, storing, handling and/or disposing of radioactive materials. Plaintiffs have asserted claims for
negligence, strict liability, emotional distress, medical monitoring, and violations of the Price-Anderson Act. The complaints do not contain specific damage claims. On May 30, 2012, the plaintiffs filed voluntary motions to dismiss the Exelon
defendants from both lawsuits which were subsequently granted. Since May 30, 2012, several related lawsuits have been filed in the same court on behalf of various plaintiffs against Cotter and other defendants, but not Exelon. The allegations
in these related lawsuits mirror the initially filed lawsuits. In the event of a finding of liability, it is reasonably possible that Exelon would be considered liable due to its indemnification responsibilities of Cotter described above. On
March 27, 2013, the U.S. District Court dismissed all state common law actions brought under the initial two lawsuits; and also found that the plaintiffs had not properly brought the actions under the Price-Anderson Act. On July 8, 2013,
the plaintiffs filed amended complaints under the Price-Anderson Act. Cotter moved to dismiss the amended complaints and has motions currently pending before the court. At this stage of the litigation, Exelon cannot estimate a range of loss, if any.
             68th Street Dump.   In 1999, the U.S. EPA
proposed to add the 68th Street Dump in Baltimore, Maryland to the Superfund National Priorities List, and notified BGE and 19 others that they are PRPs at the site. In March 2004, BGE and other PRPs formed the 68th Street Coalition and entered into
consent order negotiations with the U.S. EPA to investigate clean-up options for the site under the Superfund Alternative Sites Program. In May 2006, a settlement among the U.S. EPA and 19 of the PRPs, including BGE, with respect to investigation of
the site became effective. The settlement requires the PRPs, over the course of several years, to identify contamination at the site and recommend clean-up options. The PRPs submitted their investigation of the range of clean-up options in the first
quarter of 2011. Although the investigation and options provided to the U.S. EPA are still subject to U.S. EPA review and selection of a remedy, the range of estimated clean-up costs to be allocated among all of the PRPs is in the range of $50
million to $64 million. On September 30, 2013, U.S. EPA issued the Record of Decision identifying its preferred remedial alternative for the site. The estimated cost for the alternative chosen by U.S. EPA is consistent with the PRPs estimated
range of costs noted above. Based on Exelon s preliminary review, it appears probable that Exelon has liability and has established an appropriate accrual for its share of the estimated clean-up costs. BGE is indemnified by a wholly owned
subsidiary of Generation for most of the costs related to this settlement and clean-up of the site.

     Rossville Ash Site.   The Rossville Ash Site is a 32-acre property located in
Rosedale, Baltimore County, Maryland, which was used for the placement of fly ash from 1983-2007. The property is owned by Constellation Power Source Generation, LLC(CPSG). In 2008, CPSG investigated and remediated the property by entering it into
the Maryland Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) to address any historic environmental concerns and ready the site for appropriate future redevelopment. The site was accepted into the program in 2010 and is currently going through the process to
remediate the site and receive closure from MDE. Exelon currently estimates the cost to close the site to be approximately $6 million, which has been fully reserved as of December 31, 2013.   
          Sauer Dump.   On May 30, 2012, BGE was notified by the
U.S. EPA that it is considered a PRP at the Sauer Dump Superfund site in Dundalk, Maryland. The U.S. EPA offered BGE and three other PRPs the opportunity to conduct an environmental investigation and present cleanup recommendations at the site. In
addition, the U.S. EPA is seeking recovery from the PRPs of $1.7 million for past cleanup and investigation costs at the site. On March 11, 2013, BGE and three other PRP s signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent
with the U.S. EPA which requires the PRP s to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study at the site to determine what, if any, are the appropriate and recommended cleanup activities for the site. The ultimate outcome of this
proceeding is uncertain. Since the U.S. EPA has not selected a cleanup remedy and the allocation of the cleanup costs among the PRPs has not been determined, an estimate of the range of BGE s reasonably possible loss, if any, cannot be
determined.             Climate Change
Regulation.   Exelon is subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the Federal, regional and state levels. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that GHG emissions are pollutants subject to regulation under the new motor
vehicle provisions of the Clean Air Act. Consequently, on December 7, 2009, the U.S. EPA issued an endangerment finding under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act regarding GHGs from new motor vehicles and on April 1, 2010 issued final
regulations limiting GHG emissions from cars and light trucks effective on January 2, 2011. While such regulations do not specifically address stationary sources, such as a generating plant, it is the U.S. EPA s position that the
regulation of GHGs under the mobile source provisions of the Clean Air Act has triggered the permitting requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permit sections of the Clean Air Act for new and
modified stationary sources effective January 2, 2011. Therefore, on May 13, 2010, the U.S. EPA issued final regulations (the Tailoring Rule) relating to these provisions of the Clean Air Act for major stationary sources of GHG emissions
that apply to new sources that emit greater than 100,000 tons per year, on a CO   2   
equivalent basis, and to modifications to existing sources that result in emissions increases greater than 75,000 tons per year on a
CO   2    equivalent basis. These thresholds became effective January 2, 2011,
apply for six years and will be reviewed by the U.S. EPA for future applicability thereafter. On July 2, 2012 the U.S. EPA declined to lower GHG permit thresholds in its final  Step 3  Tailoring Rule update. The U.S. EPA will review
permit thresholds again in a 2015 rulemaking process. On June 26, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a  per curium  decision, dismissed industry and state petitions challenging the U.S. EPA s
 Tailpipe Rule  for cars and light duty trucks, the endangerment finding for GHG s from stationary sources, and the Tailoring Rule. On October 15, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted industry petitions to review one aspect of the
PSD permitting regulations. Under the PSD regulations, new and modified major stationary sources could be required to install best available control technology, to be determined on a case by case basis. Generation could be significantly affected by
the regulations if it were to build new plants or modify existing plants.            On June 25, 2013, President Obama announced  The President s Climate Action Plan,  a summary of executive branch actions intended to: reduce carbon emissions; prepare the United States
  
         404   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
for the impacts of climate change; and lead international efforts to combat global climate change and prepare for its impacts. Concurrent with the announcement of the Administration s plan,
the President also issued a Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that focused on power generation sector carbon reductions under the Section 111 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) section of the federal
Clean Air Act. The memorandum directs the U.S. EPA Administrator to issue two sets of proposed rulemakings with regard to power plant carbon emissions under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act.   
        The first rulemaking, under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act is
to focus on establishing carbon regulations for new fossil-fuel power plants. This rulemaking was proposed on September 20, 2013 and is to be finalized  in a timely fashion.  In the proposed rule U.S.EPA sets separate standards for
fossil-fuel fired utility boilers and natural gas fired stationary combustion turbines.            The second rulemaking, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act is to focus on modified, reconstructed and existing fossil power plants. The rulemaking is to be proposed no later than June 1, 2014, be
finalized no later than June 1, 2015, and require that states submit to U.S. EPA their implementation plans no later than June 30, 2016. In developing this rulemaking, U.S. EPA is directed to consider a number of factors, including options
to reduce costs, options to ensure the continued use of a range of energy sources and technologies, options that are consistent with reliable and affordable power, and options that allow for the use of market-based instruments, performance standards
and other regulatory flexibilities.            To the extent that the
final Section 111(d) rule results in emission reductions from fossil fuel fired plants, and thereby imposes some form of direct or indirect price of carbon in competitive electricity markets, Exelon s overall low-carbon generation
portfolio results could benefit.             Litigation and Regulatory Matters
              Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (Exelon,
Generation, PECO and BGE).                Exelon and
Generation.   Generation maintains a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The reserve is recorded
on an undiscounted basis and excludes the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.         
  At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Generation had reserved approximately $90 million and $63 million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related
bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $19 million of this amount related to 224 open claims presented to Generation, while the remaining $71 million of the reserve is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily
injury claims anticipated to arise through 2050, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received
and expected claim payments and evaluates whether an adjustment to the reserve is necessary.            On November 22, 2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Act does not apply to an employee s disability or death resulting from occupational disease, such as
diseases related to asbestos exposure, which manifests more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure, and that therefore the exclusivity provision of the Act does not apply to preclude such employee from suing his or
her employer in court. The Supreme   
         405

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
Court s ruling reverses previous rulings by the Pennsylvania Superior Court precluding current and former employees from suing their employers in court, despite the fact that the same
employee was not eligible for workers compensation benefits for diseases that manifest more than 300 weeks after the employee s last employment-based exposure to asbestos. Currently, Exelon, Generation and PECO are unable to predict
whether and to what extent they may experience additional claims in the future as a result of this ruling; as such no increase to the asbestos-related bodily injury liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2013. Increased claims
activity resulting from this ruling could have a material adverse impact on Exelon, Generation s and PECO s future results of operations and cash flows.  
         BGE.  Since 1993, BGE and certain Constellation (now Generation)
subsidiaries have been involved in several actions concerning asbestos. The actions are based upon the theory of  premises liability,  alleging that BGE and Generation knew of and exposed individuals to an asbestos hazard. In addition to
BGE and Generation, numerous other parties are defendants in these cases.            Approximately 486 individuals who were never employees of BGE or certain Constellation subsidiaries have pending claims each seeking several million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. Cross-claims and
third-party claims brought by other defendants may also be filed against BGE and certain Constellation subsidiaries in these actions. To date, most asbestos claims which have been resolved have been dismissed or resolved without any payment by BGE
or certain Constellation subsidiaries and a small minority of these cases has been resolved for amounts that were not material to BGE or Generation s financial results.   
        Discovery begins in these cases after they are placed on the trial
docket. At present, only two of the pending cases are set for trial. Given the limited discovery in these cases, BGE and Generation do not know the specific facts that are necessary to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss relating to
these claims; as such, no accrual has been made and a range of loss is not estimable. The specific facts not known include:         

the identity of the facilities at which the plaintiffs allegedly worked as contractors;      

the names of the plaintiffs  employers;            

the dates on which and the places where the exposure allegedly occurred; and            

the facts and circumstances relating to the alleged exposure.      
        Insurance and hold harmless agreements from contractors who employed
the plaintiffs may cover a portion of any awards in the actions.              Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Investigation (Exelon and Generation).           
  On January 30, 2012, FERC published a notice on its website regarding a non-public investigation of certain of Constellation s power
trading activities in and around the ISO-NY from September 2007 through December 2008. Prior to the merger, Constellation announced on March 9, 2012, that it had resolved the FERC investigation. Under the settlement, Constellation agreed to
pay, and has paid, a $135 million civil penalty and $110 million in disgorgement.            During the year ended December 31, 2012, Generation recorded expense of $195 million in operating and maintenance expense with the remaining $50 million recorded as a Constellation pre-acquisition contingency.

     Continuous Power Interruption (ComEd)     
        Section 16-125 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that
in the event an electric utility, such as ComEd, experiences a continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in ComEd s case) more than 30,000 customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as
a result of the interruption and may be responsible for reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek
from the ICC a waiver of these liabilities when the utility can show that the cause of the interruption was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law.   
        On August 18, 2011, ComEd sought from the ICC a determination that
ComEd is not liable for damage compensation to customers in connection with the July 11, 2011 storm system that produced multiple power interruptions that in the aggregate affected more than 900,000 customers in ComEd s service territory,
as well as for five other storm systems that affected ComEd s customers during June and July 2011 (Summer 2011 Storm Docket). In addition, on September 29, 2011, ComEd sought from the ICC a determination that it was not liable for damage
compensation related to the February 1, 2011 blizzard (February 2011 Blizzard Docket).            On June 5, 2013, the ICC approved a complete waiver of liability for five of the six summer storms and the February 2011 blizzard. However, the ICC held that for the July 11, 2011 storm, 34,559
interruptions were preventable and therefore no waiver should apply. As required by the ICC s Order, ComEd notified relevant customers that they may be entitled to seek reimbursement of incurred costs in accordance with a claims procedure
established under ICC rules and regulations. In addition, the ICC found that ComEd did not systematically fail in its duty to provide adequate, reliable and safe service. As a result, the ICC rejected the Illinois Attorney General s request for
the ICC to open an investigation into ComEd s infrastructure and storm hardening investments.            Following the ICC s June 26, 2013 denial of ComEd s request for rehearing, on June 27, 2013 ComEd filed an appeal of both the summer and winter storm dockets with the Illinois Appellate Court
regarding the ICC s interpretation of Section 16-125 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act. ComEd cannot predict the outcome of appeals.         
  As a result of the ICC s June 5, 2013 ruling, ComEd established a liability, which was not material, for potential reimbursements for
actual damages incurred by the 34,559 customers covered by the ICC s June 5, 2013 Order. The liability recorded represents the low end of a range of potential losses given that no amount within the range represents a better estimate.
ComEd s ultimate liability will be based on actual claims eligible for reimbursement as well as the outcome of the appeal. Although reimbursements for actual damages will differ from the estimated accrual recorded, at this time ComEd does not
expect the difference to be material to ComEd s results of operations or cash flows.            ComEd has not recorded an accrual for reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses as a range of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but may be material to
ComEd s results of operations and cash flows.         
    Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit (ComEd)     
        On November 19, 2013, a class action complaint was filed in Cook
County on behalf of a single individual and a presumptive class that would include all customers in ComEd s service territory who   
         407   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
were enrolled by the Company in ComEd s Outage Alert text message program. The complaint alleges that ComEd violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) by sending
approximately 1.2 million text messages to customers without first obtaining their consent to receive such messages. The complaint seeks certification of a class along with statutory damages, attorneys  fees, and an order prohibiting
ComEd from sending additional text messages. Such statutory damages could range from $500 to $1,500 per text. However, ComEd is preparing a motion to dismiss this class action complaint and will vigorously contest the allegations of this suit.
The ultimate outcome of this proceeding is uncertain, and an amount, if any, which might be asserted, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but may be material to ComEd s results of operations and cash flows. As a result, ComEd has not
established a reserve for this complaint as of December 31, 2013.              Securities Class Action (Exelon)              Three federal securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the District of Maryland between September 2008 and November 2008 against
Constellation. The cases were filed on behalf of a proposed class of persons who acquired publicly traded securities, including the Series A Junior Subordinated Debentures (Debentures), of Constellation between January 30, 2008 and
September 16, 2008, and who acquired Debentures in an offering completed in June 2008. The securities class actions generally allege that Constellation, a number of its former officers or directors, and the underwriters violated the securities
laws by issuing a false and misleading registration statement and prospectus in connection with Constellation s June 27, 2008 offering of the Debentures. The securities class actions also allege that Constellation issued false or
misleading statements or was aware of material undisclosed information which contradicted public statements, including in connection with its announcements of financial results for 2007, the fourth quarter of 2007, the first quarter of 2008 and the
second quarter of 2008 and the filing of its first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q. The securities class actions sought, among other things, certification of the cases as class actions, compensatory damages, reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel
fees, and rescission damages.            The Southern District of New
York granted the defendants  motion to transfer the two securities class actions filed in Maryland to the District of Maryland, and the actions have since been transferred for coordination with the securities class action filed there. On
May 9, 2013, the federal court in Maryland preliminarily approved the settlement of Constellation s 2008 Securities Class Action for a payment of $4 million, which will be paid by Constellation s insurer. Notice of the settlement
was provided to class members in June 2013 and the court approved the final settlement on November 4, 2013. This settlement will resolve all of Constellation s litigation arising from the 2008 Securities Class Action lawsuit.   
          Fund Transfer Restrictions (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and
BGE)              Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or
receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.   
        The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or
director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital account  is
undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as: (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed;
  
         408   

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        
   
(2) the dividend is not excessive; and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a
particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.   
        Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless,
among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in
connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt
securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the
subordinated debt securities are issued.            PECO s
Articles of Incorporation prohibit payment of any dividend on, or other distribution to the holders of, common stock if, after giving effect thereto, the capital of PECO represented by its common stock together with its retained earnings is, in the
aggregate, less than the involuntary liquidating value of its then outstanding preferred securities. On May 1, 2013, PECO redeemed all outstanding preferred securities. As a result, the above ratio calculation is no longer applicable.
Additionally, PECO may not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV;
(2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the
subordinated debentures are issued.            BGE pays dividends on
its common stock after its board of directors declares them. However, BGE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by the MDPSC. First, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares through the end of
2014. Second, BGE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE s equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC s ratemaking precedents or
(b) BGE s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. Finally, BGE must notify the MDPSC that it intends to declare a dividend on its common shares at least 30 days
before such a dividend is paid. There are no other limitations on BGE paying common stock dividends unless: (1) BGE elects to defer interest payments on the 6.20% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures due 2043, and any deferred interest
remains unpaid; or (2) any dividends (and any redemption payments) due on BGE s preference stock have not been paid.         
    Baltimore City Franchise Taxes (BGE)           
  The City of Baltimore claims that BGE has maintained electric facilities in the City s public right-of-ways for over one hundred years without
the proper franchise rights from the City. BGE is currently reviewing the merits of this claim. BGE has not recorded an accrual for payment of franchise fees for past periods as a range of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at
this time. Franchise fees assessed in future periods may be material to BGE s results of operations and cash flows.

             The Registrants are involved in various other
litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of
complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible
loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding
the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.             Income Taxes             See

Registrants are determined based on information used by the chief operating decision maker(s) (CODM) in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.            Exelon has nine reportable segments, ComEd, PECO, BGE and Generation s six power marketing reportable segments
consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and all other regions not considered individually significant referred to collectively as  Other Regions  including the South, West and Canada. Generation s
expanded number of reportable segments is the result of the acquisition of Constellation on March 12, 2012. ComEd, PECO and BGE each represent a single reportable segment; as such, no separate segment information is provided for these
Registrants. Exelon evaluates the performance of ComEd, PECO and BGE based on net income.            The CODMs for ComEd, PECO, and BGE evaluate performance and allocate resources for their respective companies based on net income and return on equity for ComEd, PECO, and BGE each as single integrated businesses.

   The foundation of Generation s six reportable segments is based on the geographic location of
its assets, and is largely representative of the footprints of an ISO / RTO and/or NERC region. Descriptions of each of Generation s six reportable segments are as follows:   

Mid-Atlantic  represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the
District of Columbia and parts of North Carolina.            

Midwest  represents operations in the western half of PJM, which includes portions of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, and the
United States footprint of MISO excluding MISO s Southern Region, which covers all or most of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the remaining parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio not covered by PJM, and
parts of Montana, Missouri and Kentucky.            

New England  represents the operations within ISO-NE covering the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.

New York  represents operations within ISO-NY, which covers the state of New York in its entirety.      

ERCOT  represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas, covering most of the state of Texas.      

Other Regions  not considered individually significant:      

South  represents operations in the FRCC, MISO s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM, which
includes all or most of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of Missouri, Kentucky and Texas. Generation s South region also includes operations in the SPP, covering
Kansas, Oklahoma, most of Nebraska and parts of New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.            

West  represents operations in the WECC, which includes California ISO, and covers the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah,
Idaho, Colorado, and parts of New Mexico, Wyoming and South Dakota.            

Canada  represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes the AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.
              The CODMs for Exelon and Generation
evaluate the performance of Generation s power marketing activities and allocate resources based on revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful
measurement of operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information
provided elsewhere in this report. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity
including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation s own generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. Generation s other business activities, including retail and
wholesale gas, upstream natural gas, proprietary trading, energy efficiency and demand response, heating, cooling, and cogeneration facilities, and home improvements, sales of electric and gas appliances, servicing of heating, air conditioning,
plumbing, electrical, and indoor quality systems, and investments in energy-related proprietary technology are not allocated to regions. Further, Generation s compensation under the reliability-must-run rate schedule,

results of operations from the Brandon Shores, Wagner, and C.P. Crane Maryland generating stations, and other miscellaneous revenues, mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, and
amortization of certain intangible assets relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value as a result of the merger are also not allocated to a region.         
  An analysis and reconciliation of the Registrants  reportable segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)        

(a)  
  Generation includes the six power marketing reportable segments shown below: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and Other Regions. Intersegment revenues for
Generation for the year ended December 31, 2013 include revenue from sales to PECO of $405 and sales to BGE of $455 million in the Mid-Atlantic region, and sales to ComEd of $506 in the Midwest region, net of $7 million related to the
unrealized mark-to-market losses related to the ComEd swap, which eliminate upon consolidation. For the year ended December 31, 2012 include revenue from sales to PECO of $543 and sales to BGE of $322 million in the Mid-Atlantic region, and
sales to ComEd of $795 in the Midwest region, net of $7 million related to the unrealized mark-to-market losses related to the ComEd swap, which eliminate upon consolidation. For the year ended 2011 intersegment revenues for Generation include
revenue from sales to PECO of $508 million in the Mid-Atlantic region, and sales to ComEd of $653 million in the Midwest region.     

(c)  
  Other primarily includes Exelon s corporate operations, shared service entities and other financing and investment activities.     

(e)  
  Intersegment revenues exclude sales to unconsolidated affiliates. The intersegment profit associated with Generation s sale of certain products and services by and between
Exelon s segments is not eliminated in consolidation due to the recognition of intersegment profit in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance. For Exelon, these amounts are included in operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.               Generation total revenues:    

(a)

   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE      
         Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE    
        None.         

ITEM 9A.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                  Exelon,   Generation,   ComEd,   PECO and   BGE Disclosure Controls and
Procedures             During the fourth quarter of 2013, each
registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of that registrant s disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting of information in that registrant s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including
its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be included in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as
applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.   
        Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.   
         Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting             Each registrant continually
strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BGE s internal control over financial
reporting.             Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO and BGE Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting             Management is required to
assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2013 and,
therefore, concluded that each registrant s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

         Schedule I   Condensed Financial Information of Parent (Exelon
Corporate)              Notes to Financial Statements
             1. Basis of Presentation    
        Exelon Corporate is a holding company that conducts substantially all
of its business operations through its subsidiaries. These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Rule 12-04, Schedule I of Regulation S-X. These statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Exelon Corporation.            Exelon Corporate owns 100% of all of its significant subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), of which Exelon Corporate owns more than 99%, and BGE, of which
Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of BGE s preferred stock. Exelon owned none of PECO s preference securities, which PECO redeemed in 2013.   
         2. Merger with Constellation    
        On March 12, 2012, Exelon Corporation completed the merger
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, among Exelon, Bolt Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub), and Constellation. As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into Constellation (the Initial Merger) and
Constellation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. Following the completion of the Initial Merger, Exelon and Constellation completed a series of internal corporate organizational restructuring transactions. Constellation merged with and into
Exelon, with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation (the Upstream Merger). Simultaneously with the Upstream Merger, Constellation s interest in RF HoldCo LLC, which holds Constellation s interest in BGE, was transferred to Exelon
Energy Delivery Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon that also owns Exelon s interests in ComEd and PECO. Following the Upstream Merger and the transfer of RF HoldCo LLC, Exelon contributed to Generation certain subsidiaries,
including the customer supply and generation businesses that were acquired from Constellation as a result of the Initial Merger and the Upstream Merger.         
  For BGE s debt, fuel supply contracts and regulatory assets not earning a return, the difference between fair value and book value of
BGE s assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as a regulatory asset at Exelon Corporate as Exelon did not apply push-down accounting to BGE. See Note 4 Merger and Acquisitions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on the merger with Constellation. Also see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on BGE s push-down
accounting treatment.             3. Debt and Credit Agreements    
          Short-Term Borrowings     
        Exelon Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily
through the issuance of commercial paper. Exelon Corporate had no commercial paper borrowings at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.         
    Credit Agreements           
  On August 10, 2013, Exelon Corporate amended and extended its unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of
$500 million through August 10, 2018. As of December 31, 2013, Exelon Corporate had available capacity under those commitments of $498 million. See Note 13 Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding Exelon Corporate s credit agreement.

 Section 1.  Annual Meeting.     The
annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of Directors and for the transaction of general business shall be held on any date as determined year to year by the Board of Directors. The time and location of the meeting shall be determined by
the Board of Directors.    The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, an annual report containing a
full and correct statement of the affairs of the Company, including a balance sheet and a financial statement of operations for the preceding fiscal year, which shall be submitted to the stockholders at the annual meeting.  
 Section 2.  Special Meeting.   
 Special meetings of the stockholders may be held in the City of Baltimore or in any county in which the Company provides service or owns
property upon call by the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, the President, or a majority of the Board of Directors whenever they deem expedient, or upon the written request of the holders of shares entitled to not less than twenty-five
percent of all the votes entitled to be cast at such a meeting. Such request of the stockholders shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on thereat and shall be delivered to the Secretary, who shall
inform such stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing such notice of the meeting, and upon payment to the Company of such costs the Secretary shall give notice stating the purpose or purposes of the meeting to all
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting. No special meeting need be called upon the request of the holders of the shares entitled to cast less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast to such meeting, to consider any matter which is
substantially the same as a matter voted upon at any special meeting of the stockholders held during the preceding twelve months. The business at all special meetings shall be confined to that specifically named in the notice thereof.

secretary of the meeting, unless some other person shall be elected by the meeting to so act. An accurate record of the meeting shall be kept by the secretary thereof, and placed in the record books of the Company.  
 Section 5.  Quorum.     At any
meeting of the stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes thereat shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum be not present at any meeting, holders of a
majority of the shares of stock so present or represented may adjourn the meeting either  sine die  or to a date certain.  
 Section 6.  Voting.     At all
meetings of the stockholders, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock standing in his or her name and, when the preferred or preference stock is entitled to vote, such number of votes as shall be provided in the

and/or a Teller or Tellers to serve at that meeting. It shall be the duty of the Tellers to receive the ballots of all the holders of stock entitled to vote and present at a meeting either in person or by proxy, and to count and tally said ballots
by the official record of stockholders of the Company, or by a summary prepared therefrom and certified by the Stock Transfer Agent or the Secretary of the Company showing the number of shares of common and, if entitled to vote, preferred and
preference stock owned of record by each stockholder, who may be designated therein by name, code number, or otherwise, and certify them to the Judge of Election, and the said Judge shall communicate in writing the result of the balloting so
certified by the Tellers to the chairman who shall at once announce the same to the meeting. This certificate, signed by the Tellers and countersigned by the Judge, shall be duly recorded as part of the minutes of the meeting and filed among the
records of the Company.    Section 8.  Record Date for Stockholders and Closing of Transfer Books.   
 The Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date as the record for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote
at, any meeting of stockholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or entitled to the allotment of any rights, or for any other  
      2  

proper purpose. Such date in any case shall not be more than ninety days (and in the case of a meeting of stockholders not less than ten days) prior to the date on which the particular action
requiring such determination of stockholders is to be taken. Only stockholders of record on such date shall be entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting or to receive such dividends or rights, as the case may be. In lieu of fixing a record
date, the Board of Directors may close the stock transfer books of the Company for a period not exceeding twenty days or less than ten days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders or not exceeding twenty days preceding any other of the
above mentioned events.     ARTICLE II

 Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors from any cause other than by reason of removal by the stockholders or an increase in the
number of Directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors although such majority is less than a quorum. Any vacancy occurring by reason of an increase in the number of Directors may be filled by action of a majority of Directors. A
Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected and qualified.

adjourn to any time and place they may see fit.    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of these bylaws and any provision of law that
otherwise so empowers the Company, the stockholders, the Board of Directors, any Director, any officer or any other person, neither the stockholders nor the Board of Directors nor any Director nor any officer nor any other person shall be authorized
or empowered, nor shall they permit the Company, without the unanimous prior approval of the Board of Directors, including the Independent Directors, to (A) commence any case, proceeding or other action on behalf of the Company under any

ARTICLE 2  
 DEFINITIONS    Section 2.1.
 Defined Terms . As used herein the following words and phrases shall have the following respective meanings when capitalized unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  
 (1)  Administrator . The Company acting through its Vice President, Health   Benefits or such other person

Employer, (c) an organization (whether or not incorporated) that is a member of an affiliated service group (within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code) that includes an Employer, a corporation described in clause (a) of this
subdivision or a trade or business described in clause (b) of this subdivision, or (d) any other entity that is required to be aggregated with an Employer pursuant to Regulations promulgated under Section 414(o) of the Code.  
 (3)  Annuity Starting Date . The first day on which a Service Annuity is payable to a Participant.

produced if the index as defined in the preceding sentence had been used, as determined by the Investment Office.

period of absence and (ii) the number of years of such period of absence from employment is less than five.    (13)

benefits become payable shall be determined as of December 25, 1994 in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as in effect on such date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, solely for purposes of Section 5.6 (relating to Federal
Benefit supplemental payments), the amount of Federal Benefit and the age at which full old age benefits become payable shall be determined at the time of a Participant s Termination of Employment by using the terms of the Federal Social
Security Act as in effect at such time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of Federal Benefit shall be computed (a) with respect to a member of IBEW Local Union 15 whose Termination of Employment occurs on or after
January 1, 2011, by using the Participant s compensation subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (other than the Medicare portion), and (b) with respect to any other Participant, by using an estimated wage history
determined by applying a salary scale based on the actual change in the average national wage from year to year as determined by the Social Security Administration, projected backwards, to the Participant s compensation subject to tax under the
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (other than the Medicare portion) for the calendar year ending immediately prior to the Participant s Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall a Participant s
Federal Benefit be greater than the Federal Benefit determined by using a wage history that assumes the Participant earned no compensation for periods prior to employment with the Company and Affiliates and uses actual compensation paid by the
Company and Affiliates for periods of employment with the Company and Affiliates and, in the case of a Participant who is absent from employment due to employment by a union that represents any group of Employees, uses actual compensation paid by
such union for periods of employment with such union    (22)  Highest Average Annual Pay . The sum of a
Participant s average annual Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay (a) with respect to any Participant who, as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Employment, is not a member of IBEW Local Union 15, during the four

Compensation and Incentive Pay was the highest, or (c) during all years of the Participant s Credited Service if such Credited Service is less than 104 or 78 biweekly pay periods, as applicable. In determining whether a Participant has 104
or 78 consecutive biweekly pay periods, as applicable, any period of uncompensated absence from employment with an Employer, other than an absence due to participation in Military Service shall be disregarded. In computing  Highest Average
Annual Pay,  the total of  
      -7-  

the Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay for a Participant for the applicable consecutive pay periods shall be multiplied, in the case of 104 pay periods by 0.25068654 and in the case of 78 pay
periods by 0.33424872; provided, that in the case of a Participant whose years of Credited Service include fewer than 104 or 78 pay periods, as applicable, the multiplier shall be a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which
is the quotient of (a) the number of 14-day periods during each 365-day period (or if less, during the Participant s Credited Service) and (b) the number of pay periods during the Participant s years of Credited Service. In
addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in computing an Employee s Highest Average Annual Pay, the aggregate amount of the Employee s Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay in excess of the following limits shall not be
taken into account: (i) for Plan Years ending before January 1, 1996, $200,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost of living pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Code for the year in which the computation of Basic Compensation and

(iii) for all Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, $200,000 (adjusted for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17) of the Code). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the limit determined
with respect to clause (i) for the last year for which the computation is made shall be applied for such year and all preceding years. For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1997, the Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay of an Employee
who is a 5% owner of Commonwealth Edison Company or any Affiliate or one of the ten employees of Commonwealth Edison Company and all Affiliates who was paid the greatest compensation (as defined in Section 415 of the Code) for the Plan Year
shall include the Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay of the Employee s spouse and any lineal descendants of the Employee who have not attained age 19 before the close of the Plan Year.

duties (such hours to be credited to the Employee for the computation period or periods in which the duties are performed); (b) each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, on account of a period of time during which no
duties are performed (irrespective of whether a Termination of Employment has occurred) due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty or leave of absence (such hours to be credited to the
Employee for the computation period or periods in which the period of time during which no duties are performed occurs); and (c) each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by an Employer
(such hours to be credited to the Employee for the computation period or periods in which the award or agreement pertains rather than the computation period in which the award, agreement or payment is made). Hours of Service shall be computed in
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 2530.200b-2 of the Department of Labor Regulations.

for the Participant s lifetime and, thereafter, payable in semi-monthly payments in equal shares to each of the Participant s Dependent Minor Children who have not yet attained age 21. The annual amount of the family annuity payable to the
Participant shall be the Participant s annual Service Annuity computed pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities), reduced by the product of (1) the annual amount of the family annuity designated by the Participant for the
Participant s surviving Dependent Minor Child or Children which amount shall be a percentage, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Participant s Service Annuity computed pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities)

semi-monthly payments in equal shares to each of the Participant s Dependent Disabled Children who remain disabled. The annual amount of the surviving dependent s annuity payable to the Participant shall be the Participant s annual
Service Annuity computed pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) reduced by the product of (1) the annual amount of the surviving dependent s annuity designated by the Participant for the Participant s Dependent Disabled
Child or Children, which amount shall be a percentage, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Participant s Service Annuity computed pursuant to Article 5 multiplied by (2) 50% of the applicable
 
      -37-  

factor set forth in Table D, such factor to be determined based on the age of the other parent of such Child or Children, at the Participant s Annuity Starting Date or the age such other
parent would have attained had such other parent survived or if, in either case, the age of such other parent cannot be determined, the age of the Participant. The annual amount of the surviving dependent s annuity payable after the
Participant s death to the Participant s Dependent Disabled Child or Children who remain disabled shall equal the percentage designated by the Participant, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Participant s Service Annuity
computed pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities).    Section 6.3.  Pre-retirement Surviving Spouse Benefit .

Participant (i) had the Participant terminated employment the day before the Participant s death; or (ii) in the case of a Participant who dies before attaining age 55, had the Participant s Service Annuity commenced on the date
the Participant would have attained age 55, in either case, reduced by 2% for each year (computed to the nearest full year), if any, by which the age of such Participant exceeds that of the Participant s surviving Spouse. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, in no event shall the annual amount of the surviving  
      -38-  

spouse annuity computed pursuant to this paragraph (a) of Section 6.3 be less than 50% of the annual amount of the marital annuity, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of
Section 6.1 (relating to annuities payable to married Participants), that would have been payable to such Participant (i) had payment of the Participant s marital annuity commenced the day before the Participant s death or
(ii) in the case of a Participant who dies before attaining age 55, had payment of such marital annuity commenced at age 55 reduced by 1/2% for each month (but not to exceed 120 months) that the Participant s death precedes the date the

payment of such deferred Service Annuity commenced the day before the Participant s death, or (ii) in the case of a Participant who dies before attaining age 50, had payment of the Participant s deferred Service Annuity commenced at
age 50, in either case, reduced by 2% for each year (computed to the nearest full year), if any, by which the age of such Participant exceeds the age of the Participant s surviving Spouse. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event
shall the annual amount of the surviving spouse annuity computed pursuant to this paragraph (b) of Section 6.3 be less than 50% of the annual amount of the marital annuity, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 6.1
(relating to annuities payable to married Participants), that would have been payable to such Participant (i) had payment of the Participant s marital annuity commenced the day before the Participant s death or (ii) in the case

date of the Participant s death, shall be entitled to receive a surviving spouse annuity payable in semi-monthly payments for the surviving Spouse s lifetime  
      -40-  

commencing on or about the first Service Annuity payment date immediately following the later of the date of the Participant s death and the date the Participant would have attained age 65.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the surviving Spouse of a Participant who is described in the preceding sentence and who dies before the Participant s 65th birthday may elect, in writing in the manner specified by the Administrator, to
receive payment of the surviving spouse annuity on any Service Annuity payment date following the later of the date of the Participant s death and the date the Participant would have attained age 60, but in no event later than the first Service

vested termination) that would have been payable to such Participant had payment of such deferred Service Annuity commenced at age 65, in either case, reduced by 2% for each year (computed to the nearest full year), if any, by which the age of such
Participant exceeds the age of the Participant s surviving Spouse. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall the annual amount of the surviving spouse annuity computed pursuant to this paragraph (c) of Section 6.3 be
less than 50% of the annual amount of the marital annuity, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 (relating to annuities payable to married Participants) that would have been payable to such Participant had payment of such

family annuity, all of the Participant s Children have attained age 21 and (ii) in the case of a surviving dependent s annuity, all of the Participant s Children cease to be Dependent Disabled Children. The annual amount of such

Participant to a Service Annuity under Section 5.2 (relating to Normal and Deferred Retirement) or Section 5.3 (relating to Early  
      -42-

the age of the other parent of such Child or Children at the Participant s death or the age such other parent would have attained on such date had such other parent survived or if, in either case, the age of such other parent cannot be
determined, the age shall be deemed to be the same as the Participant.    Section 6.5.  Death Benefits for Spouse or Child of

      -43-  

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Administrator may deliver such notice to the Participant less than 30 days before the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, provided that
(i) the Participant and the Participant s spouse (if any) waive any requirement that such notice be provided no less than 30 days before the Participant s Annuity Starting Date and (ii) payment of the Participant s Service
Annuity commences more than 7 days after such notice is received by the Participant. The notice referred to herein shall mean a notice written in nontechnical language that includes a general description of the benefit forms provided under the Plan,
including the terms and conditions of the basic benefit forms provided under the Plan and the circumstances under which such forms will be provided unless the Participant elects otherwise, with applicable spousal consent, a description of the
eligibility conditions for and any material features of the optional forms of benefit, general information on the relative financial effect upon a Participant s benefit if he elects an optional form of benefit or revokes any prior election, and
a description of the relative value of the optional forms of benefit as compared to a marital annuity. In no event shall payment of a Participant s monthly benefits commence before the notice is made available to the Participant and he has had
an opportunity to make the election described in Section 6.1(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice described in the previous paragraph may be provided to the Participant subsequent to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, if the
Participant so elects, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:    (i) the date the on which the first payment
to be received by the Participant is made (the  initial payment date ) shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early
as the seventh day after such notice is provided if (i) such notice clearly indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided

(iii) the Participant is permitted to revoke such election until the initial payment date;  
      -44-  

(ii) the notice shall be provided to the Participant no more than ninety
(90) days before the initial payment date, however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)- day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;  
 (iii) the Participant is not permitted to elect an Annuity Starting Date that precedes the date upon which the Participant
could have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in effect on the Annuity Starting Date;  
 (iv) to the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for the period from the Annuity Starting Date to the
initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the period beginning on the Annuity Starting Date
and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in the preceding sentence
shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Annuity Starting Date on or after January 1, 2008, the interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in
the sentence above shall be the interest rate as specified or prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, in revenue rulings, notices or other guidance for November of the
preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 7.1 of the Plan, the limitations set forth therein shall comply with the adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with respect to any Annuity Starting Date described in
this paragraph which is a  retroactive annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and  
 (v) if a Participant who is married elects to commence the Participant s benefit as of the initial payment date pursuant
to this paragraph, then the Participant s spouse (including an alternate payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified domestic relations order), determined as of the initial payment date, must consent to such election
if the survivor benefits payable as of the Annuity Starting Date are less than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in Section 6.2(b) of the Plan as of the initial payment date.  
 (b)  Election of Optional Form of Service Annuity . Subject to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided by, this paragraph, a
Participant may, at any time during the 90-day period ending on the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, elect, change or revoke (i) any form of  
      -45-  

Service Annuity provided under this Plan and (ii) the percentage of the Participant s Service Annuity to be paid to a Spouse under a marital annuity, to a Dependent Minor Child under a
family annuity or to a Dependent Disabled Child under a surviving dependent s annuity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the written notice described in paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to the Participant within
30 days of, or after, the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant may make an election, change or revocation as described in the preceding sentence at any time within 30 days after the date the written notice described in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to the Participant. The Participant and the Participant s Spouse, if any, may waive the 30 day period described in the preceding sentence and begin receiving payment of the Participant s
Service Annuity prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, provided that distribution of the Participant s Service Annuity commences more than 7 days after the notice described in paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to
the Participant. An election, change or revocation described in this paragraph (b) shall be made by delivering a written notice describing the election, change or revocation to the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Participant is married on the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant s election to receive an optional form of Service Annuity under Section 6.2 (relating to optional Service Annuity forms) in lieu of the marital annuity
described in paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 (relating to annuities payable to married Participants) shall not be effective unless (i) it shall have been consented to at the time of such election in writing by the Participant s
Spouse and such consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by either a Plan representative or a notary public, or (ii) it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that such consent cannot be obtained
because the Participant s Spouse cannot be located or because of such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. An  
      -46-  

election of an optional Service Annuity form shall be deemed a rejection of the basic Service Annuity form provided in Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment).
The consent of a Spouse required by this paragraph shall not be necessary for a distribution required by a qualified domestic relations order described in paragraph (b) of Section 13.2.  
 (c)  Automatic Cancellation of Elections . If a Participant s Service Annuity is payable in the form of a marital annuity and if,
prior to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant s spouse dies or the Participant and such spouse divorce, the Participant s election or deemed election to receive a marital annuity shall, upon the Participant s
notice to the Administrator of such death or divorce, be automatically cancelled, unless, subsequent to such spouse s death or the Participant s divorce and prior to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant remarries
and notice of such new marriage is timely received by the Administrator.    If a Participant s Service Annuity is payable in the form
of a marital annuity and if, after the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant s Spouse predeceases the Participant or the Participant s Spouse, pursuant to a duly entered divorce decree, specifically relinquishes all
rights to receive any Service Annuity in the event of the Participant s death, the Participant s Service Annuity shall be recomputed prospectively as if the Participant were not married on the Annuity Starting Date. Any marriage by the
Participant after the Participant s Annuity Starting Date shall not affect the payment of the Participant s Service Annuity or require any payment to the Participant s new spouse.  
 If a Participant has elected to receive a family annuity and, either before or after payment of such annuity commences, all of the
Participant s previously Dependent Minor Children have predeceased the Participant or have ceased to be dependent, within the meaning of Section 152 of the Code, the Participant s election to receive a family annuity shall, upon the
Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or cessation of being a dependent, be automatically cancelled.  
      -47-  

If a Participant has elected to receive a surviving dependent s annuity and either before or
after payment of such annuity commences, all of the Participant s previously Dependent Disabled Children have predeceased the Participant or have ceased to be Dependent Disabled Children, as certified by the medical director of the Company or
by such other licensed physician designated by the Company, the Participant s election to receive a surviving dependent s annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or cessation of being a
Dependent Disabled Child, be automatically cancelled.    A Participant whose election has been automatically cancelled pursuant to this
paragraph (c) shall be entitled to receive the Service Annuity described in Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment) or, in the case of an election that is automatically cancelled prior to the Participant s
Annuity Starting Date and subject to Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment), such other form of Service Annuity described in Section 6.2 (relating to optional Service Annuity forms) for which the Participant is
eligible and elects in accordance with this Section 6.6.    Section 6.7.  Lump Sum Payment . Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if the monthly amount of any Service Annuity shall initially be or at any time become $10 or less, the Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree may, in lieu of such annuity, elect to receive, and within 30 days after such election there
shall be paid to such Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree, an amount equal to the lump sum equivalent of such annuity calculated on the basis of the  applicable interest rate  as defined in Section 417 of the Code and the Regulations

specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3)    of the Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan
Year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of computing single sum payments on or after December 1, 2012, other than under Section 6.9 (relating to Special Lump Sum Payment Option),
(i) the interest rate used shall be the interest rate as defined in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the fifth month (or, if more favorable to the recipient of a single sum payment between December 1, 2012 and December 1,
2013), the second month) preceding the calendar year in which such distribution is made or commences and (ii) the mortality table shall be the mortality table specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of
Section 417(e)(3) of the Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.    In the case
of a distribution pursuant to this Section 6.7 that is an  eligible rollover distribution  within the meaning of Section 402 of the Code and that is at least $200, an eligible distributee (as defined below) may elect that all or

the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term  Spouse  shall include the Participant s surviving Spouse and the Participant s Spouse or former Spouse who is
the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order. In addition, in the case of a distribution that occurs on or after January 1, 2008, a Beneficiary who is not the Spouse of the Participant may elect that all or any portion of such

Section 7.2.  Temporary Restrictions on Benefits in Case of Termination or
Curtailment . This Section 7.2 sets forth restrictions required by the Internal Revenue Service on the Service Annuity payable for a Plan Year to a highly compensated employee or highly compensated former employee, as described in
Section 414(q) of the Code and Regulations who is among the twenty-five highest paid nonexcludable employees in the service of the Employers for the Plan Year. The restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 shall not become applicable if:
   (1) after payment to such highly compensated employee of any Service Annuity, the value of Plan assets equals or exceeds
110 percent of the value of current liabilities (as defined in Section 412(l)(7) of the Code),    (2) the value of the
Service Annuity paid to such highly compensated employee is less than one percent of the value of current liabilities of the Plan, or  
 (3) the value of the Service Annuity payable to or on behalf of such highly compensated employee does not exceed the amount
described in Section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code.    If the Service Annuity payable to a Participant is subject to the restrictions set
forth in this Section 7.2, the Service Annuity provided from the Plan shall not exceed the payments that would be made on behalf of such Participant under a single life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the sum of the
Participant s Service Annuity and the Participant s other benefits under the Plan.    The foregoing conditions do not restrict the
full payment of any death or survivor s benefits on behalf of a Participant who dies while the Plan is in full effect and its full current costs have been met.  
 Any amounts that become due but because of the limitations of this Section 7.2, if applicable, cannot be made available to or for the
Participant (either currently or later) shall be applied to reduce subsequent contributions of the Employers; but if the Employers have ceased contributions to the Plan, such amounts shall be applied for the benefit of Participants not affected by
this Section 7.2 in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner.  
      -58-  

This Section 7.2 is inserted solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Service and shall not be applied except to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements.    Section 7.3
 Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding . (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s  Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage  (the
 AFTAP ), as defined in Section 436(j) of the Code, is at or below the following levels.    (i) If the
Plan s AFTAP is 60% or greater but less than 80% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment (as defined in subsection 7.3(a)(iv) below) after the valuation date for the Plan Year to the extent the amount of the payment
exceeds the lesser of (x) 50% of the amount of the payment which could be made without regard to the restrictions under this subsection 7.3 and (y) the present value (determined pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under Section 417(e) of the Code) of the maximum guarantee with respect to the Participant under Section 4022 of ERISA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, only one
such prohibited payment may be made with respect to any Participant during any period of consecutive Plan Years to which the limitations under either clause (x) or (y) of the preceding sentence apply. For purposes of this subsection
7.3(a)(i), a Participant, his Beneficiary and any alternate payee (as defined in Section 414(p)(8) of the Code) shall be deemed a single  Participant.   
 (ii) If the Plan s AFTAP is less than 60% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment after the
valuation date for the Plan Year.    (iii) During any period in which the Company is a debtor in a case under Title 11,
United States Code (or similar federal or state law), the Plan shall not make any prohibited payment. The preceding sentence shall not apply on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the AFTAP is not less than
100%.    (iv) For purposes of this subsection 7.3(a), the term  prohibited payment  means (x) any payment, in
excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any supplements described in Section 6.2), to a Participant or Beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in Section 417(f)(2) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) occurs during any period a limitation under subsection 7.3(a)(ii) or (iii) is in effect, (y) any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or (z) any other payment
specified by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.  
      -59-  

(b) In any Plan Year in which the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60%, benefit
accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the valuation date for the Plan Year. This restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a
contribution (in addition to any minimum required contribution under Section 430 of the Code) equal to the amount sufficient to result in an AFTAP of 60%.  
 (c) No amendment which has the effect of increasing Plan liabilities by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits,
changing the rate of benefit accruals or the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect during any Plan Year if the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 80% or would be less than 80% after taking into account such
amendment; provided, however, that the preceding restriction shall not apply to an amendment which provides for an increase in benefits under a formula which is not based on a Participant s compensation if the rate of such increase is not in
excess of the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of Participants covered by the amendment; and provided, further, that such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year
(or if later, the effective date of the amendment), upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a contribution as described in Section 436(c)(2) of the Code.  
 (d) The Plan shall not provide an unpredictable contingent event benefit payable with respect to any event occurring during any Plan Year if
the AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60% or would be less than 60% after taking into account such occurrence; provided, however, such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan
Year, upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a  
      -60-  

contribution as described in Section 436(b)(2) of the Code. For purposes of this subsection 7.3(d), the term  unpredictable contingent event benefit  means any benefit payable
solely by reason of a plant shutdown (or similar event, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), or any event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or occurrence of death
or disability.    (e) To avoid benefit restrictions, the Company may take any action permitted by Section 436 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.    (f) The provisions of this subsection 7.3 are intended to comply with Section 436 of the Code
and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall be construed to comply therewith.    ARTICLE 8  
 SERVICE ANNUITY FUND    The Service
Annuity Fund is the Service Annuity Fund created by the Company for the payment of Service Annuities. All contributions under this Plan shall be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall hold all monies and other property received by it and shall
invest and reinvest the same, together with the income therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the directions of the Investment Office. The Investment Office shall be a  named fiduciary  under the Plan for
purposes of ERISA and, as such, may, in its discretion, delegate to one or more investment managers, as defined in ERISA, the authority to hold, manage, acquire and dispose of all or any part of the Service Annuity Fund. Any investment manager

      -61-  

common, collective or commingled trust qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) and exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code which is maintained by such investment
manager ( common trust ). During such period of time as all or any portion of the Service Annuity Fund shall be invested in a common trust, the trust document governing such common trust shall govern any investment therein and such trust
document shall be a part hereof. Investment of the common trust in deposits of the trustee of the common trust is hereby expressly authorized.  
 In addition, the Investment Office is authorized and empowered to direct the Trustee as to the investment and reinvestment all or any part of
the Service Annuity Fund in the Commonwealth Edison Pooled Fund (the  Pooled Fund ). During such period of time as all or any portion of the Service Annuity Fund is invested in the Pooled Fund, the trust document governing the Pooled Fund
shall govern any investment therein and such trust document shall be a part hereof. On and after November 1, 2010, the Service Annuity Fund shall be invested in the Exelon Corporation Pension Master Retirement Trust (the  Master
Trust ), which is an amendment and restatement of the Pooled Fund, and the Master Trust document shall govern any investment therein. The Investment Office may delegate to one or more investment managers, as defined in ERISA, the authority to
hold, manage, acquire and dispose of all or any part of the Service Annuity Fund invested in the Pooled Fund or, on and after November 1, 2010, in the Master Trust.

described in either of the following paragraphs, receiving, or eligible to begin receiving, a Service Annuity may be employed in any business, including that of an Employer or an Affiliate, without in any way affecting the payment to him or her of
his or her Service Annuity, provided however, that if he or she is employed by an Employer or an Affiliate, such employment satisfies the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits as set forth in the Company s
policy regarding the rehiring of retirees.    A retired bargaining unit Employee or former bargaining unit Employee, if such bargaining unit
Employee was a member of Local Union 15 (or a predecessor union), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, receiving a Service Annuity may be employed in any business, other than that of the Company, without in any way affecting the payment
to him or her of his or her Service Annuity. Such retired bargaining unit Employee, or former bargaining unit Employee, receiving a Service Annuity may be employed in the temporary service of an Employer or an Affiliate, but, except as otherwise
provided in paragraph (b) of Section 5.2, during the term of such employment, he or she shall not receive any Service Annuity payments unless such employment is for less than 40 Hours of Service per calendar month. Upon the conclusion of
such temporary service employment, Service Annuity payments shall again be made to him or her, as described in Section 9.4 (relating to suspension of Service Annuities).  
      -63-  

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a retired Employee or former Employee

Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan or the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees or any plan sponsored by CEG shall not, under any circumstances, have the right to elect to participate in this Plan.  
 Section 9.2.  Social Security Increases . The Service Annuity of a Retiree or a Participant who has terminated employment under
circumstances that entitle the Participant to a deferred Service Annuity under Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested termination) shall not be recomputed to reflect any change in the benefit levels payable under Title II of the Federal
Social Security Act or any change in the wage base under such Title II if such change takes place after the earlier of the date payment of such Service Annuity commences or the date of such termination, as the case may be.  
 Section 9.3.  Leased Employees . A leased employee (within the meaning of section 414(n)(2) of the Code) shall not be eligible to
participate in the Plan. If a person who performed services as a leased employee (as defined below) of any Employer or Affiliate becomes an Employee, or if an Employee becomes such a leased employee, then any period during which such services were
so performed shall be taken into account solely for the purposes of determining whether and when such person is eligible to participate in this Plan under  
      -64-  

Article 3 (relating to participation), measuring such person s years of Vesting Service and determining when such person has terminated his or her employment for purposes of
Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) and Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms) to the same extent it would have been had such service been as an Employee. In addition, any contributions or benefits provided under another plan to
such leased employee by his or her leasing organization shall be treated as provided under this Plan and shall be taken into account under Section 7.1 to the extent required under Section 1.415(a)-1(f)(3) of the Regulations. This
Section 9.3 shall not apply to any period of service during which such a leased employee was covered by a plan described in Section 414(n)(5) of the Code and during which the total number of leased employees did not constitute more than
20% of the Employer s non-highly compensated work force within the meaning of Section 414(n)(1)(C)(ii) of the Code. For purposes of this Plan, a  leased employee  shall mean any person who is not an employee of an Employer and
who pursuant to an agreement between an Employer or Affiliate has performed services for an Employer or an Affiliate on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least one year, which services were performed under the primary direction or
control of an Employer or an Affiliate.    Section 9.4.  Suspension of Service Annuities . (a) Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Plan to the contrary and except as provided in paragraph (b) of Section 5.2 (relating to special rule for Participants who attain age 70-1/2 while employed), a Participant who remains an Employee after the
Participant s Normal Retirement Age without having any Termination of Employment that results in the Participant beginning to receive his or her Service Annuity shall not be entitled to receive any Service Annuity for any calendar month of
employment by an Employer or an Affiliate during which the Participant completes at least 40 Hours  
      -65-  

of Service. If the Service Annuity payments of a Participant described in the preceding sentence or a Participant described in either of the second or third paragraph of Section 9.1
(relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity System) are suspended, then such payments shall resume at the earlier of (i) such Participant s actual retirement, or (ii) such Participant s ceasing to work 40 Hours
of Service or more per calendar month. A Participant s Service Annuity payments which have been suspended pursuant to this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity System) shall be
resumed not later than the third calendar month after the calendar month in which the Participant ceases to be employed as described in the preceding sentence. The initial payment upon resumption of the Service Annuity payments shall include any
amounts withheld during the period between the cessation of the period during which his or her Service Annuity was suspended and the resumption of payments, but shall not be actuarially adjusted for such delay in resumption of his or Service Annuity
nor shall any Service Annuity payment be made with respect to any month during which his or her Service Annuity was suspended pursuant to this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity
System).    (b) No Service Annuity shall be suspended under this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after
commencement of Service Annuity System) unless the Participant is notified by personal delivery or first class mail during the first calendar month or payroll period in which the Service Annuity is being suspended. Such notice will contain such
information as may from time to time be required by Section 2530.203-3(b)(4) of the regulations of the Department of Labor or any amendment thereto.  
      -66-  

(c) If a Participant erroneously receives Service Annuity payments for a month during which such
payments should have been suspended pursuant to this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity System), then the Administrator may deduct from future Service Annuity payments such erroneously
received payments. However, no such deduction may exceed in any one month 25 percent of that month s payment to which the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary, as the case may be, would have been entitled.  
 Section 9.5.  Reemployment Before Commencement of Service Annuity . (a)  Employees Represented by IBEW Local Union 15 .
The following rules shall apply to an Eligible Employee who is a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 who incurs a Termination of Employment and who is rehired by an Employer prior to commencing his or her

the Plan as of his or her rehire date or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his or her employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant.  
 (ii)  Rehire Date After Absence of at Least 5 Years . If an Eligible Employee terminates employment, regardless of whether
such Eligible Employee was a Participant on the date that his or her employment terminated, and is later rehired by an Employer after having an absence from employment with the Employers and their Affiliates of at least five years and, on the date
of such Employee s rehire, the Employee is a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, such Eligible Employee shall (A) if he or she was a Participant with a vested Service Annuity as of his or her
termination date, become a Participant as of his or her rehire date, (B) if he or she was not a Participant as of his or her termination date and was a participant entitled to a vested benefit under the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for
Bargaining Unit Employees as of his or her termination date, he or she shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant, or (C) if he or she was neither a  
      -67-

then an Eligible Employee or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his or her employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant. Notwithstanding clause (1) of the
preceding sentence, if an Eligible Employee described in the preceding sentence was not at any time permitted to make the election described in Section 3.2(a) or was permitted to make such election and elected to participate in the Exelon

      -68-  

(ii)  Rehire Date After Absence of at Least 5 Years . If an Employee

order is issued,    (ii) this Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial equivalence), or  
 (iii) the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which at the time such order is issued already are required to be paid to a
different alternate payee under a prior qualified domestic relations order; and    (C) does not require the payment of
benefits to any alternate payee before the first to occur of (i) the earliest date as of which payment of the Participant s Service Annuity could commence after his or her Termination of Employment, and (ii) the Participant s
attainment of age 50,    all as determined by the Company pursuant to the procedures contained in Section 10.3 (relating to procedures for domestic
relations orders). Any amounts subject to a domestic relations order prior to determination of its status as a qualified domestic relations order which but for such order would be paid to the Participant shall be segregated in a separate account or
an escrow account pending such determination. If, within a reasonable time after receipt of written evidence of such order by the Company, it is determined that a domestic relations order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order, the amount
so segregated (plus any interest thereon) shall be paid to the alternate payee in accordance with the terms of the order. If, within a reasonable time after receipt of a domestic relations order by the Company, it is determined that a domestic
relations order does not constitute a qualified domestic relations order, then the amount so segregated (plus any interest thereon) shall, as soon as practicable, be paid to the Participant. Any subsequent determination that such order constitutes a
qualified domestic relations order shall apply only to payments made on or after the date of such subsequent determination.

Section 13.3.  Employment Non-Contractual . Neither this Plan nor any action taken by
the Administrator or the Investment Office confers any right upon any Employee to continue in employment with any Employer.  
 Section 13.4.  Limitation of Rights . No Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree shall have any right, title, interest or claim in or to
any part of the Service Annuity Fund at any time, but shall have the right only to distributions from the Service Annuity Fund on the terms and conditions herein provided. Neither this Plan nor any action taken by the Administrator or the Investment
Office shall obligate any Employer to make contributions to the Service Annuity Fund in excess of the contributions authorized by the board of directors of the Company or create any liability on an Employer for the payment of Service Annuities under
this Plan.    Section 13.5.  Merger or Consolidation with or Transfer to Another Plan . A merger or consolidation with, or
transfer of assets or liabilities to, any other Plan shall not be effected unless the terms of such merger, consolidation or transfer are such that each Participant, Beneficiary, Retiree or other person entitled to receive benefits from this Plan
would, if this Plan were to terminate immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer, receive a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit such person would be entitled to receive if this Plan were to terminate immediately before the
merger, consolidation, or transfer.    If an Employee or a group of Employees ceases to be an Employee or Employees of an Employer and
becomes an employee or employees of an Affiliate that is not an Employer but that maintains its own pension plan, there shall be transferred from the Service Annuity Fund to the trust fund for the pension plan of such Affiliate assets in an amount
equal to the proportion of the amount of the total assets of the Service Annuity Fund, after deducting therefrom the  
      -89-  

amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to all Retirees and Participants, which the actuarial reserve allocable to such
Employee or such group of Employees, as the case may be, bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all Employees. If, however, any such group of Employees shall include all of the Employees of all Employers, all of the assets of the Service
Annuity Fund shall be so transferred.    If and when a separate pension plan and trust fund is created by the Company for supervisory,
administrative and management Employees, there shall be transferred from the Service Annuity Fund to such separate trust fund assets in an amount equal to the sum of (a) that proportion of the amount of the total assets of the Service Annuity
Fund, after deducting therefrom the amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to all Retirees and Participants, which the actuarial reserve allocable to such supervisory,
administrative and management Employees bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all Employees, and (b) the amount of assets actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to Retirees
who were supervisory, administrative or management Employees at the time of the granting of such Service Annuities. If and when an Employee shall thereafter be transferred to or from the management payroll, there shall be transferred from the
Service Annuity Fund to such separate trust fund or from such separate trust fund to the Service Annuity Fund, as the case may be, assets in an amount determined in the same manner as described in the preceding sentence (and the Employee s
Service Annuity or benefits in the nature of a service annuity shall subsequently be paid out of the Service Annuity Fund or such separate trust fund, as the case may be).  
      -90-  

If and when an employee or a group of employees of an Affiliate that is not an Employer shall
cease to be an employee or employees of such Affiliate and shall become an Employee or Employees of an Employer, the Trustee under the Service Annuity Fund shall accept, upon transfer from the trust fund of the pension plan of such Affiliate, assets
in an amount equivalent to that proportion of the amount of the total assets of such trust fund, after deducting therefrom the amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of benefits theretofore granted, which the actuarial
reserve allocable to such Employee or such groups of Employees, as the case may be, bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all employees. If, however, any such group of Employees shall include all of the employees of such Affiliate, all of the
assets of such trust fund shall be so accepted.    In the case of each transfer of assets made or accepted pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 13.5, the amount of the total assets and (if less than all assets are to be transferred) the proportion thereof to be transferred shall be determined as of a date not earlier than December 31 of the preceding calendar year.
   All assets accepted, upon transfer, by the Trustee under the Service Annuity Fund, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 13.5,
shall be held and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement relating to the Service Annuity Fund.  
 Section 13.6.  Medical Examination . A Participant or Beneficiary for whom a determination or verification of physical or medical
condition is in the opinion of the Administrator relevant to the application of this Plan shall, if and when reasonably requested by the Administrator, submit to medical examination by a physician appointed by the Administrator.  
 Section 13.7.  Applicable Law . Except to the extent preempted by applicable federal law or otherwise provided under the terms of
the Plan, the Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.  
      -91-  

Section 13.8.  Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan . Except for actions
to which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413 of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant
receives a final decision from the Chief Human Resources Officer (or such other officer designated from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and
(b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be
interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal
or equitable action against any party.    Section 13.9.  Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan . Any legal action involving the
Plan that is brought by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the federal courts located in the Northern District of Illinois or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whichever is most convenient, and no other
federal or state court.    Section 13.10.  Legal Fees . Any award of legal fees in connection with an action involving the Plan
shall be calculated pursuant to a method that results in the lowest amount of fees being paid, which amount shall be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to (a) administrative
proceedings under the Plan, (b) unsuccessful claims brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or (c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be no enhancement for the
risk of contingency, nonpayment or any other risk nor shall there be applied  
      -92-  

a contingency multiplier or any other multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the Administrator, the Investment Office, the Corporate
Investment Committee, any Plan fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, any Plan administrator, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan Parties ), legal fees of the Plan
Parties in connection with such action shall be paid by the Participant, Beneficiary or other person bringing the action, unless the court specifically finds that there was a reasonable basis for the action.  
 ARTICLE 14    TOP-HEAVY PLAN
REQUIREMENTS    Section 14.1.  Top-Heavy Plan Determination . If, as of the determination date (as hereinafter defined) for any
Plan Year, the aggregate present value of (a) the accrued Service Annuities under this Plan and the accrued benefits under all other defined benefit plans in the aggregation group (as defined below) and (b) the aggregate account balances
under all defined contribution plans in such aggregation group, in each case with respect to all participants in such plans who are key employees (as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code) for such Plan Year, exceeds 60% of the aggregate of the
present value of the Service Annuities, accrued benefits and account balances of all participants in such plans as of the determination date, then this Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year, and the requirements of Section 14.2
(relating to minimum benefit for top-heavy years), Section 14.3 (relating to top-heavy vesting requirements) and Section 14.4 (relating to special rules for applying statutory limitations on benefits) shall be applicable for such Plan Year
as of the first day thereof. An employee s compensation, as defined in Section 1.415(c)-2 of the Regulations, from the Company and its Affiliates for a Plan Year shall be used, where applicable, in determining whether such employee is a
key employee.  
      -93-  

For purposes of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph, for any Plan Year, the Service
Annuity accrued in respect of any Employee shall be the amount calculated as of the determination date, and the present value of such amount shall be based on the actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial valuation as of such determination date.
The calculation of the present value of the Service Annuity accrued in respect of any Employee shall be subject to adjustments required under Section 416 of the Code.  
 If this Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for any Plan Year and not be a top-heavy plan for any subsequent Plan Year, the requirements of this
Article shall not be applicable for such subsequent Plan Year except to the extent provided in Section 14.3 (relating to top-heavy vesting requirements).  
 For purposes of this Article, (a) the aggregation group shall consist of (i) if a key employee was a Participant in this Plan during
the Plan Year containing the determination date (defined below) or any of the four preceding Plan Years, then this Plan and each other plan of an Employer which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and in which a key employee is a
participant during any of such Plan Years, (ii) this Plan and each other plan which enables this Plan to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or 410(b) of the Code during the Plan Year containing the determination date (defined
below) or any of the four preceding Plan Years, and (iii) this Plan and each other plan of an Employer which it shall so designate and which together with this Plan shall satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code;
(b) the determination date for all plans in the aggregation group shall be the last day of the preceding plan year; and (c) the valuation date applicable to a determination date shall be (i) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the
date as of which the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan year including the determination date is prepared, and (ii) in the case of a defined contribution plan,  
      -94-  

the date as of which account balances are determined which is coincident with or immediately precedes the determination date, except that if any such plan specifies a different determination or
valuation date, such different date shall be used with respect to such plan. For the purpose of determining the Service Annuity, accrued benefit or account balance of a participant, any person who received a distribution from a plan in the
aggregation group during the one-year period ending on the last day of the preceding plan year shall be treated as a participant in such plan, and any such distribution shall be included in such participant s Service Annuity, accrued benefit or
account balance as the case may be, except that in the case of any distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death or disability, this sentence shall be applied by substituting  five-year period  for the
 one-year period  stated herein.    Section 14.2.  Minimum Benefit for Top-Heavy Years . (a) Subject to paragraph
(b) of this Section 14.2 and the applicable reductions set forth in Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) and Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms), the annual amount of Service Annuity on a single life basis to which an
eligible employee (other than an eligible employee who is a key employee as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code) is entitled at age 65 under Section 5.2 (relating to normal and deferred retirement), Section 5.3 (relating to early
retirement), Section 5.4 (relating to disability retirement at or after age 45), Section 5.5 (relating to disability retirement before age 45) or Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested termination) shall in no event be less than
(i) the product of (A) 2% of such eligible employee s average compensation, as described in Section 416(c) of the Code, from the Company and its Affiliates during such eligible employee s five highest-paid consecutive
calendar years of service beginning after January 1, 1983 and while the Plan is top-heavy, multiplied by (B) the number of such eligible employee s years of Credited Service (but not in excess of ten) ending after
 
      -95-  

December 31, 1983 while the Plan is top-heavy less (ii) the annual actuarial equivalent of the eligible employee s vested portion of such eligible employee s account balances
attributable to employer contributions and forfeitures, and earnings and losses thereon (including prior distributions thereof) and accrued benefits to which such eligible employee is entitled on Termination of Employment under all other qualified
plans maintained by the Company or its Affiliates.    For purposes of this Article 14 (relating to top-heavy plan requirements),
 eligible employee  shall mean any employee other than an employee who is included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and an Employer, if there is evidence that retirement
benefits have been the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such Employer.    (b) The provisions of
paragraph (a) shall not apply with respect to an eligible employee if, for each year in which this Plan is top-heavy, (i) the eligible employee s Employer also maintains a defined contribution plan which is included in the aggregation
group for such year, and (ii) contributions made on behalf of each eligible employee other than key employees and forfeitures allocated to such eligible employee during such Plan Year are at least 5% of such eligible employee s
compensation.    Section 14.3.  Top-Heavy Vesting Requirements . Not-withstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if
an eligible employee s Termination of Employment occurs during a Plan Year in which this Plan is top-heavy and after the eligible employee has completed at least two years of Vesting Service but before the eligible employee has completed five
years of Vesting Service, or after this Plan has been top-heavy and during the time this Plan was top-heavy such eligible employee has completed three years of Vesting Service, then such eligible  
      -96-  

employee shall be entitled, subject to Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms) and Article 7 (relating to limitation on benefits), to receive, determined in accordance with the
following table, the vested percentage of the eligible employee s Service Annuity computed pursuant to Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested termination):      
   Section 14.4.  Special Rules for Applying Statutory Limitations on Benefits . In any Plan Year for
which this Plan is top-heavy, clauses (C)(I) and (D)(I) of the first paragraph of Section 7.1 (relating to maximum annual benefits) shall be applied by substituting  100%  for  125%  appearing therein unless, for such Plan
Year (i) the percentage of Service Annuities accrued by Participants who are key employees does not exceed 90% of the Service Annuities accrued by all Participants, and (ii) the minimum accrued benefit of each Participant under all defined
benefit plans in the aggregation group is at least 3% of such Participant s average compensation multiplied by each year of such Participant s Credited Service after 1983, not in excess of 10, while such plans are top-heavy.  
 ARTICLE 15    AMENDMENT AND
TERMINATION    Section 15.1.  Amendment . The board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) may at any time and from
time to time amend or modify this Plan in any manner deemed by the board of directors of the Company to be necessary or desirable, provided, however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate
 
      -97-  

annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the
case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater responsibility and, provided,
further, that no amendment shall be made that affects Employees who are represented by IBEW Local Union 15 that is not consistent with that portion of the Company s collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan.
Any such amendment or modification shall become effective on such date as the board of directors of the Company shall determine and may apply to Participants in this Plan at the time thereof as well as to future Participants, provided, however, that
no such amendment or modification which reduces the basis for the computation of Service Annuities shall be retroactive as to service prior to the date of such amendment or modification.  
 In addition, the Administrator may amend or modify subdivision (4) of Section 2.1 (relating to the definition of Basic Compensation)
and subdivision (24) of Section 2.1 (relating to the definition of Incentive Pay) by changing such subdivisions as described therein.  
 Section 15.2.  Establishment of Separate Plan . If an Employer shall withdraw from this Plan under Section 11.2 (relating to
withdrawal from participation), the Investment Office shall determine the portion of the Service Annuity Fund held by the Trustee which is applicable to the Participants and Retirees of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate such portion
in a separate trust. Such separate trust shall thereafter be held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.  
      -98-  

Section 15.3.  Termination of the Plan by an Employer . The Company may at any time, by
resolution adopted by its board of directors, terminate this Plan in its entirety. In addition, any Employer may at any time terminate its participation in this Plan by resolution adopted by its board of directors to that effect. If the Internal
Revenue Service shall refuse to issue an initial favorable determination letter that this Plan and the Service Annuity Fund as adopted by the Company meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the Service Annuity Fund is
exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, any Employer may terminate its participation in this Plan and direct the Trustee to pay and deliver to that Employer the portion of the Service Annuity Fund applicable to its contributions.  
 Section 15.4.  Distribution upon Termination or Partial Termination . Upon termination or partial termination of this Plan, the
Service Annuities accrued as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case may be, of all affected Participants shall be fully vested. After providing for any expenses of the termination of this Plan, or, in the event of the partial
termination of this Plan, any expenses of such partial termination which are to be borne by the portion of the Service Annuity Fund applicable to those Employees affected by the partial termination, the remainder of such portion of the Service
Annuity Fund (the  asset value ) shall be allocated pursuant to the priority categories set forth in Section 4044 of ERISA and PBGC Regulations. In the event that after the termination of this Plan there is any asset value remaining
after such allocation, the assets representing such asset value shall be paid over and applied for the benefit of the Employees of the Employers. The portion of the asset value allocated to provide Service Annuities to any person or group of persons
may be applied for the benefit of such person or persons by the distribution of cash, continuance of the Service Annuity Fund, establishment of a new trust fund, purchase of annuities from an insurance company, or otherwise, as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if the Plan is terminated, the Service Annuity of each highly compensated employee as defined in Section 414(q) of the Code (and any former highly compensated employee) is
limited to a Service Annuity that is nondiscriminatory under Section 401(a)(4) of the Code.  
      -99-  

Section 15.5.  Trust to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their
Beneficiaries . Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.2 (relating to return of contributions), Section 15.3 (relating to termination of the Plan by an Employer), Section 15.4 (relating to distribution upon termination or
partial termination of the Plan) and any other provision of this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Service Annuity Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for the exclusive benefit of
Participants and their Beneficiaries either by operation or termination of this Plan, power of amendment or other means.

  Eligible Participant . A Participant (i) whose employment with the Employers is terminated other than for Cause as a result of either (A) his or her Employer s restructuring related to the merger or
pending merger of Unicom Corporation and PECO Energy or (B) the Participant s rejection of an offer of a Significant Transfer, (ii) who is notified that his or her Termination Date shall occur on or before December 31, 2002 and

B. 
  Eligible Participants who are Age 50 with at Least 5, but Less than 10, Years of Credited Service . Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, if an Eligible Participant, after taking into

 2.8 Pension Choice Election.  
 (a) In General. Each Participant who is, as of January 1, 2002, an Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the
time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (i) continue participating in the Plan on and after January 1, 2002 or (ii) cease participating in the Plan as of December 31, 2001 and begin participating in the Exelon
Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan as of January 1, 2002. Each Eligible Employee who elects to continue participating in the Plan or who is offered and fails to make any such election shall continue to be a Participant as of January 1,
2002. Each Eligible Employee who elects to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan in lieu of participation in this Plan shall cease participation in the Plan as of December 31, 2001 and shall not be entitled to any
benefit under the Plan, unless such Participant receives a notification (the  Notice ) from the Company that his employment with the Company and the Affiliates will be terminated on or before December 31, 2002 and that such
Participant is eligible for benefits under Article IVE of the Plan or any severance plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate. An Eligible Employee who receives a Notice shall continue to be a Participant in the Plan until his Separation from
 
      12  

Service, notwithstanding such Eligible Employee s election to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan. An Eligible Employee (i) who receives a Notice, but whose
employment does not terminate on or before December 31, 2002, or (ii) whose employment terminates before December 31, 2002 without the Employee receiving a Notice, shall cease participation in the Plan as of December 31, 2001 if
such Employee elects, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan.  
 Effective as of January 1, 2004, each Eligible Employee who (i) was eligible to participate in the Plan as of
December 31, 2000, (ii) ceases to be a Power Team Employee as of January 1, 2004 because such Eligible Employee is no longer eligible to participate in the performance share award program for Power Team employees under the Exelon
Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan and (iii) did not previously make a valid election pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Committee, to either (i) participate in the
Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan in lieu of this Plan as of January 1, 2004 or (ii) continue or resume participation in the Plan as of January 1, 2004. Each such Eligible Employee who affirmatively elects to continue or
resume participation in this Plan in lieu of participation in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan shall continue or resume participation in this Plan as of January 1, 2004.  
 (b) Transfer of Benefits and Assets to Cash Balance Pension Plan. If an Eligible Employee described in paragraph (a) above
elects to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan in lieu of participating in the Plan, the Employee s pension, determined as of December 31, 2001, or December 31, 2003, as the case may be, based on the
Employee s Benefit Years, Compensation and average annual base salary as of such date, shall be transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan, and such Employee shall not accrue any additional benefit under the Plan. An amount
of assets that is equal to the present value of the Participant s pension described in the preceding sentence, determined using the methods and assumptions prescribed by Section 4044 of ERISA, shall also be transferred to the Exelon
Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan. Such transfer of benefits and assets related thereto shall occur as soon as administratively practicable after the Eligible Employee makes the election described in paragraph (a) above. In the event that
an Eligible Employee whose pension and related assets are transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan receives a Notice and has a Separation from Service on or before December 31, 2002, the pension and related assets that
were transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan shall be transferred back to the Plan and the amount of the pension benefit accrued by such Employee during 2002 (if any) shall be determined under the terms of this Plan rather
than the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan. Such transfer shall occur as soon as administratively practicable.    2.9 Cessation
of Participation. An individual s participation in the Plan shall cease upon the first to occur of (i) the date the individual is no longer eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan or (ii) the individual s Separation from
Service if the individual has not completed at least five Vesting Years upon the date of his Separation from Service.  
      13  

2.10 Rehire of Employees. The following rules shall apply to an Eligible Employee who is rehired
by the Company after a Separation from Service and prior to commencing his pension or any benefits under the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan, as applicable:  
 (a) Rehire Date Before Absence of 5 Consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service. If an Employee terminates employment and is later
rehired by the Company before having an absence from employment with the Company and the Affiliates of five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, then either: (1) if such Employee was a Participant on the date his employment terminated, such
Employee shall be a Participant in the Plan as of his rehire date if he is then an Eligible Employee, or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall
not become a Participant. Notwithstanding clause (1) of the preceding sentence, if an Eligible Employee described in the preceding sentence was not at any time permitted to make the election described in Section 2.8(a) or was permitted to
make such election and elected to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan but such election was not given effect as a result of such Employee s Separation from Service, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect,
in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his rehire date or (2) participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan at the time prescribed therein and have his pension
and related assets transferred to such plan in the manner described in Section 2.8(b).    (b) Rehire Date After Absence
of at Least 5 Consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service. If an Employee terminates employment with the Company and the Affiliates and the Employee was not a Participant or was a Participant who did not have a vested pension as of the date his
employment terminated, and such Employee is rehired by the Company after having an absence from employment with the Company and the Affiliates of at least five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee
and shall not become a Participant upon such rehire. If a Participant with a vested pension terminates employment with the Company and the Affiliates and the Participant is rehired after having an absence from employment with the Company and the
Affiliates of at least five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, such Participant shall remain a Participant upon his rehire. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if a Participant described in the preceding sentence was not at any time
permitted to make the election described in Section 2.8(a), or was permitted to make such election and elected to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan but such election was not given effect as a result of such
Employee s Separation from Service, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his rehire date or (2) participate in the
Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan at the time prescribed therein and have his pension and related assets transferred to such plan in the manner described in Section 2.8(b).  
      14  

(c) Circumstances Permitting Commencement of Pension. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, if a Participant terminates employment and is reemployed as an Employee under circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s
policy regarding the rehiring or retirees, such Participant may elect to commence his pension during such period of reemployment if he is otherwise eligible to commence such pension.  
 (d) Rehire After Receipt of Benefit Under Section 5.11. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, an
Employee who is reemployed by an Employer after December 1, 2012 and has received a Special Lump Sum Payment or an Immediately Commencing Annuity in accordance with Section 5.11 shall not be eligible to become a Participant pursuant to
this Article 2.    2.11 Change in Employment Status or Transfer to Affiliate. Except as otherwise provided herein, if an Employee who was a
Participant transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in the Plan but are instead
either eligible to participate in another plan maintained by such Employer or Affiliate or are not eligible to participate in any plan, then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment participate in the plan, if any, determined
pursuant to rules established by the Company, which rules may be set forth in a Supplement hereto.    2.12 Certain Rehired Employees.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Employee who has received a Special Lump Sum Payment or an Immediately Commencing Annuity in accordance with Section 5.11 shall be eligible to become a Participant pursuant to this
Article 2.    2.13 Transfer of Employment to or from Facilities formerly Owned by CEG. Effective as of the Effective Time (as such term is
defined in the CEG Merger Agreement), if a Participant who was a Participant on or prior to the Effective Time transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated
employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in the Plan but are instead eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) that is intended to be a defined benefit pension
plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each such plan, a  CEG Pension Plan ) , then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment remain a Participant in the Plan and shall not participate in the CEG Pension Plan.
If a participant in the CEG Pension Plan who was a participant in such plan on or prior to the Effective Time transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated
employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in such plan but are instead eligible to participate in the Plan, then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment remain a participant in the CEG Pension Plan and
shall not participate in the Plan.  
      15  

ARTICLE III Accrual of Benefits.  
 3.1 Accrued Benefit. Except as otherwise provided in this Article or in Article VI, each Participant shall have an Accrued Benefit equal to
one-twelfth of the greater of:    (a) The sum of (1) 2% of his average annual Compensation during the period of his
service, if any, between January 1, 1930 and December 31, 1938, inclusive, multiplied by his Benefit Years before January 1, 1939, and (2) 2% of his aggregate Compensation for employment as an Eligible Employee after
December 31, 1938, or    (b) The sum of (1) a percentage of his average annual base salary plus, after
December 31, 2001, amounts earned (whether paid in the current or subsequent period) under the Exelon Corporation Annual Incentive Award Program for Management Employees, and the Exelon Corporation Quarterly Incentive Award Program (but
excluding amounts earned under any other business or group incentive or bonus programs) during his 60 consecutive months of employment with the Company that yield the highest twelve month average equal to 5% plus 1.2% for each of his first forty
Benefit Years, and (2) 0.35% of such highest average in excess of Covered Compensation as of the date of reference, multiplied by his Benefit Years (up to a maximum of 14%). (For the purposes of this Paragraph (b), (A) employment during
the most recent 5 years shall include absences which are included in Employment, except an absence prior to June 1, 1992 during which an Employee receives benefits under the Company s Disabilitant Plan, and the average annual base salary
of an Employee on an included absence shall be calculated as if his base salary continued during any period of such absence for which he did not receive compensation, such salary to be that in effect when such period began, adjusted for increases
applicable to his job classification which occur prior to the end of such period, (B) with respect to a Participant who is employed by the Company for less than 60-consecutive months, the Participant s average annual base salary shall be
determined by averaging the Participant s annual base salary for each calendar year in which the Participant was at any time an Employee, determined as if the Participant had remained an Employee for the entire year, provided, that, if there
are more than 5 such calendar years, the 5 years which result in the highest average will be used, (C) for purposes of determining consecutive months of employment, months in which the Participant performs no services, other than months for
which salary is imputed under (A) above, shall be disregarded, (D) annual base salary shall be determined prior to reduction by amounts contributed at the direction of the Employee to the PECO Energy Company Employee Savings Plan, the
Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan, the PECO Energy Company Employees  Section 125 Plan, the Exelon Corporation Benefits Contributions Options, the Exelon Corporation Flexible Benefits Program, or for Plan Years beginning after
December 31, 2001, amounts contributed to a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under Section 132(f)(4) of the Code, (E) effective January 1, 1990, a Participant s annual base salary shall not include any lump sum
payment of his accrued vacation pay or sick pay, nor any severance payment made by the Company or an Affiliate or pursuant to any plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate), (F) effective January 1, 1996 for purposes of calculating
average annual base salary, any raise received during the month shall be deemed to have been received on the first of such month and (G) amounts earned under the Exelon Corporation Annual Incentive Award Program for Management Employees and the
Exelon Corporation Quarterly Incentive Award Program shall be credited for the period such amounts are earned, regardless of when such amounts are actually paid).  
      16  

A Participant s Accrued Benefit, however, shall not be less than the largest early retirement benefit that
he could at any time elect to receive under the Plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the early retirement benefit that a Participant may elect to receive at any time of reference is the monthly annuity which, assuming he had a Separation
from Service on the date of reference, would be payable to him in the form of a Single Life Annuity beginning as of the later of the day ten years prior to his Normal Retirement Date or the first day of the month following the date of reference.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Accrued Benefit of a Power Team Employee shall be frozen as of the date the Employee becomes a Power Team Employee and
no Power Team Employee shall earn any additional Accrued Benefit under the Plan while the Employee is a Power Team Employee. The calculation of the benefit of a Power Team Employee under subsection (a) and (b) shall be made without regard
to any Compensation, annual base salary or earnings attributable to any period while the Employee is a Power Team Employee.    Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an EIS Senior Management Employee s Accrued Benefit shall be frozen as of October 31, 1999, or the date such Participant becomes an EIS Senior Management Employee, if later, and no EIS Senior Management Employee shall earn any
additional Accrued Benefit under the Plan after such date. The calculation of an EIS Senior Management Employee s benefit under subsection (a) and (b) shall be made without regard to any Compensation, annual base salary or earnings
attributable to any period after October 31, 1999, or the date such Participant becomes an EIS Senior Management Employee, if later.    Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1, the Accrued Benefit for a TXU Participant shall be equal to the greater of (1) such Participant s accrued benefit under the TXU Pension Plan immediately prior to the closing date of the
acquisition of TXU by the Company, and (2) such Participant s Accrued Benefit determined under subsection (b) above, calculated by including compensation earned by the Participant while he was employed by TXU to the extent such
compensation would have been included under subsection (b) if TXU had been part of the Company during the relevant time period and by including the years of service that were credited to the Participant under the TXU Pension Plan immediately
prior to the closing date of the acquisition of TXU by the Company.    3.2 Minimum Accrued Benefit. Except as provided in Section 6.5:
   (a) as a result of the imposition of the $200,000 cap on compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code effective
January 1, 1989 pursuant to Section 3.3, the Accrued Benefit of a Section 401(a)(17) Employee determined as of any date on or after January 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 1994 shall not be less than the sum of:  
 (1) his Accrued Benefit determined as of December 31, 1988 under the provisions of the Plan as in effect through
December 31, 1988; plus    (2) the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined under Section 3.1 based on the
Participant s Benefit Years earned on and after January 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1994;  
      17  

(b) as a result of the reduction of the $200,000 cap on compensation under
Section 401(a)(17) of the Code to $150,000 effective January 1, 1994 pursuant to Section 3.3, the Accrued Benefit of a Section 401(a)(17) Employee determined as of any date on or after January 1, 1994 shall not be less than
the sum of:    (3) his Accrued Benefit under Section 3.1 as of December 31, 1993 or, to the extent applicable, his
Accrued Benefit under Section 3.2(a) as of December 31, 1993, if greater, determined in each case under the provisions of the Plan as in effect through December 31, 1993; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision of the
Plan to the contrary, base salary for any determination period (as defined in Section 3.3) that is taken into account in determining an Employee s average annual base salary as of December 31, 1993 shall be subject to the
Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit (as defined in Section 3.3) in effect for 1993; plus    (4) the
Participant s Accrued Benefit determined under Section 3.1 based on the Participant s Benefit Years earned on and after January 1, 1994.  
 For purposes of Section 3.2(a), a  Section 401(a)(17) Employee  means an Eligible Employee who completes an Hour of Service on
or after January 1, 1989 and whose Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 1994 is based on annual Compensation or base salary for a determination period (as defined in Section 3.3)
beginning prior to January 1, 1989 that exceeds $200,000. For purposes of Section 3.2(b), a  Section 401(a)(17) Employee  means an Eligible Employee who completes an Hour of Service on or after January 1, 1994 and whose
Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1994 is based on annual Compensation or base salary for a determination period (as defined in Section 3.3) beginning prior to January 1, 1994 that exceeds $150,000.  
 3.3 Application of Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit. Annual Compensation taken into account for purposes of Section 3.1(a) (and
Articles IVA, IVB and IVC) and annual base salary taken into account for purposes of Section 3.1(b) (and Articles IVA, IVB and IVC) shall not exceed $200,000 ($150,000, effective January 1, 1994), or such other amount as may be applicable
under Code Section 401(a)(17) (the  Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit ). Except as provided below, the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over
which Compensation or base salary is determined ( determination period ) and which begins in such calendar year. Annual base salary for any determination period beginning prior to 1989 that is taken into account in determining an
Employee s average annual base salary for purposes of determining the Employee s Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1989 but prior to January 1, 1994 shall be subject to the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation
Limit in effect for 1989. Annual base salary for any determination period beginning prior to 1994 that is taken into account in determining an Employee s average annual base salary for purposes of determining the Employee s Accrued Benefit
as of a date on or after January 1, 1994 shall be subject to the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit in effect for 1994.  
      18  

If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the Section 401(a)(17)
Compensation Limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1997, the family aggregation rules
of Sections 401(a)(17)(A) of the Code, as in effect on December 31, 1996, shall apply.    3.4 Transferred Employees. The Accrued
Benefit of a Participant who has ceased to be an Eligible Employee but who is still an Employee shall be calculated on the basis of his Compensation, average annual base salary, Benefit Years, and the formula in effect under this Article III as of
the last date on which he is an Eligible Employee.    3.5 Rehired Employees. A Participant who is reemployed as an Employee and who
continues, or commences, his pension payments during the period of his reemployment shall, as required to continue pension payments in accordance with the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees, waive participation in, or
additional benefits and accruals under the Plan and accordingly, shall not be entitled to accrue any additional benefits under the Plan during his period of reemployment.  
 ARTICLE IV. Benefits.    4.1 Normal Retirement. If
an Active Participant has not already become vested pursuant to Section 4.4, he shall become fully vested in his Accrued Benefit when he attains Age 65, or, if later, upon the fifth anniversary of the date upon which he first became an Active
Participant and may retire on his Normal Retirement Date. Upon retiring, the Participant shall be entitled to a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month following the month in which his Normal Retirement Date occurs and is equal
to his Accrued Benefit.    4.2 Postponed Retirement.  
 (a) An employee may continue in service after his Normal Retirement Date. Except as provided in Section 4.11, an Active
Participant who continues in service after his Normal Retirement Date shall receive an annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following actual retirement, or as of his Required Beginning Date, if earlier. Such annuity shall be based
upon service, Compensation, average annual base salary and Covered Compensation measured as of the date he retires or his Required Beginning Date, whichever applies, and the benefit formula under Section 3.1 in effect as of such date. Effective
as of January 1, 2000, the annuity for an Employee whose Retirement Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which he incurs a Separation from Service shall include an Actuarial Equivalent adjustment to reflect
commencement of payments after April 1 following the calendar year in which he attained age 70  1   2 . The Actuarial Equivalent adjustment described in the
preceding sentence shall be made to Participant s Accrued Benefit as of each December 31 following his Required Beginning Date and preceding his Separation from Service, with the last such adjustment made as of his Separation from Service,
and for each such year or portion of a year, shall reduce (but not below zero) any increase in the Participant s Accrued Benefit for the year or portion of a year attributable to Benefit Years, Compensation, annual base salary, or changes in
Covered Compensation for that year or portion of a year.  
      19  

(b) Notwithstanding Paragraph (a), effective January 1, 1994, an executive
shall continue as an Employee after his Normal Retirement Date only with the consent of the Company or an Affiliate. For purposes of this Paragraph (b), an  executive  means a Participant who:  
 (1) Is (A) bona fide executive as defined in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations   541.1 and 1625.12 or
(B) employed in a high policy making position in the Company or an Affiliate within the meaning of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations  1625.12;  
 (2) Has attained Age 65;  
 (3) Has been in a position described in Paragraph (1) for the two-year period immediately prior to his retirement; and
   (4) Is entitled to an immediate vested annual retirement pension, commencing at Age 65 (or retirement, if later), from all
employee pension, profit sharing, savings and deferred compensation plans sponsored by the Company and all Affiliates which equals, in the aggregate, at least $44,000 (or such other amount as may be prescribed pursuant to Title 29 Code of Federal
Regulations  541.1 from time to time). In calculating the annual retirement pension, (A) all benefits shall be adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission so that the benefit is the
equivalent of a Single Life Annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions have been made and (B) there shall be excluded from the calculation of the retirement
pension amounts attributable to Social Security, employee contributions, contributions of prior employers, rollover contributions, and contributions described in Code  402(e)(3).  
 (a) If a Participant s Benefit Commencement Date precedes his actual retirement, the pension payable to the Participant
shall be determined as of the December 31 preceding his Benefit Commencement Date and adjusted as of January 1 in each calendar year following his Benefit Commencement Date, with the final adjustment to be made as of the date of his actual
retirement. Such annual adjustment shall include any increase (but not any decrease) in the Participant s Accrued Benefit, determined in accordance with Article III, as a result of additional Benefit Years and Compensation and changes to
average annual base salary, since the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or the last such annual adjustment, whichever applies.  
 4.3 Early Retirement.  
 (a) Effective August 1, 2000, an Active Participant who terminates after he has attained Age 50 and has to his credit at
least 10 Vesting Years may retire and shall upon so retiring be entitled to a monthly annuity that begins, at his election, as of the first day of the month following his retirement or as of the first day of any subsequent
 
      20  

month, but not after the first month following his Normal Retirement Date. Such election may be made no earlier than 90 days prior to the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Participant and
in no event earlier than the date on which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a). The amount of the annuity under this Subsection 4.3(a) shall be equal to the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined as of his
Benefit Commencement Date reduced as follows:      
   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (a), effective January 1, 2002, there shall be
no reduction to the Accrued Benefit of an Active Participant who is an hourly, nonexempt Eligible Employee and who has attained age 59 at the time of his Benefit Commencement Date.  
 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who has ceased to be an Active Participant
because he is an EIS Senior Management Employee, or because he has ceased to be an Employee of the Company and has thereupon become an Employee of EIS, shall continue to be treated as an Active Participant for purposes of this Section 4.3 and,
effective January 1, 2002, Section 5.3, but not for any other provision of the Plan, so long as (i) he continuously remains an Employee of EIS or a wholly owned subsidiary of EIS and (ii) EIS continuously remains an Affiliate.
   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who has ceased to be an Eligible
Employee and Active Participant because he is a Power Team Employee, shall continue to be treated as an Active Participant for purposes of this Section 4.3 and, effective December 31, 1996, Section 5.3, but not for any other provision
of the Plan, so long as he continuously remains a Power Team Employee.    4.4 Deferred Annuity. Effective as of August 1, 2000, any
Participant who has a Separation from Service prior to satisfying the requirements for retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3 but at a time when he has to his credit at least five Vesting Years shall upon his Separation from Service be entitled to
receive a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month  
      21  

following his Normal Retirement Date and is equal to his Accrued Benefit determined as of his Separation from Service. Alternatively, a Participant described in the preceding sentence may, at his
election, receive a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month following his fiftieth birthday or, at his option, on the first day of any month thereafter but not after the first month following his Normal Retirement Date that is
equal to the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined as of his Separation from Service. Any election of a Benefit Commencement Date prior to Normal Retirement Date made under this Section may be made no earlier than
90 days prior to the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Participant and in no event earlier than the date on which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a).  
 4.5 Disabled Eligible Employees. A Participant who has become disabled within the meaning of the Company s Disabilitant benefit plans
while an Eligible Employee shall continue to be credited with Benefit Years and Vesting Years during his period of Disabilitant to the extent set forth in Sections 1.7 (relating to Benefit Accrual Computation Period), 1.9 (relating to Benefit Year),
1.22 (relating to Employment) and 1.40 (relating to Vesting Service). If a disabled Participant has met the requirements to receive a pension under any Section of this Article IV (determined as if his Separation from Service had occurred on the date
of reference), such Participant may elect as his Benefit Commencement Date any date as may be provided under the applicable Section. If a disabled Participant continues to be credited with Benefit Years after his Benefit Commencement Date, the
amount of annuity payable to the Participant shall be determined as of his Benefit Commencement Date and shall be adjusted annually as of January 1 in each calendar year following his Benefit Commencement Date, up to and including the
January 1 next following the date the disabled Participant ceases to be credited with Benefit Years. Such annual adjustment shall include any increase (but not any decrease) in the Participant s Accrued Benefit, determined in accordance
with Article III, as a result of additional Benefit Years and Compensation and changes to average annual base salary, since the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or the last such annual adjustment, whichever applies. In addition, such
annual adjustment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the Actuarial Equivalent of any benefit paid to the Participant since his Benefit Commencement Date during any period (a) prior to Normal Retirement Date or (b) after Normal
Retirement Date that would have constituted  Section 202(a)(3)(B) Service  under Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations  2530.203-3(c)(1), to the extent not previously taken into account under this Section; provided, however, that the
amount, if any, of the benefits paid to the Participant which exceeds the amount the Participant would have received if distribution had been made in the normal form of benefits described in Section 5.1 or 5.2(a), whichever applies to the
Participant, shall be disregarded in determining the Actuarial Equivalent of such benefits for purposes of the reduction described in this sentence.  
 4.6 Maximum Annuity. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the amount of the Participant s annual benefit (as
defined below) accrued, distributed or payable at any time under the Plan shall be limited to an amount such that such annual benefit and the aggregate annual benefit of the Participant under all other defined benefit plans maintained by the
Employer or any other Affiliate does not exceed the lesser of:    (i) $160,000 (as increased to reflect the cost of living
adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the Code), multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of participation (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  
1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii)) and the denominator of which is 10; or.  
      22  

(ii) an amount equal to 100% of the Participant s average compensation for
the 3 consecutive calendar years in which his compensation was the highest (as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(a)(5)) and which are included in his years of service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  
1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii)) with the Employers multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of service with the Employers and the denominator of which is 10.  
 The dollar amount set forth in clause (i) of the preceding paragraph shall be actuarially reduced in accordance with Treas. Reg.  
1.415(b)-1(d) if pension benefits commence prior to the Participant s attainment of age 62. If a Participant s pension benefit payments commence after the Participant s attainment of age 65, such dollar amount shall be actuarially
increased in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(e).    A Participant s  annual benefit  shall mean the
Participant s accrued benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity, as determined in, and accordance with, Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(b). If the annual benefit is payable in a form other than a single life annuity, the
annual benefit shall be adjusted to the Actuarial Equivalent of a single life annuity using the assumptions of the following sentences;  provided ,  however , that no adjustment shall be required for survivor benefits payable to a
surviving Spouse under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (as described in Section 5.2) to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the Participant s annual benefit were paid in another form.  
 Effective for Plan Years beginning January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005, for any form of benefit subject to Section 417(e)(3) of
the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greater of (i) the amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table used to determine actuarial equivalence under the Plan and (ii) the amount computed using an interest
rate assumption of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table under Treas. Reg.   1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the  Applicable Mortality Table ). Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit subject
to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greatest of (i) the amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table used to determine actuarial equivalence under the Plan, (ii) the amount
computed using an interest rate assumption of 5.5% and the Applicable Mortality Table and (iii) the amount computed using the applicable interest rate under Treas. Reg.   1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the Applicable Mortality Table, divided by
1.05. Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be determined in accordance with Treas. Reg.  
1.415(b)-1(c). An individual s  annual benefit  under any other defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer and Affiliate shall be as determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder the terms of such plan.  
      23  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the limitation provided by this Section
shall not apply to a Participant who has not at any time participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by any Employer and whose annual benefit under the Plan does not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less
than 1/10th) the numerator of which is the Participant s years of service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii)) and the denominator of which is 10.  
 For purposes of this Section, the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in Section 415(c)(3) of the Code and the
applicable Regulations, the term  defined contribution plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.415(c)-1(a)(2), the term  defined benefit plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treas. Reg.  
1.415(b)-1(a)(2) and the term  Employer  shall include the Employers and all corporations and entities required to be aggregated with any of the Employers pursuant to Section 414(b) and (c) of the Code as modified by
Section 415(h) of the Code. Section 415 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder are hereby incorporated by reference.    4.7
Benefit Commencement Date. Unless the Participant elects otherwise, the pension to which he is entitled under this Article IV or Articles IVA or IVB shall begin within sixty days of the close of the Plan Year in which falls the later of his Normal
Retirement Date or his Separation from Service. The failure of the Participant to apply for his benefit pursuant to Section 5.9 by the date prescribed in the preceding sentence shall be deemed an election to defer payment to a later date.
Notwithstanding the above, payment of such pension shall begin no later than a Participant s Required Beginning Date, or the first day of the month following the date the Participant first becomes entitled to such pension, if later.  
 4.8 Post-Retirement Adjustment.  
 (a) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1978, benefit payments to Participants who retired under Sections 4.1,
4.2 or 4.3, or corresponding prior Sections, prior to January 1, 1978 and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 2% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 4%.  
 (b) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1980, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the foregoing
provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1980 and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 3% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 6%.  
 (c) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1982, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the foregoing
provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1982 and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 3% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 6%.  
 (d) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1984, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the foregoing
provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1984, and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 2% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 4%.  
      24  

(e) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1986, benefit payments to
Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1986, and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 2% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 4%.  
 (f) Commencing with installments due February 1, 1991, benefit payments to:  
 (1) Participants who retired under Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 of the Plan (or corresponding prior Sections) prior to
January 1, 1990;    (2) Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who died or retired under the
foregoing provisions prior to January 1, 1990;    (3) Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity beneficiaries of deceased
Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions prior to January 1, 1990; and    (4) surviving Spouses receiving
benefits under Section 5.4 due to the death of a Participant while an Active Participant prior to January 1, 1990, are increased by a factor of 3/4 of 1% multiplied by the difference obtained by subtracting the Participant s year of
retirement or death, as appropriate, from 1990. A Participant or beneficiary described in this Paragraph (f) may irrevocably elect to waive this increase in benefit payments by written notice to the Company made no later than 60 days after the
Participant or beneficiary is first notified of the increase by the Company.    (g) Commencing with installments due
February 1, 1997, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, and Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who died or retired under the
foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, are increased by fifty dollars ($50) per month.    (h)
Commencing with installments due January 1, 2000, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, and Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who
died or retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, are increased by fifty dollars ($50) per month.  
 4.9 Special Early Retirement Benefit. The annuity (and any Contingent Annuity Option benefit) of a Participant who retires under the early
retirement provisions of Section 4.3 between February 1, 1978 and June 1, 1978, inclusive, shall be computed without the 4% per year reduction described in the last sentence of Section 4.3. In addition, the monthly benefit
paid to such a Participant (but not the benefit to any Contingent Annuity Option beneficiary) shall be supplemented by a monthly payment equal to the Social Security old age insurance benefit to which the Participant would be entitled at Age 65
based on earnings received as an Employee of the Company, assuming he has no wages for Social Security purposes after his retirement and there is no change in the Social Security law or rates subsequent to his retirement. The supplemental benefit
described in the preceding sentence shall end with the payment on the first day of the month preceding the month in which the Participant first receives (or could have  
      25  

received if he had applied) Social Security old age insurance benefits unreduced on account of age, or with the payment last preceding the Participant s death, if earlier. The special
benefits described in this Section shall also be paid with respect to a Participant who elects early retirement during the period February 1, 1978 through June 1, 1978, inclusive, but whose actual retirement is postponed at the request of
the Company in order to provide for personnel replacement and training.    4.10 Minimum Annuity. The annuity of a Participant who retires or
has retired under Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, or corresponding prior Sections regardless of the form of his benefit under Article V, and who is not at any time a Highly Compensated Employee, shall not be less than $150 per month.  
 4.11 Suspension of Benefits. With respect to any Participant whose employment by the Company or an Affiliate continues past his Normal
Retirement Date, or who is receiving benefits under the Plan and again becomes an Employee, the following rules shall apply:  
 (a) If the reemployed Participant has not reached his Normal Retirement Date, his pension shall be suspended and recomputed
under the Plan upon his subsequent Separation from Service.    (b) If the Participant has reached his Normal Retirement Date,
for each calendar month or for each four or five week payroll period ending in a calendar month during which the Participant either completes forty or more Hours of Service (counting each day of Employment as five Hours of Service), or receives
payment for any such Hours of Service performed on each of eight or more days or separate work shifts in such month or payroll period, (referred to herein as  Suspension Service ) no pension payment shall be made, and no adjustment to the
Participant s pension shall be made on account of such non-payment. No payment shall be withheld pursuant to this Paragraph (b) until the Employee is notified by personal delivery or first class mail during the first calendar month or
payroll period in which payments are suspended that his benefits are suspended. Such notification shall contain a description of the specific reasons why benefit payments are being suspended, a general description of the Plan provisions relating to
the suspension of payments and a copy of such provisions (or a reference to the relevant pages of the summary plan description providing such information), and a statement to the effect that applicable Department of Labor Regulations may be found in
Section 2530.203-3 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In addition, the suspension notification shall inform the Employee of the Plan s procedure for affording a review of the suspension of benefits.  
 (c) The pension of a reemployed Participant whose benefits were suspended under this Section 4.11 shall begin again no
later than the earlier of (1) the first day of the third month following the month in which the Participant first fails to satisfy the service requirements described in Paragraph (b) or has a Separation from Service or (2) his
Required Beginning Date. The resumed pension shall be recalculated to reflect Compensation, average annual base salary and Benefit Years earned under the Plan as in effect during such period of reemployment and shall be reduced by the
 
      26  

Actuarial Equivalent of any payment received by the Employee under the Plan prior to his Normal Retirement Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Participant s monthly pension
payable in the form of a single life annuity when reemployment ends be less than the monthly pension that was payable to the Participant in the form of a single life annuity prior to his period of reemployment. The full amount of the resumed pension
shall be paid in the form determined pursuant to Article V at the time payments are resumed, without regard to the form of payment in effect for the Participant prior to his reemployment. The pension of any Participant whose employment continued
past his Normal Retirement Date (and whose benefits are not suspended because of employment as described in Paragraph (b)) shall be paid pursuant to Section 4.2.  
 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, a Participant who received a pension while the
Participant worked for Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation) before the assets of Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation) were acquired by EIS or its
Affiliate, shall not have his pension suspended under this Section 4.11 solely as a result of the acquisition of the assets of Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation) by EIS or its Affiliate, so
long as the Participant remains continuously employed thereafter by the Company or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, this Section 4.11 shall not apply to a Participant who is reemployed by an
Affiliated Company that does not maintain a defined benefit pension plan.    (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.11, a reemployed Participant who is employed under circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees
shall not have his pension suspended under this Section 4.11 nor shall such reemployed Participant be prohibited from commencing his pension if he is otherwise eligible to commence such pension.  
 4.12. Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit
restrictions shall apply if the Plan s  Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage  (the  AFTAP ), as defined in Section 436(j) of the Code, is at or below the following levels.  
 (i) If the Plan s AFTAP is 60% or greater but less than 80% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment
(as defined in Section 4.12(a)(iv)) after the valuation date for the Plan Year to the extent the amount of the payment exceeds the lesser of (x) 50% of the amount of the payment which could be made without regard to the restrictions under
this subsection 4.13 and (y) the present value (determined pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under Section 417(e) of the Code) of the maximum guarantee
with respect to the Participant under Section 4022 of ERISA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, only one such prohibited payment may be made with respect to any Participant during any period of consecutive Plan Years to which the
limitations under either clause (x) or (y) of the preceding sentence apply. For purposes of this Section 4.12(a)(i), a Participant, his beneficiary and any alternate payee (as defined in Section 414(p)(8) of the Code) shall be
deemed a single  Participant.   
      27  

(ii) If the Plan s AFTAP is less than 60% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall
not pay any prohibited payment after the valuation date for the Plan Year.    (iii) During any period in which the Company is
a debtor in a case under Title 11, United States Code (or similar federal or state law), the Plan shall not make any prohibited payment. The preceding sentence shall not apply on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies
that the AFTAP is not less than 100%.    (iv) For purposes of this Section 4.12(a), the term  prohibited
payment  means (x) any payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any social security supplements described in the last sentence of Section 411(a)(9) of the Code) to a Participant or beneficiary
whose annuity starting date (as defined in Section 417(f)(2) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) occurs during any period a limitation under Section 4.12(a)(ii) or (iii) is in effect, (y) any payment for the
purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or (z) any other payment specified by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.  
 (b) In any Plan Year in which the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60%, benefit accruals under the Plan shall
cease as of the valuation date for the Plan Year. This restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company of a contribution (in addition to any minimum required
contribution under Section 430 of the Code) equal to the amount sufficient to result in an AFTAP of 60%.    (c) No
amendment which has the effect of increasing Plan liabilities by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accruals or the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect during any
Plan Year if the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 80% or would be less than 80% after taking into account such amendment; provided, however, that the preceding restriction shall not apply to an amendment which provides for an
increase in benefits under a formula which is not based on a Participant s compensation if the rate of such increase is not in excess of the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of Participants covered by the amendment; and
provided, further, that such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment), upon payment by the Company of a contribution as
described in Section 436(c)(2) of the Code.  
      28  

(d) The Plan shall not provide an unpredictable contingent event benefit payable
with respect to any event occurring during any Plan Year if the AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60% or would be less than 60% after taking into account such occurrence; provided, however, such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to
any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company of a contribution as described in Section 436(b)(2) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 4.12(d), the term  unpredictable contingent event
benefit  means any benefit payable solely by reason of a plant shutdown (or similar event, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), or any event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of
any compensation, or occurrence of death or disability.    (e) To avoid benefit restrictions, the Company may take any action
permitted by Section 436 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.    (f) The provisions of this
Section 4.12 are intended to comply with Section 436 of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall be construed to comply therewith.  
 4.13. Participant s Death During Qualified Military Service. Effective January 1, 2007, in the case of a Participant who dies while
performing Qualified Military Service, the Beneficiaries of such Participant shall be entitled to any additional benefits, if any (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of Qualified Military Service), provided under the Plan had the
Participant resumed employment with an Employer and then terminated such employment on account of such Participant s death.    ARTICLE IVA. Special
Limited Duration Early Retirement Benefit.    4A.1 Eligibility.  
 (a) The special limited duration early retirement benefit described in Section 4A.3 shall be available to any Active
Participant who:    (1) as of December 31, 1990, has attained Age 50 and has to his credit at least five Benefit Years;
and    (2) makes a Special Early Retirement Election in accordance with the provisions of Section 4A.2 and does not
withdraw such Election on or before September 15, 1990 as provided in Section 4A.2(b).    (b) The Accrued Benefit
of an Active Participant who satisfies the requirements of Paragraph (a)(1) above and who dies after July 14, 1990, but before September 16, 1990, shall be calculated under Section 4A.3 as of the date of his death for purposes of
determining any death benefit payable on behalf of the Participant pursuant to Section 5.3 or 5.4, notwithstanding his failure to satisfy the requirement of Paragraph (a)(2) above.  
      29  

4A.2 Special Early Retirement Election.  
 (a) for the purposes of this Article, a  Special Early Retirement Election  is a written election that:  
 (1) is submitted to the Plan Administrator on or after July 15, 1990 and on or before September 15, 1990; and  
 (2) that indicates the Active Participant s intent to retire from employment with the Company:  
 (A) if the Active Participant elects to participate in the Company s Service Completion Plan, on his  Service
Completion Date  (as defined in Section 4A.4(c)(2) below); or    (B) if the Active Participant does not elect to
participate in the Company s Service Completion Plan, on August 1, 1990, September 1, 1990, or October 1, 1990;  
 provided, however, that the election described in Section 4A.2(a)(2)(A) shall not be available to an Active Participant described in
Section 4A.4(c)(1)(B).    (b) An Active Participant s Special Early Retirement Election shall become irrevocable as
of September 15, 1990 if it has not been withdrawn by the Active Participant on or before such date.    4A.3 Benefits. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, each Active Participant who satisfies the requirements of Section 4A.1 shall be entitled to retire on the following terms:  
 (a) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1, each Active Participant who satisfies the requirements of
Section 4A.1 shall have an Accrued Benefit equal to one-twelfth of the greater of:    (A) the sum of (i) 2% of his
average annual Compensation during the period of his service, if any, between January 1, 1930 and December 31, 1938, inclusive, multiplied by his Benefit Years before January 1, 1939, and (ii) 2% of his aggregate Compensation for
employment after December 31, 1938, or    (B) the sum of (i) a percentage of his average annual base salary during
his 60 consecutive months of employment with the Company that yield the highest twelve month average equal to 5%, plus 1.2% multiplied by the sum of five plus his number of Benefit Years determined as of his Separation from Service (to a maximum of
45), and (ii) 0.35% of such highest average annual base salary in excess of Covered Compensation as of the date of reference, multiplied by his Benefit Years (up to a maximum of 14%);  
      30  

(2) Notwithstanding the above, the Accrued Benefit of an Active Participant who
satisfies the requirements of Section 4A.1 shall not exceed the maximum amount permissible under Sections 401(l) and 415 of the Code when such limitations are applied as follows:  
 (A) The limitations of Sections 401(l) and 415 shall be applied in the following order of priority: (I) prior to
August 3, 1992, the ten-year phase-in limitation applicable to changes in the benefit structure under Section 415(b)(1)(5)(D) of the Code; (II) the limitations on the maximum excess allowance applicable when unreduced benefits are payable
prior to social security retirement age as described under Section 401(l)(5)(F)(i) of the Code; and (III) the limitation described in Section 415(b)(1) of the Code;  
 (B) The ten-year phase-in limitation described in Subsection (A)(I) above shall apply to changes in benefits resulting from
the crediting of five additional Benefit Years under Section 4A.3(a)(1)(B)(I); provided, however, that such limitation shall cease to apply on and after August 3, 1992;  
 (C) The limitations on the maximum excess allowance described in Subsection (A)(II) above shall apply only to such
Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees at any time after 1989 and prior to Separation from Service; and    (D)
For purposes of the limitations described in Subsections (A)(I) and (A)(III) above, the following actuarial assumptions shall be used to determine adjusted limitations for Participants whose benefit payments commence prior to Age 55: (I) 5%
interest; and (II) the 1971 Forecast Mortality Table with a one-year age rating.    (3) For the purposes of

ARTICLE V. Form of Pensions.  
 5.1 Unmarried Participants. The monthly annuity of a Participant who is unmarried on his Benefit Commencement Date shall be paid as a Single
Life Annuity unless he elects an optional form of benefit under Section 5.3 or receives a lump sum distribution under Section 5.6.  
 5.2 Married Participants.  
 (a) The monthly annuity of a Participant who is married on his Benefit Commencement Date, shall be paid as a Qualified Joint
and Survivor Annuity, unless he elects an optional form of benefit under Paragraph (b) or Section 5.3 or receives a lump sum distribution under Section 5.6.  
 (b) A Participant described in Paragraph (a) may elect to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and receive his
annuity in the form of a Single Life Annuity. Any such election shall be subject to the spousal consent requirements described in Section 5.7, shall be made in writing in a manner prescribed by the Company and may be made or revoked at any time
within the 90 day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Participant but in no event earlier than the date on which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a).  
 5.3 Contingent Annuity Option.  
 (a) An Active Participant (including a Participant who is treated as an Active Participant for purposes of Section 4.3 and
this Section 5.3, but not for any other provision of the Plan) who has at least 14 Benefit Years, or who has attained Age 65 and has at least 5 Benefit Years, or a Participant (including a Participant who continues to be treated as an Active
Participant for purposes of Section 4.3 and Section 5.3, but not for any other provision of the Plan) who had a Separation from Service after becoming eligible for early retirement under Section 4.3 (hereinafter referred to as an
 Eligible Participant ), may elect, in writing on a form prescribed by the Administrator, a Contingent Annuity Option under which he may designate a percentage of his annuity to be paid upon his death to a contingent beneficiary designated
by him. The percentage so designated shall be 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%, as the Participant elects, and may be changed by an Eligible Participant at any time prior to the later of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or Separation from Service.
The annuity otherwise payable to a Participant electing a Contingent Annuity Option or to his contingent beneficiary will be actuarially reduced using the factors described in Appendix A to reflect the payments which may become payable to the
beneficiary. Notwithstanding the above, if the Eligible Participant s Spouse is designated as contingent beneficiary, the actuarial reduction will not reflect the cost of a joint and survivor annuity option providing a survivor annuity to the
Participant s Spouse of (1) 50% of the amount payable to the Participant, if a 50%, 75% or 100% contingent annuity option is elected, or (2) 25% of the amount payable to  
      52  

the Participant, if a 25% contingent annuity option is elected; provided, however, that the subsidy described in this sentence shall not apply to a former spouse who is to be treated as a
Participant s spouse pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, unless the qualified domestic relations order specifically provides that such subsidy applies to the former spouse. If the contingent beneficiary is other than the Spouse,
the percentage payable to the contingent beneficiary after the Participant s death may not exceed the applicable percentage from Appendix B. The Contingent Annuity Option of an electing Participant who has a Separation from Service and is not
eligible for early retirement under Section 4.3 shall be canceled.    (b) (1) An Eligible Participant s election or
change in election under Paragraph (a) shall become effective on the first of the month next following the date such election or change is properly filed with the Administrator.  
 (2) An Eligible Participant s election under Paragraph (a) shall not be valid upon a Participant s Benefit
Commencement Date if such election is not confirmed in writing by such Participant, with spousal consent as described in Section 5.7, within the 90 day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date, and in no event earlier than the date on
which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a). If an Eligible Participant has made no election under Paragraph (a), or has made an invalid election, as of his Benefit Commencement Date, such Participant s pension
shall be paid as described in Section 5.1 or 5.2, whichever applies.    (3) (A) The election under Paragraph (a) in
effect for an Eligible Participant who is married on the date of his death shall not be valid upon the Participant s death unless (i) the spousal consent requirements of Section 5.7 are satisfied; (ii) if the Participant s
death occurs after the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains Age 35, the Participant s election was made or confirmed in writing (with the applicable spousal consent) on or after the first day of such Plan Year, and
(iii) in the event that the election in effect under Paragraph (a) does not provide for a survivor benefit to the Participant s surviving Spouse, the Participant has made no change to his election under Paragraph (a) that has not
yet taken effect which would result in a survivor benefit payable to his Spouse. If an Eligible Participant who is married at the time of his death has made no election, or has made an invalid election, the Participant s surviving Spouse shall
receive the benefit described in Section 5.4. With respect to an Eligible Participant described in the preceding sentence, no additional benefit shall be payable to any other contingent beneficiary or to the Participant s estate.  
 (B) If an Eligible Participant (1) is unmarried at the time of his death, (2) is survived by one or more children,
(3) has not begun receiving any benefits hereunder, and (4) either has failed to make a valid election under Paragraph (A) or is not survived by a designated contingent beneficiary, a benefit equal to the amount that would be payable
assuming that the Participant made a valid election under Paragraph (a) and designated a percentage of 100% shall be paid to the Participant s surviving children, if any, in equal shares. For all purposes of the Plan, where applicable, the
person to whom benefits are payable pursuant to this Paragraph (b) shall be treated as the Participant s contingent beneficiary.  
      53  

(c) Except as provided in Paragraph (b):  
 (1) If an electing Participant who has had a Separation from Service whose Contingent Annuity Option has not been canceled dies
on or after the effective date of the option, his contingent beneficiary, if surviving, will receive an annuity for life beginning as of the first day of the second month following his death and based upon the designated percentage of the annuity
which the Participant was receiving or to which he would have been entitled; provided, however, that, if the contingent beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse and the designated percentage is at least 50%, payment to the Spouse shall
not begin prior to what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date without the Spouse s written consent made within the 90-day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date.  
 (2) If an electing Active Participant dies on or after the effective date of the option, his contingent beneficiary, if living,
shall receive an annuity, for life, beginning as of the first day of the second month following the month in which the Participant s death occurs, based upon the designated percentage of the benefit to which the Participant would have been
immediately entitled if he had retired on the date of his death; provided, however, that, if the contingent beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse, the designated percentage shall be deemed to be 100%, and payment to such Spouse
shall not begin prior to what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date without the Spouse s written consent made within the 90-day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date. For purposes of this Subparagraph only, the
annuity to which a Participant would have been entitled shall be his Accrued Benefit reduced in accordance with Section 4.3 and, if applicable, reduced further by 4% per year (to the nearest one-twelfth year) for any period by which his
age at the time of his death is less than 50.    (d) (1) If the contingent beneficiary dies after the effective date of the
option and after the later of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or his Separation from Service, the reduced annuity payable to the Participant will remain in effect.  
 (2) If the contingent beneficiary dies after the effective date of the option, but prior to the later of the Participant s
Normal Retirement Date or his Separation from Service, the option shall be canceled upon receipt of proof of death. If the Participant has not then reached his Normal Retirement Date or has not had a Separation from Service, the Participant may
elect a subsequent Contingent Annuity Option effective immediately upon notice to the Company, subject to the conditions stated herein. If he has reached his Normal Retirement Date and has had a Separation from Service, the Participant may not make
any further elections.  
      54  

(e) Subject to the conditions of Paragraph (a), an Eligible Participant may make
or change his election and designate or change a beneficiary and/or designate a revised benefit percentage at any time prior to the later of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or Separation from Service. An Eligible Participant may,
regardless of whether he has previously made a different election under this Section 5.3, elect in writing to receive his annuity in the form provided in Section 5.1 or 5.2, whichever applies, or in such other form as is permitted under
Paragraph (a), subject to the provisions of Section 5.7. The Participant may make such an election at any time before the Benefit Commencement Date but such an election may not be revoked after the Benefit Commencement Date, except as provided
in Paragraph (d)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective July 15, 1990, a Participant who has not reached his Normal Retirement Date and who elects a form of benefit under this Section 5.3 may waive any right to change his election in
the future and irrevocably elect a specific Contingent Annuity Option as of his Benefit Commencement Date.    (f) Commencing
with payments due September 1, 1986, the minimum monthly annuity to which a designated beneficiary under a Contingent Annuity Option described in this Section 5.3 shall be entitled is $150.  
 5.4 Death Benefits for Other Vested Participants.  
 (a) Eligibility. A death benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.4 with respect to a Participant who dies prior to
his Benefit Commencement Date if on the date of his death he is married and:    (1) he does not meet the requirements for the
Contingent Annuity Option described in Section 5.3, and    (A) he is an Employee who has met the requirements for early

      55

Spouse s death occurs, and shall be in a monthly amount equal to the amount the Spouse would have received if the Participant s Separation from Service had occurred on the day of his death and he had survived and elected to begin receiving

applies, and elect an optional form of payment and the financial effect of such an election on his pension, (3) the rights of the Participant s Spouse, if any, with respect to the waiver and election, (4) the Participant s right
to revoke an election to receive an optional form of payment and the effect of such revocation, (5) if the Participant has not reached his Normal Retirement Date, the Participant s right to defer commencement of his pension until his
Normal Retirement Date and the financial effect of such deferment, and (6) a description of the relative value of the optional forms of benefit as compared to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. Such information shall be furnished to the
Participant not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, and the time for an election under this Section shall begin no earlier than the date such information is furnished.  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, the Participant s
Benefit Commencement Date may be fewer than 30 days after the explanation described in this Section is provided if:    (1)
the Participant is given notice of his right to a 30-day period in which to consider whether to (i) waive the normal form of benefit and elect an optional form and (ii) to the extent applicable, consent to the distribution;  
 (2) the Participant affirmatively elects a distribution and a form of benefit and the Spouse, if necessary, consents to the
form of the benefit elected;    (3) the Participant is permitted to revoke his affirmative election at any time prior to his
Benefit Commencement Date, or if later, the expiration of a 7-day period beginning on the day after the explanation described in this Section is provided to the Participant;  
      57  

(4) the Benefit Commencement Date is after the date the Administrator receives
written notice of the Participant s intent to begin receiving benefits; and    (5) distribution to the Participant does
not commence before the expiration of the 7-day period described in paragraph (3) above.    Notwithstanding the
foregoing, effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2004, the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date may precede the explanation described in this Section, if the Participant so elects, provided that the following
conditions are satisfied:    (5) the date the on which the first payment to be received by the Participant is made (the
 initial payment date ) shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early as the seventh day after such notice is
provided if (i) such notice clearly indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided under the Plan and to elect (with
spousal consent) an optional form of benefit, (ii) the Participant affirmatively elects a form of distribution with the consent of his Spouse (if required) to commence as of the initial payment date, and (iii) the Participant is permitted
to revoke such election until the initial payment date;    (6) the notice shall be provided to the Participant no more than
ninety (90) days before the initial payment date, however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)- day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;  
 (7) the Participant is not permitted to elect an Benefit Commencement Date that precedes the date upon which the Participant
could have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in effect on the Benefit Commencement Date;  
 (8) to the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for the period from the Benefit Commencement Date to the
initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the period beginning on the Benefit Commencement
Date and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in the preceding
sentence shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Annuity Starting Date on or after January 1, 2008, the interest rate used to compute the adjustment
described in the sentence above shall be the interest rate as specified or prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, in revenue rulings, notices or other guidance for November
of the preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 4.6 of the Plan, the limitations set forth  
      58  

therein shall comply with the adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with respect to any Benefit Commencement Date described in this paragraph which is a
 retroactive annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and    (9) if a Participant who is
married elects to commence the Participant s benefit as of the initial payment date pursuant to this paragraph, then the Participant s Spouse (including an alternate payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified
domestic relations order), determined as of the initial payment date, must consent to such election if the survivor benefits payable as of the Benefit Commencement Date are less than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in
Section 5.2(a) of the Plan as of the initial payment date.    (b) Each Eligible Participant described in
Section 5.3(a) shall receive a written explanation of (1) the terms and conditions of the pre-retirement survivor annuity described in Section 5.4, (2) the Participant s right to waive such survivor annuity in favor of the
death benefit under a Contingent Annuity Option and the effect of such waiver, (3) the rights of the Participant s Spouse with respect to such waiver, and (4) the Participant s right to revoke such waiver and the effect of such
revocation. Such explanation shall be provided when the Participant first becomes an Eligible Participant described in Section 5.3(a) and, if the Eligible Participant has not attained Age 32 at the time of the first notice, again within the
three-year period that begins on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains Age 32.    5.6 Cash-Outs. Effective on such
date as shall be determined by the Company, if the Actuarial Equivalent single-sum value, determined as of the date of distribution, of the vested Accrued Benefit of a Participant who has had a Separation from Service, or of the benefit payable to a
Spouse or other beneficiary under Section 5.3 or 5.4 by reason of the Participant s death prior to his Benefit Commencement Date, is $5,000 or less, or, for distributions occurring on or after March 28, 2005, $1,000 or less, the
benefit shall be paid, as soon as administratively practicable following the later of (a) the Participant s Separation from Service or death, or (b) the effective date of this Section 5.6, as a single-sum in settlement of all
liabilities of the Plan in connection with the Participant; provided, however, that no such payment shall be made after such benefit has commenced in any other form.  
 5.7 Spousal Consent. No Participant s election:  
 (a) to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in favor of a form of payment other than a Contingent Annuity Option
providing for payment of at least 50% of the Participant s annuity to his surviving Spouse, or    (b) to waive the death
benefit described in Section 5.4 in favor of the death benefit payable under a form of payment other than a Contingent Annuity Option described in Paragraph (a), above,  
      59  

shall be effective with respect to a Participant who is married unless the Participant s Spouse (as of the
Benefit Commencement Date or date of death, whichever applies) consents thereto in writing, and such consent (1) acknowledges the effect of the election, (2) specifies the designated beneficiary or consents to such designation and consents
prospectively to any subsequent designation of beneficiary made by the Participant, acknowledging the Spouse s right to limit consent to a specific alternate beneficiary, (3) specifies the optional form of payment or consents to such
election and consents prospectively to any subsequent choice of optional form made by the Participant, acknowledging the Spouse s right to limit consent to a specific optional form, and (4) is witnessed by a Plan representative or by a
notary public, or the Administrator finds that the Spouse cannot be located.    5.8 Minimum Distribution Requirements. Notwithstanding
anything in the Plan to the contrary, the form and timing of all distributions under the Plan to any Participant, including a Participant whose Separation from Service occurred prior to January 1, 1989, shall be in accordance with
Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, including the incidental death benefit requirements of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Code and Treas. Reg.  1.401(a)(9)-2.  
 5.9 Application for Benefits. Except as provided in Section 5.6 or in Section 5.3(c) for a non-Spouse contingent beneficiary,
benefit payments shall commence when properly written application for same is received by the Administrator. In the event that a Participant, or the Spouse of a deceased Participant entitled to benefits under the Plan fails to apply to the
Administrator by the earlier of (a) the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or the date of the Participant s Separation from service, if later, or (b) the end of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2, the
Administrator shall make diligent efforts to locate such Participant or Spouse and obtain such application. In the event the Participant or Spouse fails to make application by the Participant s Required Beginning Date, subject to
Section 10.6, the Administrator shall commence distribution as of the Required Beginning Date without such application. No payments shall be made for the period in which benefits would have been payable if the Participant or Spouse had made
timely application therefor; provided, however, that, if the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or, if the Participant has died, his Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, has been delayed until after the Participant s Normal
Retirement Date solely by reason of failure to make application, and not by reason of Suspension Service as described in Section 4.11(b), the benefit payable (i) to the Participant on and after his Benefit Commencement Date, or
(ii) to the Participant s Spouse on and after the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, shall be equal to the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit the Participant or the Spouse would have received had benefits commenced on the
Participant s Normal Retirement Date, as determined to reflect the deferral of benefit commencement.    5.10 Direct Rollovers. In the
event any payment or payments under the Plan to be made to a  eligible distributee  would constitute an  eligible rollover distribution,  such eligible distributee may request that, in lieu of payment to the eligible distributee,
all or part of such payment or payments be rolled over directly from the Trustee to the trustee of an  eligible retirement plan.  Any such request shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator or its delegate,
subject to such requirements and restrictions as may be prescribed by applicable Treasury regulations. For purposes of this Section 5.10:  
 (a)  eligible distributee  shall include the Participant, his Spouse or his alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code or, effective January 1, 2008, the Participant s beneficiary who is not the Participant s Spouse;  
      60  

(b)  eligible rollover distribution  shall mean a distribution from the
Plan, excluding (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) over the life (or life expectancy) of the eligible distributee, the joint lives (or joint life
expectancies) of the eligible distributee and eligible distributee s designated beneficiary, or a specified period of ten (10) or more years, and (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under
Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and    (c)  eligible retirement plan  shall mean (i) an individual
retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) a qualified
plan the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover distributions, (v) an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(i)(A)
of the Code that shall separately account for the distribution, (vi) an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or (vii) an individual retirement plan described in Section 408A(b) of the Code; provided, however,
that (x) with respect to a plan described in clause (vii), for transfers occurring before January 1, 2010, the eligible distributee meets the requirements of Section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (y) with respect to a
distribution (or portion of a distribution) to a person who is not the Participant or the surviving Spouse of the Participant,  eligible retirement plan  shall mean only a plan described in clause (i) or (ii) or, effective
January 1, 2010, clause (vii), that, in either case, is established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person.  
 5.11. Special Lump Sum Payment Option. (a) Eligibility. A Participant (but not his or her Beneficiary) may elect to receive, during the
election period described in Paragraph (b), his or her deferred Accrued Benefit ( Deferred Annuity ) under Section 4.4 of the Plan in the form of a lump sum payment ( Special Lump Sum Payment ) or, an  Immediately
Commencing Annuity  (as defined below); provided, however, that:    (i) the Participant has a termination of employment
on or prior to June 30, 2012 and does not die and is not rehired during the period beginning July 1, 2012 and ending on the date payment is made or commences in accordance with this Section 5.11;  
 (ii) such termination of employment is not on account of the Participant s disability, following which the Participant is
receiving long-term disability payments under any long-term disability program of an Employer, including on June 30, 2012;  
 (iii) the Participant s Deferred Annuity is not subject to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in
Section 414(p) of the Code;  
      61  

(iv) the Participant is not immediately, as of his or her termination of
employment, eligible for early retirement benefits in accordance with this Article IV;    (v) the Participant is not on a
leave of absence or layoff from an Employer on June 30, 2012;    (vi) the Participant is not 70  1   2  years of age or older as of October 1, 2012; and  
 (vii) the Participant can be located, after a diligent search, as necessary, by the Plan Administrator before July 1,
2012.    For each such Participant described in this Paragraph (a), the term  Immediately Commencing Annuity  shall
mean, as applicable, either:    (i) with respect to a Participant eligible to commence receipt of his or her Deferred Annuity
as of December 1, 2012, in accordance with the requirements of Section 4.4, any applicable optional form of annuity described in Article V; or  
 (ii) with respect to any other Participant, a single life annuity, 50%  qualified joint and survivor annuity  (within
the meaning Section 417(b) of the Code) or a 75%  qualified optional survivor annuity  (within the meaning Section 417(g) of the Code).  
 (b) Election and Election Period. To receive the distribution of benefits described in Paragraph (a), an eligible Participant
must voluntarily elect to receive a distribution pursuant to this Section 5.11 by completing an election form and spousal waiver, if required, provided by the Administrator, and submitting such forms to the Administrator after October 1,
2012 and before the following dates, as applicable,    (i) November 15, 2012, with respect to a Participant who elects a
Special Lump Sum Payment; and    (iii) December 15, 2012, with respect to a Participant who elects an Immediately
Commencing Annuity,    or such other period during 2012 determined by the Administrator.  
 The Administrator shall provide each eligible Participant, not less than 30 days and not more than 180 days before the Benefit
Commencement Date, an application form including a general description of the material features, as well as an explanation of the relative values and financial effect, of the optional forms of benefit available under this Section 5.11, in a
manner that satisfies the notice requirements of Section 417(a)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The form shall indicate the Participant s right to waive a survivor annuity, his or her surviving Spouse s right to consent
to such waiver or refuse such consent, and the right to revoke any waiver, within the 180 day period  
      62  

preceding the Benefit Commencement Date, and shall include a description of the right of the Participant, if any, to defer receipt of a distribution and the consequences of failure to defer such
receipt, in accordance with Treasury guidance under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code.    (c) Amount of Payment. The
Special Lump Sum Payment shall equal the actuarial equivalent of the Participant s nonforfeitable Deferred Annuity, based on the following factors:  
 (i) the applicable interest rate described in Section 417(e)(3) of the Code for August of 2011;  
 (ii) an assumed commencement date of the later of (A) age 65, and (B) the Participant s age as of
December 1, 2012; and    (iii) the applicable mortality table, as defined in Section 417 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.    The Immediately Commencing Annuity shall be calculated:  
 (i) in accordance with the applicable terms of the Plan, for a Participant who is eligible to immediately commence benefits
under the terms of the Plan as of the payment date set forth in Paragraph (d); and    (ii) as the actuarial equivalent of the
Special Lump Sum Payment, for each other Participant.    (d) Payment of Benefit. If an eligible Participant elects the
distribution of his or her Deferred Annuity in accordance with this Section 5.11, payment shall be made, or commence to be made, on or before December 1, 2012, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  
 (e) Death and Rehire. If an eligible Participant elects the distribution of his or her Deferred Annuity in accordance with this
Section 5.11 and subsequently dies or is rehired as an Employee before distributions commence, his or her election shall be null and void and the Participant s benefit shall be paid pursuant to the Plan without regard to this
Section 5.11. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, upon distribution of a Special Lump Sum Payment or an Immediately Commencing Annuity made to an individual in accordance with this Section 5.11, in the event of the
individual s rehire with an Employer following the date such distribution is made, the individual shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan during such period of rehire and may be eligible to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash
Balance Pension Plan or the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees (or such other plan that applies to employees of an Employer hired on or after December 1, 2012), as applicable, in accordance with their terms and
conditions.  
      63  

ARTICLE VI. Breaks in Service.  
 6.1 Whenever used in this Article:  
 (a)  One-Year Break in Service  means a calendar year in which an Employee completes 500 or fewer Hours of Service.
   (b)  Reemployment Date  means the first day on which an Employee who has had a Separation from Service completes
an Hour of Service in a calendar year that is not a One-Year Break in Service.    (c)  Reemployment Eligibility
Computation Period  means an Eligibility Computation Period determined as if the Employee s Employment Date were his Reemployment Date.  
 6.2 If an Employee has a Separation from Service before he has met the requirements for retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3 or for a deferred
annuity under Section 4.4, he shall be deemed to have received a distribution of his entire nonforfeitable Accrued Benefit of zero dollars upon such Separation from Service and his Eligibility Years, Accrued Benefit, Benefit Years, and Vesting
Years shall be canceled.    6.3 If an Employee completes at least 1000 Hours of Service in a Reemployment Eligibility Computation Period he
shall be credited with an Eligibility Year.    6.4 (a) The Eligibility Years of an Employee whose Eligibility Years have been canceled shall
be restored if:    (1) he is credited with an Eligibility Year with respect to a Reemployment Eligibility Computation Period
that begins on or after his Reemployment Date; and    (2) he again becomes an Employee at a time when the number of
consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service he has incurred is less than the greater of five or the number of Eligibility Years the Employee had to his credit on account of his employment prior to the first One-Year Break in Service.  
 (b) If a former Employee whose Eligibility Years were not canceled under Section 6.2 or are restored under this Section
becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall become an Active Participant as of the later of the day he so becomes an Eligible Employee or the day he would have become an Active Participant under Article II if he had been an Eligible Employee at all times
since his prior Separation from Service. If a former Employee whose Eligibility Years were canceled under Section 6.2 and are not restored under this Section becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall become an Active Participant as provided in
Article II, except that his Reemployment Date shall be treated as his Employment Date.  
      64  

6.5 The Benefit Years and Accrued Benefit of an Employee whose Benefit Years have been canceled
shall be restored upon his reemployment if his Eligibility Years are restored under Section 6.4. If a Participant s Benefit Years and Accrued Benefit were not canceled pursuant to Section 6.2 upon his prior Separation from Service,
his Benefit Years earned prior to his Separation from Service shall be aggregated with his Benefit Years earned after his Reemployment Date for purposes of determining the Participant s Accrued Benefit; provided, however, that:  
 (a) if the Participant previously received a single-sum distribution under Section 5.6 on or before the close of the
second Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant s Separation from Service occurred, the Participant s Benefit Years earned prior to his Separation from Service shall be disregarded upon his reemployment; or  
 (b) if the Participant received a single-sum distribution under Section 5.6 on a date later than that described in
Paragraph (a), the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined on and after his reemployment shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the distribution received by the Participant under Section 5.6 upon his prior Separation from
Service.    6.6 The Vesting Years of an Employee whose Vesting Years have been canceled shall be restored if:  
 (a) he is credited with a Vesting Year after his Reemployment Date; and  
 (b) he again becomes an Employee at a time when the number of consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service he has incurred is less
than the greater of five or the number of Vesting Years the Employee had to his credit on account of his employment prior to the first One-Year Break in Service.  
 6.7 Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, effective January 1, 1996, an Employee who was transferred to COPCO and
whose benefits were transferred from the Plan in connection with the sale of COPCO shall receive, upon such Employee s Reemployment Date, credit for years of service with the Company prior to such transfer for purposes of calculating
Eligibility Years and Vesting Years (but not Benefit Years).    ARTICLE VII. Contributions.  
 7.1 Contributions by the Company. The Company shall contribute each year an amount actuarially determined to be sufficient to provide the
benefits under the Plan. All Company contributions to the Plan are conditioned upon their deductibility for Federal income tax purposes. The Company reserves the right, however, to reduce, suspend or discontinue its contributions under the Plan for
any reason at any time. Except as provided in this Section or Section 9.2, it shall be impossible for any part of the Company s contributions to revert to the Company, or to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of Participants, annuitants and their beneficiaries. In the case of a contribution (a) made by the Company as a mistake of fact, or (b) for which a tax deduction is disallowed, in whole or in part, by the Internal Revenue
Service, the Company shall receive a refund of said contribution within one year after payment of a contribution as a mistake of fact, or within one year after disallowance of a tax deduction, to the extent of such disallowance, as the case may be.
 
      65

the Company shall have no duty to contribute thereto except as provided in this Article.    ARTICLE VIII. Administration.

      67  

(iii) The Corporate Investment Committee and the Company s Chief Investment
Officer shall have the right at any time, with or without cause, to remove one or more employees of the Exelon Investment Office or to appoint another person or committee to act as Investment Office. Any successor Investment Office employee shall

any person acting as, or on behalf of, the Investment Office, and any member of the Corporate Investment Committee may, but need not, be an Employee, trustee or officer of an Employer and such status shall not disqualify such person from taking any
action hereunder or render such person accountable for any distribution or other material advantage received by him under this Plan, provided that no Administrator, person acting as, or on behalf of, the Investment Office, or any member of the
Corporate Investment Committee who is a Participant shall take part in any action of the Administrator or the Investment Office on any matter involving solely his rights under this Plan.  
 8.5 Notice to Trustee of Members. The Trustee shall be notified as to the names of the Administrator and the person or persons authorized to

Committee shall elect one of its members as chairman and appoint a secretary, who may or may not be a member of such Committee. All decisions of the Corporate Investment Committee shall be made by the majority, including actions taken by written
consent. The Administrator, the Investment Office and the Corporate Investment Committee may adopt such rules and procedures as it deems desirable for the conduct of its affairs, provided that any such rules and procedures shall be consistent with
the provisions of the Plan.

their acts, omissions and conduct in their official capacity with respect to the Plan (including but not limited to judgments, attorney fees and costs with respect to any and all related claims, subject to the Company s notice of and right to
direct any litigation, select any counsel or advisor, and approve any settlement), except to the extent that such effects and consequences result from their own willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification shall be in addition to (and secondary
to) such other rights such persons may enjoy as a matter of law or by reason of insurance coverage of any kind.    8.9 No Compensation. None
of the Administrator, any person employed in the Exelon Investment Office nor any member of the Corporate Investment Committee may receive any compensation or fee from the Plan for services as the Administrator, Investment Office or a member of the
Corporate Investment Committee; provided, however that nothing contained herein shall preclude the Plan from reimbursing the Company or any Affiliate for compensation paid to any such person if such compensation constitutes  direct
expenses  for purposes of ERISA. The Employers shall reimburse the Administrator, the persons employed in the Exelon Investment Office and the members of the Corporate Investment Committee for any reasonable expenditures incurred in the
discharge of their duties hereunder.    8.10 Employ of Counsel and Agents. The Administrator, the Investment Office and the Corporate
Investment Committee may employ such counsel (who may be counsel for an Employer) and agents and may arrange for such clerical and other services as each may require in carrying out its respective duties under the Plan.  
 8.11 Claims Procedures. Any Participant or distributee who believes he is entitled to benefits in an amount greater than those which he is
receiving or has received may file a claim with the Administrator (or its delegate). Such a claim shall be in writing and state the nature of the claim, the facts supporting the claim, the amount claimed, and the address of the claimant. The
Administrator (or its delegate) shall review the claim and, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, within 90 days after receipt of the claim, give notice to the claimant, either in writing by registered or certified mail or in an
electronic notification, of the decision with respect to the claim. Any electronic notice delivered to the claimant shall comply with the standards imposed by applicable regulations. If it is determined that special circumstances require an
extension of time for processing the claim, the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension exceed 90 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring
an extension of time and the date by which it is expected that the benefit determination will be rendered. The notice of the decision with respect to the claim shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if the
claim is wholly or partially denied, shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit determination and shall set forth the specific reasons for the adverse determination, the references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is
based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim, an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and a description of the claim review procedure under the Plan and the
time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502 of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. The notice shall also advise the
 
      69  

claimant that the claimant or the claimant s duly authorized representative may request a review by the Administrator (or its delegate) of the adverse benefit determination by filing, within
60 days after receipt of a notification of an adverse benefit determination, a written request for such review. The claimant shall be informed that, within the same 60-day period, he (a) may be provided, upon request and free of charge,
reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits and (b) may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim for
benefits. If a request is so filed, review of the adverse benefit determination shall be made by the Administrator (or its delegate) within, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, 60 days after receipt of such request, and the
claimant shall be given written notice of the final decision. If it is determined that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 60-day period and in
no event shall such an extension exceed 60 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the determination on review is expected to be rendered. The review shall take into
account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The notice of the final
decision shall include specific reasons for the determination and references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based and shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.  
 8.12 Actuary to Be Employed. The Company or the Investment Office shall engage an actuary to do such technical and advisory work as the
Company or the Investment Office may request, including analyses of the experience of this Plan from time to time, the preparation of actuarial tables for the making of computations thereunder, and the submission to the Company or the Investment
Office of an annual actuarial report, which report shall contain information showing the financial condition of this Plan, a statement of the contributions to be made by the Employers for the ensuing year, and such other information as may be
requested by the Company or the Investment Office.    8.13 Funding Policy. The board of directors of the Company shall establish a funding
policy and method consistent with the objectives of this Plan and the requirements of Title I of ERISA and shall communicate such policy and method, and any changes in such policy and method, to the Investment Office.  
 8.14 Notices to Participants, Etc. All notices, reports and statements given, made, delivered or transmitted to a Participant or any other
person entitled to or claiming benefits under this Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given, made or transmitted when mailed by first class mail with postage prepaid and addressed to the Participant or such other person at the address last
appearing on the records of the Administrator.    8.15 Notices to Employers or Administrator. Written directions, notices and other
communications from Participants or any other person entitled to or claiming benefits under this Plan to the Employers or Administrator shall be deemed to have been duly given, made or transmitted either when delivered to such location as shall be
specified upon the forms prescribed by the Administrator for the giving of such directions, notices and other communications or when mailed by first class mail with postage prepaid and addressed to the addressee at the address specified upon such
forms.  
      70  

8.16 Records. Each of the Administrator, the Investment Office and the Corporate Investment
Committee shall keep a record of all of their respective proceedings, if any, and shall keep or cause to be kept all books of account records and other data as may be necessary or advisable in their respective judgment for the administration of the
Plan, the administration of the investments of the Plan or the monitoring of the investment activities of the Plan, as applicable.    8.17
Responsibility to Advise Administrator of Current Address. Each person entitled to receive a payment under this Plan shall file with the Administrator in writing such person s complete mailing address and each change therein. A check or
communication mailed to any person at such person s address on file with the Administrator shall be deemed to have been received by such person for all purposes of this Plan. Although neither the Administrator nor the Trustee shall be obliged
to search for or ascertain the location of any person, the Administrator shall make reasonable efforts to locate any missing Participant or Beneficiary entitled to benefits hereunder. If the Administrator is in doubt as to whether payments are being
received by the person entitled thereto, it shall, by registered mail addressed to the person concerned at his last address known to the Administrator, notify such person that all future payments will be withheld until such person submits to the
Administrator evidence of his continued life and proper mailing address.    8.18 Electronic Media. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan
to the contrary and for all purposes of the Plan, to the extent permitted by the Administrator and any applicable law or Regulation, the use of electronic technologies shall be deemed to satisfy any written notice, consent, delivery, signature,
disclosure or recordkeeping requirement under the Plan, the Code or ERISA to the extent permitted by or consistent with applicable law and Regulations. Any transmittal by electronic technology shall be deemed delivered when successfully sent to the
recipient, or such other time specified by the Administrator.    8.19 Correction of Error. If it comes to the attention of the Administrator
that an error has been made in the amount of benefits payable, or paid, to any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, the Administrator shall be permitted to correct such error by whatever means that the Administrator, in its sole discretion
determines, including by offsetting future benefits payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or requiring repayment of benefits to the Plan, except that no adjustment need be made with respect to any Participant or Beneficiary whose benefit has
been distributed in full prior to the discovery of such error.    8.20 Applicable Law. Except to the extent preempted by applicable federal
law or otherwise provided under the terms of the Plan, the Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.  
 8.21 Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan. Except for actions to which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413
of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant receives a final decision from the Chief Human Resources
 
      71  

Officer (or such other officer designated from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and
(b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be
interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal
or equitable action against any party.    8.22 Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan. Any legal action involving the Plan that is brought
by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the federal courts located in the Northern District of Illinois or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whichever is most convenient, and no other federal or state court.
   8.23 Legal Fees. Any award of legal fees in connection with an action involving the Plan shall be calculated pursuant to a method that
results in the lowest amount of fees being paid, which amount shall be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to (a) administrative proceedings under the Plan, (b) unsuccessful
claims brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or (c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be no enhancement for the risk of contingency, nonpayment or any other risk
nor shall there be applied a contingency multiplier or any other multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the Administrator, the Investment Office, the Corporate Investment Committee, any
Plan fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, any Plan administrator, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan Parties ), legal fees of the Plan Parties in connection with
such action shall be paid by the Participant, Beneficiary or other person bringing the action, unless the court specifically finds that there was a reasonable basis for the action.  
 ARTICLE IX. Amendment and Termination.    9.1
Amendment. Exelon Corporation may amend the Plan at any time for any reason. Each amendment to the Plan shall be adopted by Exelon Corporation s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof); provided, however, that in the case of any amendment
or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the
case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater responsibility. If an
amendment changes the vesting provisions of the Plan, any person who is a Participant on the later of the date the amendment is adopted or becomes effective shall have at all times a vested interest in his Accrued Benefit as of that date determined
without regard to the amendment. In addition, within a reasonable period determined by the Exelon Corporation in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, any Participant who has at least three Vesting Years to his credit
on the last day of the election period may elect to have his vested interest in his entire Accrued Benefit determined without regard to the amendment. Except as otherwise permitted by law, no amendment shall reduce a Participant s Accrued
Benefit nor result in the elimination or reduction of a benefit  protected  under Section 411(d)(6) of the Code.  
      72  

9.2 Termination. Exelon Corporation may terminate or partially terminate the Plan through
resolutions adopted by Exelon Corporation s Board of Directors. If the Plan is terminated or partially terminated, the assets of the Plan shall be allocated, subject to Section 9.3, as provided in Section 4044 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as it may be from time to time amended or construed by any appropriate governmental agency or corporation), without subclasses. Any amount remaining after all fixed and contingent liabilities of the Plan have
been satisfied shall be returned to Exelon Corporation. Allocations under this Section shall be nonforfeitable. Except as otherwise required by law, the time and manner of distribution of the assets shall be determined by Exelon Corporation by
amendment to the Plan pursuant to Section 9.1.    9.3 Limitation on Benefits. The following provisions shall be effective with respect
to distributions made on or after May 14, 1990; distributions made prior to May 14, 1990 shall be subject to the restrictions described in Treas. Reg.  1.401-4(c).  
 (a) In the event of Plan termination, the benefit payable to any Highly Compensated Employee shall be limited to a benefit that
is nondiscriminatory under Section 401(a)(4) of the Code. If payment of benefits is restricted in accordance with this Paragraph (a), assets in excess of the amount required to provided such restricted benefits shall become a part of the assets
available under Section 9.2 for allocation among Participants and beneficiaries of Participants whose benefits are not restricted under this Paragraph (a).  
 (b) The restrictions of this Paragraph (b) shall apply prior to termination of the Plan to any Participant who is a Highly
Compensated Employee and who is one of the 25 highest paid employees or former employees of the Company and all Affiliates for any Plan Year. The annual payments made from the Plan on behalf of any such Participant shall be limited to an amount
equal to (1) the payments that would have been made under a single life annuity that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the sum of the Participant s Accrued Benefit and any other benefits under the Plan (other than a social security
supplement) and (2) the payments that the Participant is entitled to receive under a social security supplement.    (c)
The restrictions in Paragraph (b) shall not apply:    (1) if, after the payment of benefits to or on behalf of such
Participant, the value of the Plan assets equals or exceeds 110 percent of the value of the current liabilities (within the meaning of Section 412(l)(7) of the Code);  
 (2) if the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Participant is less than one percent (1%) of the value of
current liabilities before distribution; or    (3) if the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Participant
does not exceed $5,000.  
      73  

ARTICLE X. Miscellaneous.  
 10.1 Forfeitures. All forfeitures arising under the Plan shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the Company s contributions and shall
not be applied to increase the benefits any person would otherwise receive under the Plan.    10.2 Mergers, Etc. No merger or consolidation
with, or transfer of any of the Plan s assets or liabilities to, any other plan shall occur at any time unless each Participant and annuitant would (if the Plan had then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation,
or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated).  
 10.3 Nonalienation of Benefits. Except (a) to the extent permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
(b) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (c) to the extent required to satisfy a Federal tax levy made pursuant to Section 6331 of the Code, or (d) effective as of January 1, 1997, pursuant to
Section 401(a)(13) of the Code, to the extent a judgment relates to the Participant s conviction of a crime involving the Plan, or a judgment, order, decree or settlement agreement between the Participant and the Secretary of Labor or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relates to a violation of part 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, no benefit under this Plan may be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or alienated. Notwithstanding the above, a Participant may authorize the
Administrator to deduct from benefit payments under the Plan up to 10% of each such payment as contributions to a Company political action committee. Any such authorization shall be revocable by the Participant at any time.  
 10.4 Effect on Employment. This Plan shall not confer upon any person any right to be continued in the employment of the Company.  
 10.5 Facility of Payment. If the Company deems any person incapable of receiving benefits to which he is entitled by reason of minority,
illness, infirmity, or other incapacity, it may direct that payment be made directly for the benefit of such person or to any person selected by the Company to disburse it, whose receipt shall be a complete acquittance therefor. Such payments shall,
to the extent thereof, discharge all liability of the Company and the party making the payment.    10.6 Lost Payees. If a Participant,
Spouse or other beneficiary to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan cannot be located following a reasonable effort to do so by the Administrator, such benefit shall be forfeited. Whether or not efforts to locate a Participant have previously
been made, the Administrator shall make reasonable efforts to locate the Participant (or the Spouse of a deceased Participant) during the one-year period preceding the Participant s Required Beginning Date. If such efforts fail to locate the
Participant or Spouse, such Participant or Spouse shall be presumed dead as of the Required Beginning Date and any benefit payable to the Participant or Spouse shall be forfeited. In any case, if a claim for a forfeited benefit is subsequently filed
by the Participant, Spouse or beneficiary, such benefit shall be reinstated and paid in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Plan.  
      74  

10.7 Effective Date. The provisions of this instrument apply only to individuals who complete an
Hour of Service on or after the effective date stated under the title of the Plan on page one. The eligibility and benefits of any other person shall be determined under the Plan as in effect when he last separated from service except as expressly
provided with respect to him by amendment adopted thereafter; and except that the provisions of Section 2.10 (relating to rehire of Employees), Section 2.11 (relating to change in employment status or transfer to affiliate),
Section 4.6 (relating to maximum annuity), Section 4.12 (relating to benefit restrictions as a result of funding), Article VIII (relating to administration), Article IX (relating to amendment and termination of the Plan), and this Article
X (relating to miscellaneous provisions) shall be effective for all such persons.    10.8 Expenses. The expenses of the Trustee in the
administration of the Trust, including compensation, if any, to the Trustee for its services, shall be paid by the Company or the Employers. All costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Trust, to the extent not described in the preceding
sentence, and all costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Plan and the Trust, including, but not limited to,  direct expenses  incurred in administering the Plan and the Trust (including compensation paid to any employee of an
Employer or an Affiliate who is engaged in the administration of the Plan or the Trust), the expenses of the Administrator, the Investment Office and the Corporate Investment Committee, the fees of counsel and any agents for the Trustee, the
Administrator, the Investment Office or the Corporate Investment Committee, and the fees of investment managers that manage assets of the Trust shall be paid by the Trustee from the Trust in such proportion as the Investment Office, in its sole
discretion, shall determine, to the extent such expenses are not paid by the Employers and to the extent permitted under ERISA, Regulations and other applicable laws. Any such expenses that are borne by the Employers shall be paid out of their own
funds in such proportions as the Administrator shall determine. In the event that the Company or any other Employer advances money on behalf of the Trust for the payment of any expenses incurred in the operation of the Plan, the Trustee shall
reimburse the Company or such other Employer from the Trust for any amount so advanced, without interest or fees.    ARTICLE XI. Top-Heavy Provisions.  
 11.1 Definitions. Whenever used in this Article:  
  Determination Date  means, with respect to any Plan Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year.  
  Key Employee  means any Participant who, at any time during the Plan Year or any of the four preceding Plan Years, is an individual
described in Section 416(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.     Permissive Aggregation Group  means a group of
qualified retirement plans maintained by the Company or any Affiliate, which group consists of the Required Aggregation group and any other plan or plans which, considered together with the Required Aggregation Group, meet the requirements of
Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.  
      75  

Required Aggregation Group  means the group of qualified retirement plans maintained
by the Company or an Affiliate, including a frozen plan or a plan that has been terminated during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, which group consists of this Plan, each other plan in which a Key Employee is a participant (or,
in the case of a terminated plan was a participant in such five-year period) and each other plan that enables any such plan to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code, but only if such group includes this Plan. Otherwise,
the Required Aggregation Group consists of this Plan only.     Top-Heavy Plan Year  means a Plan Year that begins after
December 31, 1983, in which the Plan is top-heavy. The Plan is top-heavy for a given Plan Year if for that Plan Year (1) the Required Aggregation Group is top-heavy, and (2) the Required Aggregation Group is not part of a Permissive
Aggregation Group that is not top-heavy. The Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group (the  Group ) is top-heavy for a given Plan Year if the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits (or, the aggregate of the
accounts, in the case of a defined contribution plan included in such Group) of participants who are Key Employees exceeds 60% of the like amount determined for all participants in all plans included in such Group. For purposes of this definition:
   (a) the present value of the accrued benefit or the account of any participant shall be increased by the amount of all
plan distributions to such participant during the five year period ending on the Determination Date; provided that no such increase shall arise from any rollover contribution or plan-to-plan transfer from this Plan that is not initiated by the
participant or is made to another plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate;    (b) the present value of the accrued
benefit or the account of a participant who has been a Key Employee but no longer is a Key Employee shall not be taken into account;  
 (c) the present value of the accrued benefit or the account of any Participant who has not performed services for the Company
or an Affiliate at any time during the five-year period that ends on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account;  
 (d) any rollover contribution or plan-to-plan transfer to this Plan that is initiated by a participant and made from a plan
that is not maintained by the Company or an Affiliate after December 31, 1983 shall not be taken into account;    (e)
the five year period referenced above shall be changed to a one year period for all distributions made on account of a severance from employment, death, or disability; and  
 (f) the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined, effective January 1, 1987, under the method used for
accrual purposes for all plans maintained by the Company and all Affiliates if a single method is used by all such plans, or, otherwise, the slowest accrual method permitted under Section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.  
      76  

11.2 Top-Heavy Operating Rules. Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the
following rules shall apply in a Top-Heavy Plan Year:    (a) For purposes of determining benefits under this Article XI,
 compensation  shall mean compensation as reported on Forms W-2 by the Company or any Affiliate for such Plan Year and the maximum amount of compensation of any Participant who is an Employee during such Plan Year shall be $150,000, or
such other amount as may apply to such Participant pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder.  
 (b) For purposes of determining the maximum annuity in Section 4.6 for Plan years beginning before January 1, 2000,
 1.0  shall be substituted for  1.25 , wherever it appears.    (c) The Accrued Benefit which each
Participant who is an Employee but not a Key Employee under this Plan derives from contributions by the Company shall be increased by the amount necessary to cause the Accrued Benefits payable to each Participant in such year, when expressed as a
benefit payable annually in the form of a Single Life Annuity, to equal at least the required minimum benefit, where the required minimum benefit is the product of:  
 (1) the average of the Participant s compensation for the five consecutive Plan Years that yield the highest average,
disregarding Plan Years which begin before January 1, 1984, and Plan Years which are not Top-Heavy Plan Years, and  
 (2) the lesser of:  
 (A) 2 percent multiplied by the number of Vesting Years with the Company which were also Top-Heavy Plan Years and which were
completed after January 1, 1984; or    (B) 20 percent.  
 For purposes of determining whether an increase in benefit accrual is required, all plans included in the Required Aggregation Group shall be treated as one
plan.    (d) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in any Top-Heavy Plan Year, a Participant who does not
otherwise have a nonforfeitable right to 100% of his Accrued Benefit shall have a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of his Accrued Benefit in accordance with the following schedule:  

77  

In any Plan Year following the last Top-Heavy Plan Year, any Employee who is a Participant on the
last day of the last Top-Heavy Plan Year shall have at all times a vested interest in his Accrued Benefit as of that date determined under the schedule set forth above. In addition, within a reasonable period determined by the Company, any
Participant who has at least three Vesting Years to his credit on that date may elect to have his vested interest in his entire Accrued Benefit determined under the schedule set forth above.  
 ARTICLE XII. Post Retirement Health Benefits.  
 12.1 Eligibility  
 (a) Effective December 1, 1994, post-retirement health befits may be paid under this Article, to the extent the Company
elects to fund benefits under this Article, to any Participant, who is receiving or has received pension benefits under this Plan, and if applicable, to the Spouse or dependents of such Participant; provided, however, that the Company may, in its
discretion, decide not to provide post-retirement health benefits under this Article for Key Employees (as defined in Section 11.1) and, if applicable, their Spouses and dependents.  
 (b) In addition to satisfying the requirements of Subsection (a), any person claiming post-retirement health benefits under
this Plan must meet all applicable requirements imposed in the post-retirement health plans maintained by the Company. All determinations of benefit levels and eligibility for benefits shall be made pursuant to the terms of such post-retirement
health plans.    (c) The establishment of an account under this Article XII to provide payment for post-retirement health
benefits shall not obligate the Company to maintain its post-retirement health plans, and the Company shall retain the same ability to amend or terminate such post-retirement health plans as if this Article XII did not exist.  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, post-retirement health benefits shall not be available for any Power Team Employee.  
 12.2 Benefits Provided.  
 (a) Benefits under this Article shall include all health benefits provided by the post-retirement health plans maintained by
the Company, including payment of Medicare Part B premiums to the extent provided by such post-retirement health plans, to the extent such benefits are not otherwise provided by the Company.  
 (b) Benefits under this Article shall be provided using any method or combination of methods as the Company shall deem
appropriate, including, but not limited to , purchase of insurance and the payment of premiums for such insurance, direct reimbursement of costs incurred by the provider of such benefits or reimbursement to the individual to whom such benefits were
provided.  
      78  

(c) Benefits and coverage under this Article shall not be discriminatory in favor
of officers, shareholders, supervisory employees or highly compensated employees.    12.3 Establishment of Accounts.  
 (a) A separate account shall be maintained with respect to the contributions to fund benefits under this Article. This account
is to be maintained for accounting purposes only. Funds accounted for in such account may be invested on a commingled basis with pension benefit contributions under this Plan without identification of which investments are allocable to each account,
provided that earnings on all Plan assets are allocated in a reasonable manner.    (b) If the Company elects to fund
post-retirement health benefits for Key Employees under this Article, as separate account shall be maintained for post-retirement health benefits payable to each Key Employee, his Spouse and dependents. Benefits under this Article shall be payable
to such Key Employee, Spouse and dependents only from such account. The separate account maintained under this Subsection (b) shall be a true separate account, and not maintained merely for accounting purposes. Commingling of assets held in
such account with any other Plan assets is not permitted. For purposes of Section 415 of the Code contributions allocated to any separate account under this Subsection (b) shall be treated as an annual addition to a defined contribution
plan.    12.4 Funding.  
 (a) Contributions to provide benefits under this Article may be contributory or non-contributory, in accordance with the terms
of the post-retirement health plans maintained by the Company.    (b) Amounts contributed to fund post-retirement health
benefits shall be reasonable and ascertainable. The total amount contributed to fund post-retirement health benefits under this Article shall not exceed the cost of providing such benefits. The total cost of providing such benefits shall be
determined in accordance with a generally accepted actuarial method selected by the Company which is reasonable in view of the provisions and coverage of the Plan, the funding medium and other relevant considerations, including, but not limited to,
applicable Treasury regulations. For purposes of determining the cost of providing post-retirement health benefits, the actuarial method may take into account reasonable projected increases in the cost of providing health benefits. Forfeitures, if
any, under this Article shall be applied as soon as possible to reduce employer contributions to fund benefits under this Article.  
 (c) Post-retirement health benefits provided under this Article, when added to life insurance protection provided under the
Plan, shall be incidental and subordinate to pension benefits provided under the Plan. For purposes of this Article, post-retirement health benefits shall be considered incidental and subordinate if the aggregate of the contributions for
post-retirement health benefits provided under this Article plus the contributions for life insurance protection under this Plan does not exceed 25 percent of the total contributions to the Plan (other than for past service credit) made on or after
December 1, 1994.  
      79  

(d) Until the satisfaction of all liabilities to be provided under this Article,
neither amounts contributed to fund post-retirement health benefits under this Article nor earnings thereon shall be used for or diverted to any purpose other than providing such benefits or payment of necessary or appropriate expenses attributable
to the administration of post-retirement health accounts under this Article. Any amounts contributed to fund medical benefits under this Article remaining in a post-retirement health account after the satisfaction of all liabilities arising under
this Article must be returned to the Company.    (e) Nothing in this Article shall obligate the Company to pay benefits
described in Section 12.2 to the extent those benefits exceed assets contributed to the Fund to provide post-retirement health benefits under this Article. Furthermore, nothing in this Article shall imply that amounts contributed to the Fund to
provide pension or other benefits (other than post-retirement health benefits) available under the Plan will be used to provide post-retirement health benefits under this Article. The Company may, in its discretion, fund all or any part of the
benefits described in Section 12.2 from other sources or may pay such benefits out of its general assets as the benefits become payable.  
 (f) If in any proceeding subsequent to December 1, 1994, under Section 1308 of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code,
the Company is not permitted to fully recover in rates the contributions made to the separate account maintained to fund benefits under this Article, the Company, at its discretion, may elect to defer or discontinue funding the benefits under this
Article.  
      80  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized
officer on this            day of December, 2012.

under this Plan shall mean a benefit of equivalent value when computed using a 7% interest rate and the mortality tables attached to the Plan as Exhibit A (for pensioners) and B (for beneficiaries, if applicable), with such exceptions as
specifically set forth in the Plan.    For distributions on and after December 1, 2012, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a
Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 only shall be determined using (i) the interest rate used shall be the interest rate as defined in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the fifth month (or, if more
favorable to the recipient of a lump sum payment between December 1, 2012 and December 1, 2013), the second month) preceding the calendar year in which such distribution is made or commences and (ii) the mortality table shall be the
mortality table specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Benefit Commencement Date occurs. For distributions on or
after January 1, 2008 and on or before November 30, 2012, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 shall be determined by using (i) the interest rate as defined in

Section 417(e)(3) of the Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Benefit Commencement Date occurs.    For
distributions on or after January 1, 2000 and on or before December 31, 2007, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 shall be determined using the annual rate of interest
on 30-year Treasury securities as specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 417(e)(3)(A) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder for the second full calendar month preceding the first day of the
Plan Year containing the date of distribution, and the mortality table shall be the mortality table prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 417(e)(3)(A) of the Code on the date as of which the single sum
payment is being determined, if the use of such assumptions would result in a greater benefit.    For the period beginning on or after
January 1, 2000, and ending on or before December 31, 2001, and ending on the date of adoption of this amendment and restatement, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6
shall be determined on the basis of the assumptions which would be used as of the first day of the Plan Year containing the date of distribution by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a lump sum
distribution upon plan termination, if the use of such assumptions would result in a greater benefit.

she has completed three months of employment with an Employer (regardless of the  
      7  

number of Hours of Service actually performed). Each other Eligible Employee who is not a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 shall be eligible to become a Participant
on the first day of the payroll period coinciding with or next following the date of his or her employment.     Section 3.2 .
 Applications for Before-Tax Contributions and After-Tax Contributions .    (a)  Regular Payroll Before-Tax and After-Tax
Contributions . Each Eligible Employee who desires to commence Before-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions shall make a request in the manner prescribed by the Administrator specifying the Employee s chosen rate of Before-Tax
Contributions for each payroll period or his or her chosen rate of After-Tax Contributions for each payroll period, or both. Such request shall authorize the Employee s Employer to reduce the Eligible Employee s Compensation by the amount
of any such Before-Tax Contributions, to make regular payroll deductions of any such After-Tax Contributions or both, as the case may be. The request shall also specify the Employee s investment elections pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and
shall evidence the Employee s acceptance of and agreement to all provisions of the Plan. In addition, an Eligible Employee who is not a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 on the date of his or her employment may
elect, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a), to become a Participant on the first day of the payroll period coinciding with or next following such date. All requests to commence contributions pursuant to this paragraph
(a) shall be effective as of such time after the Administrator (or its delegate) receives such request as shall be established by the Administrator,  provided , that all such requests shall be effective on the first day of a payroll period
commencing not more than 30 days after receipt thereof by the Administrator (or its delegate).  
      8  

(b)  Quarterly Incentive Award Before-Tax Contributions . With respect to quarterly
incentive awards earned prior to January 1, 2002, each Eligible Employee may request, in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to reduce his or her compensation by an amount equal to 100 percent of any such quarterly incentive awards that
would otherwise be paid to such Participant; provided, however, that for the 2001 Plan Year, such reduction shall be available solely with respect to quarterly incentive awards payable on or after the later of (i) March 31, 2001 and
(ii) the first date thereafter which the Administrator determines is administratively practicable with respect to Employees of such Participant s Employer. Before-Tax Contributions pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be invested in
accordance with the Participant s investment election under paragraph (a) of this Section 3.2 (or, if no such election is in effect, in accordance with an investment election made by such Participant in the manner prescribed by the
Administrator).    (c)  Automatic Enrollment for Certain Employees . (i)  Deemed Election of Default Before-Tax
Contributions . A Participant whose hire date is on or after April 6, 2009 and who does not make an election pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 3.2 to make Before-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions shall be deemed
to have elected to make Before-Tax Contributions ( Default Before-Tax Contributions ) equal to 3 percent ( Default Percentage ) of his or her Compensation for each payroll period and to have his or her Employer reduce his or her
Compensation by the amount thereof. Such Participant s Default Percentage will increase by 1 percent each Plan Year, beginning with the second Plan Year that begins after the Default Percentage first applies to the Participant, until it reaches
5 percent. The increase will be effective March 1 of each applicable Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Participant s initial Default Before-Tax Contribution occurs during the period commencing on December 1 and
ending the last day of February, the initial increase to such Participant s Default Percentage shall commence on the March 1 of the calendar year following the first anniversary of the Participant s initial Default Before-Tax
Contribution. The effective date of such Participant s deemed election shall be 90 days after the Participant receives a notice of his or her rights and obligations under  
      9  

this paragraph (c)(i) (the  Automatic Enrollment Notice ). During the 90-day period after the Participant receives the Automatic Enrollment Notice, the Participant shall have an
opportunity to make an affirmative election to (1) not have any Default Before-Tax Contributions made on his or her behalf or (2) have Before-Tax Contributions made in a different amount or percentage of Compensation by giving direction to
the Administrator (or its delegate) in the manner prescribed by the Administrator. Any deemed election described in this paragraph (c)(i) shall be effective only with respect to Compensation not currently available to the Participant. Each
Participant whose hire date is on or after April 6, 2009 shall be a  covered employee  for purposes of section 1.414(w)-1(e)(3) of the Regulations, regardless of whether such Participant makes an affirmative election regarding

to have Before-Tax Contributions made in addition to those described in paragraph (a) of this Section 4.1 ( Additional Before-Tax Contributions ) if no other Before-Tax Contributions to be made pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this Section 4.1 may be made to the Plan for such payroll period by reason of the limitations of Section 4.2 (relating to the 402(g) annual limit on Before-Tax Contributions). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall the

      14  

Code and otherwise as the Administrator determines. To the extent such Additional Before-Tax Contributions are not  Catch-Up Contributions  as defined for purposes of section 414(v) of
the Code, they shall be taken into account, and to the extent such Additional Before-Tax Contributions are Catch-Up Contributions they shall not be taken into account, for purposes of Article 4 or 7 or other provisions of the Plan implementing the
required limitations of sections 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 402(g), 404, 410(b), 415 or 416 of the Code, as applicable.

403(b) of the Code, and excluding any Additional Before-Tax Contributions made to the Plan pursuant to paragraph (d) of Section 4.1 which are Catch-Up Contributions described in such paragraph or Default Before-Tax Contributions that are
withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 3.2, shall not exceed the applicable dollar amount under section 402(g) of the Code (as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with section 402(g)(5) of the Code) for such calendar
year.    (b)  Correction of Excess Before-Tax Contributions . If for any calendar year a Participant determines that the aggregate of
the (i) Before-Tax Contributions to this Plan, excluding any Additional Before-Tax Contributions made to the Plan pursuant to paragraph (d) of Section 4.1 which are Catch-Up Contributions described in such paragraph, and
(ii) amounts contributed under other plans or arrangements described in sections 401(k), 408(k) or 403(b) of the Code will exceed the limit imposed by paragraph (a) of this Section 4.2 for the calendar year in which such contributions
were made ( Excess Before-Tax Contributions ), such Participant shall, pursuant to such rules and at such time following such calendar year as determined by the  
      15  

Administrator, be allowed to submit a written request that the Excess Before-Tax Contributions plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto be distributed to him or her. The request
described in this subsection shall be made in the manner and form prescribed by the Administrator and shall state the amount of the Participant s Excess Before-Tax Contributions for the calendar year. The request shall be accompanied by the
Participant s written statement that if such Excess Before-Tax Contributions are not distributed, such Excess Before-Tax Contributions, when added to amounts deferred under other plans or arrangements described under sections 401(k), 408(k), or
403(b) of the Code, excluding any contributions which are Catch-Up Contributions described in section 414(v) of the Code, will exceed the limit for such Participant under section 402(g) of the Code. A distribution of Excess Before-Tax Contributions
(reduced by any amounts recharacterized or distributed pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of Section 4.4 (relating to adjustments to comply with section 401(k)(3) of the Code)) shall be made no later than the applicable time period set forth in the
Code and Regulations thereunder following the end of the Plan Year for which such Excess Before-Tax Contributions were made, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto through the end of such Plan Year. The amount of any income or loss
allocable to such Excess Before-Tax Contributions shall be determined pursuant to applicable Regulations. If Excess Before-Tax Contributions are distributed pursuant to this Section 4.2, any corresponding Employer Matching Contributions
allocated to the Participant s Employer Matching Contributions Account, adjusted for income or loss pursuant to Regulations, to which such Participant would be entitled under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of
employment) if such Participant had terminated employment on the last day of the calendar year during which contributions were made (or earlier if such Participant actually terminated employment at an earlier date) shall be distributed to such
Participant and any remaining amount of such corresponding Employer Matching Contributions, adjusted for income or loss, shall be forfeited.  
      16  

Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, any such Excess Before-Tax Contributions shall be treated as  annual additions  for purposes of Section 7.4 (relating to
limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code) and shall not be disregarded as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining the average deferral percentage described in Section 4.4(d)(1) or, to the extent applicable, the
average contribution percentage described in Section 4.4(d)(2), except that in the case of a non-highly compensated eligible employee, as that term is defined in Section 4.4(d)(4), such Excess Before-Tax Contributions shall be ignored to
the extent that such contributions are prohibited pursuant to section 401(a)(30) of the Code, which requires that Before-Tax Contributions not exceed the limit described in paragraph (a) of Section 4.2 (relating to the annual limit on
Before-Tax Contributions). Any distribution of Excess Before-Tax Contributions to a Participant shall be treated as a distribution of the Untaxed Contributions, up to the extent Untaxed Contributions have been made by such Participant to the Plan
for such Plan Year and, to the extent that distributions of Excess Before-Tax Contributions to such Participant exceed the Participant s Untaxed Contributions for such Plan Year, the distributions of Excess Before-Tax Contributions shall be
treated as Designated Roth Contributions made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year.    (c)  Untaxed Contributions and
Designated Roth Contributions.  Effective for Before-Tax Contributions made (i) in the case of a Participant who is not a Local 15 Member, for the 2006 Plan Year and thereafter, and (ii) in the case of a Participant who is a Local 15
Member, for the 2009 Plan Year and thereafter, an election made by a Participant to commence, change, suspend or resume Before-Tax Contributions pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall designate the portion of such contributions that are to be
Designated Roth Contributions includible in the Participant s gross income when made pursuant to section 402A of the Code. Such designation is irrevocable with respect to contributions made or to be made with respect to Compensation
 
      17  

currently available. Any such election made by a Participant which does not expressly designate a portion of Before-Tax Contributions as Designated Roth Contributions shall be deemed to designate
no portion of Before-Tax Contributions as Designated Roth Contributions. Any Before-Tax Contributions that are not Designated Roth Contributions are referred to herein as Untaxed Contributions.  
  Section 4.3 .  Employer Matching Contributions .  
 (a)  Amount of Contributions . Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.4 (relating to limitations on contributions for highly

employment during which the Employee is employed by an Employer ending on the monthly anniversary of the Employee s date of hire. A Participant who is credited with an additional month of service during a pay period and becomes eligible to
receive an increased Employer Matching Contribution, shall not be entitled to receive an increased Employer Matching Contribution until the first full payroll period following the payroll period in which such Participant is credited with such
additional month of service;    
      18  

(iii) 
 For each Participant who is classified as a non-exempt craft employee or clerical employee assigned to the Peachbottom, Limerick, Outage Services East or Texas generating plant, an amount equal to 100 percent of Matched

eligible to receive a  Profit Sharing Matching Contribution,  provided that such Participant either (i) is an Employee of such Employer on the last day of such Plan Year, (ii) is not employed on such day as a result of an
approved unpaid leave of absence during such Plan Year, (iii) terminates employment during such Plan Year (1) after attaining age 50 and completing at least 10 years of service, as determined by the Administrator, (2) as a result of
circumstances entitling the Participant to separation benefits under an Employer s severance benefit plan, (3) as a result of a disability that entitles the Participant to benefits under an Employer s long-term disability plan, or
(4) on account of the Participant s death. The  Profit Sharing Matching Contribution  shall be an amount (if any) determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Compensation Committee thereof) in its sole discretion
based on attainment of specified performance goals, and not exceeding 60% of a Participant s Matched Contributions, as defined below, for each payroll period, but only to the extent that such Matched Contributions do not exceed 5 percent of the
Participant s Compensation for the payroll period.

Participant in an amount equal to the amount described in clause (iii) above assuming that such Participant had continued making the same rate of Before-Tax Contributions that were in effect with respect to such Participant at the time such
Before-Tax Contributions exceeded the limit described in Section 4.2.    (b)  Special Part-Time Employees . Notwithstanding

 one-hundredth  of one percent, of the Before-Tax Contributions made for the benefit of such Eligible Employee to the total compensation paid to such Eligible Employee for the portion of such Plan Year during
which such Eligible Employee was a Participant, except that no Additional Before-Tax Contributions which are  Catch-Up Contributions  described in paragraph (d) of Section 4.1 or Default Before-Tax Contributions that are
withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 3.2 shall be considered as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining a Participant s average deferral percentage;    

(2) 
 the  average contribution percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios, calculated separately for each Eligible Employee in such group to the
nearest  one-hundredth  of one percent, of the Employer Matching Contributions made, After-Tax Contributions made and, in the Administrator s sole discretion, to the extent permitted under Regulations or
otherwise under the Code, the Before-Tax Contributions made during such year for the benefit of such Eligible Employee, except that no Additional Before-Tax Contributions which are  Catch-Up Contributions  described in paragraph
(d) of Section 4.1, shall be considered as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining a Participant s average contribution percentage, to such Eligible Employee s compensation for the portion of such Plan Year during
which such Eligible Employee was a Participant;        

(3) 
 the term  highly compensated eligible employee  shall mean any Eligible Employee who is a Participant, who performs service in the determination year and who (a) is a 5%-owner (as determined under section
416(i)(1)(A)(iii) of the Code) at any time during the Plan Year or the preceding Plan Year or (b) both (1) is paid compensation in excess of $80,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 414(q) of the
Code) from an Employer for the preceding Plan Year, and (2) is in the group of employees consisting of the top 20% of the employees of the Employer and its Affiliates when ranked on the basis of compensation paid during such preceding Plan
Year;        

(4) 
 the term  non-highly compensated eligible employee  shall mean any Eligible Employee who is a Participant, who performs services in the determination year and is not a highly compensated eligible employee;

(5) 
 the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in section 414(s) of the Code or, in the discretion of the Administrator, any other meaning in accordance with the Code for these purposes, except that
for purposes of determining whether an Eligible Employee is a  highly compensated eligible employee , as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this Section 4.4,  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in section 415(c)(3)
of the Code;    
      23  

(6) 
 if this Plan and one or more other plans of the Employer to which Before-Tax Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, or qualified nonelective contributions (as such term is defined in section 401(m)(4)(C) of the Code)
are made are treated as one plan for purposes of section 410(b) of the Code, such plans shall be treated as one plan for purposes of this Section. If a highly compensated eligible employee participates in this Plan and one or more other plans of the
Employer to which any such contributions are made, all such contributions shall be aggregated for purposes of this Section 4.4; and        

(7) 
 if this Plan benefits Employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and employees who are not included in such collective bargaining unit, this Plan shall be treated as
comprising two or more separate plans, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with applicable Regulations, for purposes of this Section 4.4. If such other plan has a plan year that is different from the Plan Year of this Plan, then
the highly compensated eligible employee s contributions made to such other plan during the Plan Year of this Plan shall be aggregated with contributions of the same type made to this Plan for such Plan Year for purposes of determining the
average deferral percentage and average contribution percentage for this Plan for such Plan Year for the group of highly compensated eligible employees.    
 This paragraph is inserted at the request of the Internal Revenue Service in order to obtain a favorable determination letter. In computing
the  average deferral percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year, the Before-Tax Contributions that will be taken into account for such Plan Year will be only those that relate to compensation that would have
been received by the Eligible Employee in the Plan Year or is attributable to services performed by the Eligible Employee in the Plan Year and would have been received by the Eligible Employee within 2-1/2 months after the close of the Plan Year. In
computing the  average contribution percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year, (i) an After-Tax Contribution will be taken into account only if it is paid to the Trust during such Plan Year or paid to
an agent of the Plan and transmitted to the Trust within a reasonable time after the end of the Plan Year; (ii) an excess contribution that is recharacterized will be taken into account during the Plan Year in which the contribution would have
been received in cash by the Eligible Employee had  
      24  

the Eligible Employee not elected to defer the contribution; (iii) an Employer Matching Contribution will be taken into account only if it is made on account of the Eligible Employee s
Before-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions, allocated to the Eligible Employee s Account as of a date within that Plan Year and paid to the Trust by the end of the twelfth month following the close of such Plan Year; and
(iv) qualified matching contributions which are used to meet the requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A) of the Code are not to be taken into account for purposes of the actual deferral percentage test of section 401(m) of the Code. To the extent
required by law, the following will be treated as separate plans for purposes of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) of the Code: (i) the portion of the Plan that is a 401(k) plan, (ii) the portion of the Plan that is a section 401(m) plan;
(iii) the portion of the plan that provides for contributions other than elective, employee or matching; (iv) the portion of the Plan that is an ESOP; and (v) the portion of the plan that is not an ESOP.  
 (e)  Adjustments to Comply with Limits .  
 (1)  Adjustments to Comply with Section 401(k)(3) of the Code . The Administrator shall cause to be made such periodic computations
as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether either of the tests set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied during a Plan Year, and, if it appears to the Administrator that neither of such
tests will be satisfied, the Administrator shall take such steps as it deems necessary or appropriate to reduce or otherwise adjust the Before-Tax Contributions contributed or to be contributed for all or a portion of such Plan Year on behalf of
Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees to the extent necessary in order for one of such tests to be satisfied. If, as of the end of the Plan Year, the Administrator determines that, notwithstanding any adjustments made pursuant
to the  
      25  

preceding sentence, neither of the tests set forth in paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied with respect to such Plan Year, the total amount by which Before-Tax
Contributions must be reduced in order to satisfy either such test shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by section 401(k)(8)(B) of the Code (the  excess contributions amount ). The Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of the
Participant who is a highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions is the highest shall be reduced until such dollar amount equals the next highest actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions
made for such Plan Year on behalf of any highly compensated employee, or until the total reduction equals the excess contributions amount. If further reductions are necessary, then the Before-Tax Contributions on behalf of each Participant who is a
highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions is the highest (after the reduction described in the preceding sentence) shall be reduced in accordance with the previous sentence. Such reductions shall
continue to be made to the extent necessary so that the total reduction equals the excess contributions amount.    To the extent that the
sum of such reductions with respect to a Participant and the amount of other After-Tax Contributions allocated to such Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account does not exceed 20 percent (10 percent in the case of a Participant who is a
member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15) of the Participant s Compensation, the amount of such reductions shall be treated as an After-Tax Contribution. To the extent such amount cannot be treated as an After-Tax
Contribution because of the limitation described in the preceding sentence, such amount, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto through the end of the Plan Year for which the After-Tax Contribution was made, shall be distributed to
such Participant no later than  
      26  

the last day of the subsequent Plan Year and the Participant shall forfeit any corresponding Employer Matching Contributions related thereto plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto
through the end of the Plan Year for which the Employer Matching Contribution was made. The Participant shall designate the extent to which such distributed excess contributions are treated as Untaxed Contributions or Designated Roth Contributions
(but only up to the extent that such types of contributions were made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year) and, in the event that any such designation is not made or is incomplete, such distributed excess contributions shall be treated
as Untaxed Contributions up to the extent Untaxed Contributions were made to the Plan for the Plan Year and, to the extent that such distributed excess contributions exceed such Untaxed Contributions, such excess contributions shall be treated as
distributions of Designated Roth Contributions made to the Plan for the Plan Year.    The amount of Before-Tax Contributions to be
distributed to a Participant pursuant to this Section shall be reduced by any Before-Tax Contributions previously distributed to such Participant pursuant to Section 4.2(b) (relating to correction of Excess Before-Tax Contributions) for such
Plan Year. The amount of any income or loss allocable to any such reductions to be so distributed shall be determined pursuant to Regulations. The unadjusted amount of any such reductions so distributed shall be treated as  annual
additions  for purposes of Section 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code).  
      27  

(2)  Adjustments to Comply with Section 401(m) of the Code . The Administrator shall
cause to be made such periodic computations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether either of the tests set forth in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied during a Plan Year, and, if it appears
to the Administrator that neither of such tests will be satisfied, the Administrator shall take such steps as it deems necessary or appropriate to adjust the Employer Matching Contributions made, After-Tax Contributions made, and any Before-Tax
Contributions treated as Employer Matching Contributions pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this Section 4.4 for all or a portion of such Plan Year on behalf of Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees to the extent necessary in
order for one of such tests to be satisfied. If after the end of a Plan Year it is determined that regardless of any steps taken neither of the tests set forth in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied with respect to
such Plan Year, the Administrator shall calculate the total amount by which any such contributions on behalf of Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees must be reduced in order to satisfy either such test, in the manner prescribed
by section 401(m)(6) of the Code (the  excess aggregate contributions amount ). The amount to be reduced with respect to Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees shall be determined by first reducing the After-Tax
Contributions (including Before-Tax Contributions recharacterized as After-Tax Contributions pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this Section 4.4) and then by reducing the Employer Matching Contributions for each Participant whose actual dollar
amount of such aggregate contributions for such Plan Year is highest until such reduced dollar amount equals the next highest dollar amount of such contributions for such Plan Year on behalf of any other highly compensated eligible employee, or
until the total reduction equals the excess aggregate contributions amount. If further reductions are necessary, such contributions on behalf of each Participant who is a highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of such
contributions is the highest (after the reduction described in the preceding sentence) shall be reduced in accordance with the preceding  
      28  

sentence. Such reductions shall continue to be made to the extent necessary until the total reduction equals the excess aggregate contributions amount. If After-Tax Contributions are distributed
pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2), any corresponding Employer Matching Contributions related thereto plus any income and minus any loss allocable through the end of the Plan Year for which the Employer Matching Contributions were made to which such
Participant would be entitled under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) if such Participant had terminated employment on the last day of the Plan Year for which contributions were made (or earlier if any such
Participant actually terminated employment at any earlier date) shall also be distributed with such After-Tax Contributions (and taken into account to determine whether further reductions are necessary), and any remaining amount of such
corresponding Employer Matching Contributions plus any income and minus any loss allocable through the end of the Plan Year for which the Employer Matching Contributions were made shall be forfeited. If the reductions required by this subparagraph
exceed the amount of After-Tax Contributions made or to be made by any Participant for such Plan Year and the amount of Employer Matching Contributions made or to be made on behalf of such Participant for such Plan Year, any Before-Tax Contributions
made on behalf of such Participant that the Administrator has elected to treat as Employer Matching Contributions pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall also be adjusted and taken into account in accordance with this
subparagraph, except that such Before-Tax Contributions may not be recharacterized as After-Tax Contributions.  
      29  

Section 4.5 .  Limitation on Employer Contributions .  
 The contributions of an Employer for any Plan Year shall not exceed the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for
federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year of such Employer that coincides with such Plan Year.    Any contribution made by an Employer
by reason of a good faith mistake of fact, or the portion of any contribution made by an Employer that exceeds the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes by reason of a good faith mistake
in determining the maximum allowable deduction, shall upon the request of such Employer be returned by the Trustee to the Employer. An Employer s request and the return of any such contribution must be made within one year after such
contribution was mistakenly made or after the deduction of such excess portion of such contribution was disallowed, as the case may be. The amount to be returned to an Employer pursuant to this paragraph shall be the excess of (i) the amount
contributed over (ii) the amount that would have been contributed had there not been a mistake of fact or a mistake in determining the maximum allowable deduction. Earnings attributable to the mistaken contribution shall not be returned to the
Employer, but losses attributable thereto shall reduce the amount to be so returned. If the return to the Employer of the amount attributable to the mistaken contribution would cause the balance of any Participant s account as of the date such
amount is to be returned (determined as if such date coincided with the close of a Plan Year) to be reduced to less than what would have been the balance of such account as of such date had the mistaken amount not been contributed, the amount to be
returned to the Employer shall be limited so as to avoid such reduction.    Any Before-Tax Contributions returned to an Employer pursuant to
this Section 4.5 shall be treated as the return of Untaxed Contributions, up to the extent Untaxed Contributions were made by such Participant to the Plan for such Plan Year and, to the extent that the returned contributions exceed such Untaxed
Contributions, such returned contributions shall be treated as Designated Roth Contributions made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year.  
      30  

ARTICLE 5   
 EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS  
  Section 5.1 .  After-Tax Contributions .  
 Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.4 (relating to limitations on contributions for highly-compensated Eligible Employees)
and Section 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code), each Participant who is an Eligible Employee may elect in accordance with Section 3.2(a) to make After-Tax Contributions under the Plan by payroll
deduction. After-Tax Contributions made by a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 for any payroll period shall equal a whole percentage not less than 1 nor more than 10 percent of the Participant s
Compensation for such payroll period, as designated by the Participant in his or her request pursuant to Section 3.2(a). After-Tax Contributions made by any other Participant for any payroll period shall equal a whole percentage not less than 1
nor more than 20 percent and, effective as of January 1, 2006, 50 percent, of the Participant s Compensation for such payroll period, as designated by the Participant in his or her request pursuant to Section 3.2(a). Except as set
forth below, After-Tax Contributions shall be delivered to the Trustee no less frequently than bi-weekly. In addition, if back-pay is awarded to a Participant who is an Eligible Employee and any portion of such back-pay constitutes Compensation as
defined in subsection (13) of Article 2 (relating to the definition of compensation), After-Tax Contributions shall be made for such Participant in an amount equal to the After-Tax Contribution percentage, which was most recently chosen by the
Participant in his or her request pursuant to Section 3.2(a), of such back-pay that constitutes Compensation. An  
      31  

After-Tax Contribution described in the preceding sentence shall be treated under the Plan in the same manner as all other After-Tax Contributions and shall be delivered to the Trustee as soon as
practicable after the back-pay is paid to the Participant. Except as provided in the following sentence and in Section 4.1, After-Tax Contributions shall be subject to the same provisions regarding commencement, change and suspension applicable
to Before-Tax Contributions as set forth in Section 4.1. If a Participant who has not attained age 59  1   2  makes a withdrawal of After-Tax Contributions
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), then: (a) After-Tax Contributions made by such Participant pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall cease beginning with the first payroll period beginning after the date on which the Participant receives such
withdrawal and (b) such Participant shall not again be eligible to elect such contributions until the first payroll period that coincides with or follows the date on which contributions ceased by 6 months.  
  Section 5.2 .  Rollover Contributions .  
 (a) The Trustee shall be authorized to receive, hold and distribute in accordance with the Plan, a direct rollover contribution consisting of
cash, transferred to the Plan by (i) a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, including after-tax employee contributions to such plan, (ii) an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, excluding
after-tax employee contributions or (iii) an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The
Trustee shall also be authorized to receive, hold and distribute in accordance with the Plan, a Participant contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from (A) a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code,
(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, (C) an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
political subdivision of a state or (D) an individual retirement account or annuity  
      32  

described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income. The amounts transferred must be eligible rollover
distributions, as defined in section 402(c) of the Code. Effective December 1, 2012, an eligible rollover distribution of a lump sum amount from a qualified defined benefit plan sponsored by the Company also may be contributed to this Plan in
accordance with administrative rules established by the Administrator. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a rollover contribution shall not include  designated Roth contributions  described in section 402A of the
Code or any related earnings with respect to such contributions.    (b)  Delivery of Rollover Contributions to Administrator . Except
as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.2, if an individual desires to make a rollover contribution pursuant to such paragraph (a), such contribution either (i) shall be delivered by the individual to the
Administrator and by the Administrator to the Trustee on or before the 60th day after the day on which the Employee receives the distribution or on or before such later date as may be prescribed by law, or (ii) shall be transferred on behalf of
the individual directly from the trust from which the eligible rollover distribution is made. Any contribution that is delivered by the Eligible Employee must be accompanied by (i) a statement of the Employee that to the best of his or her
knowledge the amount so transferred meets the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.2, (ii) a copy of such documents as may have been received by the Employee advising him or her of the amount of and the character of
such distribution and (iii) any investment election with respect to such contribution in such form and manner as may be required by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall not accept a rollover contribution if
in its judgment accepting such contribution would cause the Plan to violate any provision of the Code or Regulations, and the Administrator shall not be required to accept such a contribution to the extent it consists of property other than cash.
 
      33  

Section 5.3 .  Special Accounting Rules for Rollover Contributions .  
 If a rollover contribution is made by or on behalf of an Employee, the Administrator shall cause a Rollover Account to be established and
maintained for such Employee to which shall be credited all rollover contributions made pursuant to Section 5.2. A rollover contribution shall be credited to such Rollover Account as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or next following the
date on which such contribution is delivered to the Trustee.    If a rollover contribution is made by, or a direct transfer is made on
behalf of, an Eligible Employee prior to becoming a Participant, such Eligible Employee shall until such time as he or she becomes a Participant be deemed to be a Participant, and his or her Rollover Account and After-Tax Contributions Account, if
any, shall be deemed to be an account of a Participant, for all purposes of the Plan except for the purposes of the allocation of contributions provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 7.3 and any determination
of when he or she becomes a Participant pursuant to Article 3.     ARTICLE 6   
 TRUST AND INVESTMENT FUNDS  
  Section 6.1 .  Trust .  
 A Trust shall be created by the execution of a trust agreement between the Company and the Trustee. All contributions under the Plan shall be
paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall hold all monies and other property received by it and invest and reinvest the same, together with the income therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the provisions of the trust
agreement. The Trustee shall make distributions from the Trust Fund at such time or times to such person or persons and in such amounts as the Administrator directs in accordance with the Plan.  
      34  

Section 6.2 .  Investment Funds .  
 The Trustee shall establish and maintain, or shall cause to be established and maintained, an investment fund herein called the  Employer
Stock Fund  which shall be invested in Common Stock, and shall also include such  short-term  obligations and short-term liquid investments purchased by the Trustee, in accordance with the Trust Agreement,
pending the selection and purchase of the Common Stock or as otherwise determined by the Trustee to be necessary to satisfy such fund s cash needs. In addition, as directed by the Investment Office, one or more additional separate investment
funds shall be established and maintained and shall be invested as directed by the Investment Office. The Investment Office also may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, segregate any of the assets held under any investment fund
established pursuant to this Section 6.2 and allocate the investment results from such segregated assets among all or a portion of the accounts of Participants in such manner as it shall determine to be appropriate. All charges and expenses
incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of investments for a fund shall be charged to such fund except to the extent such charges and expenses are paid by the Employers or from other revenue available to the Plan.  
  ARTICLE 7   
   PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENT ELECTIONS  
  Section 7.1 .  Participant Accounts and Investment Elections .  
 (a)  Participant Accounts . For each Participant the Administrator shall establish and maintain, or shall cause to be established and
maintained, investment accounts to which amounts contributed under the Plan shall be credited according to each Participant s investment elections pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7.1, subject to the penultimate sentence of
the first paragraph of Section 6.2 (relating to the Investment Office s authority to segregate any of the assets held under any investment fund).  
      35  

Each such investment account shall, to the extent appropriate, be composed of the following
accounts: (A) a Before-Tax Contributions Account, which shall be divided into an Untaxed Contribution Account and a Designated Roth Contributions Account, (B) a Catch-Up Contributions Account, (C) an Employer Matching Contributions
Account, (D) an After-Tax Contributions Account, and (E) a Rollover Account. Earnings and losses on investment of funds in each account shall be credited or debited to that account.  
 All such accounts and subaccounts shall be for accounting purposes only, and there shall be no segregation of assets within the investment
funds among the separate Participants  accounts.    (b)  Investment Election . Each Participant, as part of his or her request for
participation described in Section 3.2 (or in connection with the delivery of a rollover contribution pursuant to Section 5.2), shall make an investment election that shall apply to the investment of contributions to be made on his or her
behalf or by him or her pursuant to Article 4 (relating to Employer contributions) or Article 5 (relating to Employee contributions) and any earnings on such contributions. Such election shall specify that such contributions be invested
either (i) wholly in one of the funds maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1 or (ii) divided among such funds in 1 percent increments or in such other increments established by the
Administrator or the Investment Office from time to time. Each Eligible Employee for whom a Rollover Account is established before such Eligible Employee has become a Participant shall, in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, make such
investment election as of the Valuation Date on which such account is established. During any period in which no direction as to the investment of an Employee s account is on file with the Administrator, contributions or direct transfers made
by him or her, or on his or her behalf, to the Plan will be invested in such manner as the Investment Office shall determine.  
      36  

(c)  Change of Investment Election . Subject to such restrictions as may be
imposed by the Administrator or the Investment Office (including, without limitation, any restrictions imposed with respect to transfers of funds to or from the Employer Stock Fund described in Section 6.2 by individuals who are subject to
Rule16b-3 under section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), a Participant may elect to change as of any Valuation Date his or her investment election applicable to all or any portion of his or her current account balance. In addition, a
Participant may elect to change as of the first day of any payroll period his or her investment election applicable to future contributions made pursuant to Articles 4 (relating to Employer contributions) or 5 (relating to Employee contributions),
or both, as specified by the Participant. Such changes shall be limited to the investment funds then maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1. A Participant s change of investment election
must be made in the manner and at the time prescribed by the Administrator (or its delegate). Any such change shall specify that such contributions be invested either (i) wholly in one of the funds maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1, or (ii) divided among such funds in 1 percent increments or such other increments established by the Administrator or the Investment Office from time to time.  
  Section 7.2 .  Allocation of Net Income of Trust Fund and Fluctuation in Value of Trust Fund Assets .  
 In the event that contributions, income and losses are not otherwise specifically allocated to Participant accounts by the Trustee, as soon as
practical after each Valuation Date, the net worth of each investment fund (as defined in Section 6.2) as of such Valuation Date shall be determined. If the net worth of such investment fund as so determined is more or less than the total of
all  
      37  

balances credited as of such Valuation Date to the subaccounts of Participants invested in the investment fund as of such Valuation Date who are Participants as of such Valuation Date, the amount
of any excess or deficiency shall be prorated and credited or charged to such subaccounts proportionally to the balances of such subaccounts as of the preceding Valuation Date after making all allocations for such preceding Valuation Date prescribed
by this Article and after decreasing each such subaccount by any loans, withdrawals or distributions from such subaccount during such period (but not less than zero), with all of such decreases to be made in such manner as the Administrator
determines in its discretion to be necessary.    Notwithstanding any provision of this Article 7, any Designated Roth Contributions Account
shall be maintained in a manner that satisfies the separate accounting requirement, and any Regulations or other requirements promulgated, under section 402A of the Code. Accordingly, gains, losses and other credits and charges shall be separately
allocated on a reasonable basis to each such account and other accounts under the Plan, the Plan shall keep a record of each Participant s Designated Roth Contributions that have not been withdrawn, and contributions and withdrawals of
Designated Roth Contributions, and related earnings, shall be accounted for with respect to Designated Roth Contributions Accounts. However, forfeitures shall not be allocated to any Designated Roth Contributions Account. These separate accounting
requirements apply with respect to a Participant from the time the Participant makes his or her first Designated Roth Contribution until the time the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account is distributed.  
      38  

Section 7.3 .  Allocations of Contributions Among Participants  Accounts .
   (a)  Allocation of Before-Tax Contributions . Before-Tax Contributions shall be allocated to the Before-Tax Contributions Account of
each Participant for whom such contributions are made as soon as practical after such contributions are delivered to the Trustee or insurer maintaining a group annuity contract. The Before-Tax Contributions that consist of (i) Before-Tax
Contributions made on behalf of the Participant pursuant to Section 4.1 for Plan Years beginning prior to (A) in the case of a Participant who is not a Local 15 Member, January 1, 2006, and (B) in the case of a Participant who is
a Local 15 Member, January 1, 2009, (ii) any Before-Tax Contributions transferred to the Plan from the PECO Energy Company Employee Savings Plan on behalf of such Participant, and (iii) any Before-Tax Contributions that are Untaxed
Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.2 for Plan Years beginning on or after (A) in the case of a Participant who is not a Local 15 Member, January 1, 2006, and (B) in the case of a Participant who is a Local 15 Member,
January 1, 2009, shall be allocated to the Untaxed Contributions Account of such Participant. The Before-Tax Contributions that consist of Designated Roth Contributions made on behalf of the Participant pursuant to paragraph
(c) Section 4.2 (relating to Untaxed Contributions and Designated Roth Contributions) for Plan Years beginning on or after (A) in the case of a Participant who is not a Local 15 Member, January 1, 2006, and (B) in the case
of a Participant who is a Local 15 Member, January 1, 2009, January 1, 2006 shall be allocated to the Designated Roth Contributions Account of such Participant.  
 (b)  Allocation of Catch-Up Contributions . Catch-Up Contributions shall be allocated to the Catch-Up Contributions Account of each
Participant for whom such contributions are made as soon as practical after such contributions are delivered to the Trustee or insurer maintaining a group annuity contract.  
 (c)  Allocation of Employer Matching Contributions . Employer Matching Contributions shall be allocated to the Employer Matching
Contributions Account of each Participant for whom such contributions are made as soon as practical after such contributions are delivered to the Trustee or insurer maintaining a group annuity contract.  
      39  

(d)  Allocation of After-Tax Contributions . After-Tax Contributions shall be allocated to
the After-Tax Contributions Account of the Participant who makes such contributions as soon as practical after such contributions are delivered to the Trustee or insurer maintaining a group annuity contract.  
 (e)  Allocation of Rollover Contributions and Direct Transfers . Rollover contributions made pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Employee
contributions) shall be credited to the Rollover Account of the Participant on whose behalf such contribution is made as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or next following the date on which the contribution is delivered to the Trustee.  
 (f)  Allocation of Forfeitures . The total amount forfeited during any Plan Year shall be used to (i) pay the expenses incurred by
the Trustee for the administration of the Trust Fund not paid by the Company, (ii) held to pay the expenses reasonably estimated by the Trustee for the administration of the Trust Fund during the next following Plan Year but not expected to be
paid by the Company, or (iii) used to reduce Employer Matching Contributions as determined by the Administrator.  
  Section 7.4 .  Limitations on Allocations Imposed by Section 415 of the Code .  
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the amount allocated to a Participant s accounts under the Plan for each Plan Year shall
be limited so that the aggregate annual additions to the Participant s accounts under this Plan and in all other defined contribution plans maintained by an Employer shall not exceed the lesser of: (A) $46,000 (as adjusted pursuant to
section 415(d) of the Code) and (B) 100% of the Participant s compensation for such Plan Year.    If the amount to be allocated to
a Participant s accounts pursuant to Section 7.3 (relating to allocations of contributions among Participant s accounts) for a Plan Year would exceed the limitation set forth in this Section 7.4, then such excess shall be reduced
before allocations are made to the Participant s accounts. If, in any Plan Year, the annual additions actually allocated to the Participant s accounts exceed the limitation set forth in this Section 7.4, then such annual additions
shall be corrected in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System of the Internal Revenue Service.  
      40  

For purposes of this Section 7.4, the  annual additions  for a Plan Year to a
Participant s accounts in this Plan and in any other defined contribution plan maintained by an Employer is the sum during such Plan Year of:  
 (a) the amount of Employer contributions (including Before-Tax Contributions and Designated Roth Contributions and excluding
any Default Before-Tax Contributions that are withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 3.2) allocated to the Participant s accounts, excluding, however, (X) Before-Tax Contributions and Designated Roth Contributions that are
 catch-up contributions  made pursuant to section 414(v) of the Code, (Y) excess deferrals that are distributed in accordance with section 402(g) of the Code and (Z) restorative payments (within the meaning of section
1.415(c)-1(b)(2)(ii)(C) of the Regulations),    (b) the amount of forfeitures allocated to the Participant s accounts,
   (c) the amount of Employee contributions allocated to the Participant accounts, but excluding any rollover contributions,
direct transfers or loan repayments, and    (d) the contributions allocated on behalf of the Participant to any individual
medical benefit account (as defined in section 415(l) of the Code) or, if the Participant is a key employee within the meaning of section 419A(d)(3) of the Code, to any post-retirement medical benefits account established pursuant to section
419A(d)(1) of the Code.    For purposes of this Section 7.4,  defined contribution plan  shall have the meaning set forth in
section 415 of the Code and Regulations, and the term  Employer  shall include all Affiliates except that in defining Affiliates  more than 50 percent  shall be substituted for  at least 80 percent  where required by
section 415(g) of the Code. In addition, for purposes of this Section 7.4,  compensation  shall mean a Participant s compensation as defined under section 415(c)(3) of the Code (as amended from time to time).  
      41  

Section 7.5 .  Correction of Error .  
 If it comes to the attention of the Administrator that an error has been made in any of the allocations prescribed by this Article or an error
has been made in any other respect, appropriate adjustment shall be made to the accounts of all Participants and designated Beneficiaries that are affected by such error, except that no adjustment need be made with respect to any Participant or
Beneficiary whose account has been distributed in full prior to the discovery of such error.     ARTICLE 8   
   WITHDRAWALS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  
  Section 8.1 .  Withdrawals and Distributions Prior to Termination of Employment .  
 (a)  Hardship Withdrawals . An Employee who has not attained age 59  1   2  may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw as of any date all or a portion of the balance of his or her Before-Tax Contributions Account
(other than earnings credited to such account after December 31, 1988), Catch-Up Contributions Account and Employer Matching Contributions Account only if the Participant has incurred a financial hardship, except that while any loan to the
Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal under this paragraph (a) shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant. The determination of the
existence of financial hardship and the amount required to be distributed to satisfy the need created by the hardship will be made by the Administrator in a uniform and  non-discriminatory  manner subject to the
following rules:    (A) A financial hardship shall be deemed to exist if, and only if, the Participant certifies to the
Committee that the financial need is on account of:      

(i) 
 medical expenses described in section 213(d) of the Code incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the Participant, the Participant s Spouse or any dependents of the Participant (as defined in section 152 of the
Code) or primary beneficiary;    
      42  

(ii) 
 funeral or burial expenses incurred by the Participant for the Participant s deceased parent, Spouse, children or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Code, without regard to section 152(d)(1)(B) of the
Code) or primary beneficiary;        

(iii) 
 the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence of the Participant;        

(iv) 
 the payment of tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses for up to the next twelve months of  post-secondary  education for the Participant, the
Participant s Spouse, children or dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code, without regard to sections 152(b)(1) and (2) and 152(d)(1)(B) of the Code) or primary beneficiary;    

(v) 
 the need to prevent eviction of the Participant from his or her principal residence or foreclosure of mortgage of the Participant s principal residence; or    

(vi) 
 expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant s principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under section 165 of the Code (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of
adjusted gross income).      For purposes of the foregoing, an individual is a Participant s  primary
beneficiary  if the Participant has designated him or her as a  Beneficiary  under Section 8.5 and such individual has an unconditional right to all or a portion of the Participant s accounts upon the Participant s
death.    (B) A distribution shall be deemed to be necessary to satisfy a financial need of the Participant if, and only if,
the Participant:      

(i) 
 has obtained all distributions, other than hardship withdrawals, and all nontaxable loans under any Employer s plan in which the Participant participates, and    

(ii) 
 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the distribution is not in excess of the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need, which need shall include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state
and local income taxes, excise taxes and penalties.    
      43  

If a Participant receives a hardship withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (a), then, in addition
to the cessation of Before-Tax Contributions and After-Tax Contributions required by paragraph (a) of Section 4.1 (relating to initial election regarding regular payroll Before-Tax Contributions), contributions by the Participant to
qualified or nonqualified plans of deferred compensation, including a stock option, stock purchase or similar plan, maintained by an Employer also shall (except where excused by regulation) cease beginning with the first payroll period beginning
after the date on which the Participant receives such hardship withdrawal and continuing until the first payroll period that coincides with or follows the date on which contributions ceased by six months.  
 The Participant shall designate the extent to which the hardship withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (a) are Designated Roth
Contributions from the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event that any such designation is not made
or is incomplete, such hardship withdrawals shall be treated as withdrawals of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that the hardship withdrawal exceeds such Designated
Roth Contributions, such hardship withdrawal shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions.    (b)  Withdrawals After Age 59  1   2  . An Employee who has attained age 59  1   2  may make a request by
calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw as of any date an amount which is not greater than the balance of his or her Before-Tax Contributions Account, Catch-Up Contributions Account and
Employer Matching Contributions Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the
balance in such accounts less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.  
      44  

The Participant shall designate the extent to which the withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph
(b) are Designated Roth Contributions from the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant s Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event
that any such designation is not made or is incomplete, such withdrawals shall be treated as withdrawals of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that the withdrawal
exceeds such Designated Roth Contributions, such withdrawal shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions.    (c)  Withdrawals From the
After-Tax Contributions Account . An Employee may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, no more than once during any Plan Year, to withdraw from his or her After-Tax Contributions
Account an amount which is not greater than the balance of the Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the Participant under
Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.  
 (d)  Withdrawals from the Rollover Account . A Participant may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be
prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw an amount which is not greater than the balance in his or her Rollover Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the Participant under
Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.  
      45  

(e)  Qualified Reservist Withdrawals . A Participant who is a Qualified Reservist may make a
request by calling VRU, or in such manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw any portion of his or her Before-Tax Contributions Account or his or her Designated Roth Contributions Account, and the amount requested shall not be
subject to the 10 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to section 72(t)(2)(G) of the Code, provided that the amount requested is distributed during the period beginning on the date the Participant is ordered or called to active duty and ending at
the close of his or her active duty.    (f)  Withdrawals of Employer Matching Contributions for Members of IBEW Local Union 614 .
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, effective April 16, 2010, a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 614 and who has completed 60 months as a Participant may elect, in
accordance with procedures established by the Administrator, to receive a distribution of all or any part of his or her Employer Matching Contributions Account, as adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto determined as of the
Valuation Date next succeeding the date of receipt of the request for distribution.    Additionally, effective April 16, 2010, a
Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 614, regardless of whether he or she has completed 60 months as a Participant, may elect, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator, to receive a
distribution of all or any part of that portion of the Employer Matching Contributions Account that is derived from Employer Matching Contributions in excess of Employer Matching Contributions allocated to his or her Employer Matching Contributions
Account during the two Plan Years preceding the Plan Year in which the withdrawal takes place, adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto determined as of the Valuation Date next succeeding the date of receipt of the request for
distribution.  
      46  

No distribution made pursuant to this paragraph (f) may be for an amount which is less than
the lesser of (i) $200; and (ii) the balance of the Participant s Employer Matching Contributions Account, as adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto. In addition, a Participant may not make more than one
withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (f) in any Plan Year.    (g)  Provisions Applicable to All Withdrawals . Any withdrawal made
pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall be made at such time as prescribed by the Administrator and shall be made pro-rata from each of the investment funds in which as of the date of the withdrawal (i) in the case of a withdrawal pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8.1, the Participant s Before-Tax Contributions Account, Catch-Up Contributions Account (and, if applicable, Employer Matching Contributions Account) is invested, (ii) in the case of a

(v) the case of a withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section 8.1, the Participant s Employer Matching Contribution Account. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Administrator or the Investment
Office may impose any restrictions it deems necessary or appropriate with respect to withdrawals by individuals who have any portion of their accounts invested in the Employer Stock Fund described in Section 6.2 and who are subject to Rule
16b-3 under section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
      47  

(h)  Dividend Distributions in Respect of the Employer Stock Fund . Dividends shall be
allocated to the accounts of each Participant, any portion of whose account balance is invested in the Employer Stock Fund in accordance with paragraph (b) of Section 7.1, based upon the total number of shares of Common Stock represented
by the Participant s proportionate share of the Employer Stock Fund as of such date as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator on or before each dividend record date. Cash dividends shall be reinvested in Common Stock (through
the Employer Stock Fund) unless the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) elects, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to receive a cash distribution in an amount equal to such dividend, payable not later than 90 days
after the end of the Plan Year in which such dividend was paid.     Section 8.2 .  Loans to Participants .  
 (a)  Making of Loans . Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.2, the Administrator shall establish a loan program
whereby any Participant who is a party-in-interest (within the meaning of section 3(14) of ERISA) or any Beneficiary who is a party-in-interest and any such Participant s Beneficiary may request, in the manner and form prescribed by the
Administrator, to borrow funds from the Plan. The principal amount of such loan shall be not less than $1,000 and the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans to a Participant or Beneficiary shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) 50% of the value
of the aggregate of the Participant s vested account balances as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately preceding the day on which the loan is made; and (2) $50,000, reduced by the excess, if any, of the highest outstanding
loan balances of the Participant under all plans maintained by the Employer during the period of time beginning one year and one day prior to the date such loan is to be made and ending on the date such loan is to be made over the outstanding
balance of loans from all such plans on the date on which such loan was made.  
      48  

(b)  Restrictions . Any loan approved by the Administrator pursuant to the preceding
paragraph (a) shall be made only upon the following terms and conditions:    (1) The period for repayment of the loan
shall be arrived at by mutual agreement between the Administrator and the Participant but such period shall not exceed five years or, in the case of a loan to acquire a principal place of residence, shall not be less than five years or more than 15
years, from the date of the loan. Such loan may be prepaid at any time, without penalty, by delivery to the Administrator of a check in an amount equal to the entire unpaid balance of such loan. No partial prepayment shall be permitted. Except as
otherwise provided under uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Administrator, any loan to a Participant who is an Employee is due in full immediately after termination of employment.  
 (2) No loan shall be made to a Participant who is an Employee unless such Participant consents to have such loan repaid in
substantially equal installments deducted from the regular payments of the Participant s compensation during the term of the loan. A Participant who (a) was an Employee at the time the Participant received a loan from the Plan, (b) is
no longer an Employee and no longer receives compensation from an Employer, but (c) continues to perform services for an Employer, shall consent, either at the time the loan is taken or prior to the date prescribed by the Administrator, to have
the balance of any loan outstanding at the time the Participant no longer is an Employee repaid in substantially equal installments over the remaining life of the loan. Such installments shall be paid in the manner specified by the Administrator.
   (3) Each loan shall be evidenced by the Participant s collateral promissory note, in the form prescribed by the
Administrator, for the amount of the loan, with interest, payable to the order of the Plan, and shall be secured by an assignment of 50% of the Participant s vested account balance.  
 (4) Each loan shall bear a fixed interest rate commensurate with the interest rates then being charged by persons in the
business of lending money for loans made under similar circumstances, as determined by the Administrator.    (5) Except as
otherwise provided in this Plan, no withdrawal (other than a withdrawal from a Participant s accounts to the extent that such withdrawal would not reduce the Participant s vested account balances to less than the then outstanding balance
of any loan to such Participant or such higher amount determined by the Administrator to be appropriate security for such loan) or distribution shall be made to any Participant who has borrowed from the Trust, or to a Beneficiary of any such
Participant, unless and until the loan, including interest, has been repaid.    (6) A charge shall be made against the
account of each Participant requesting a loan equal to such reasonable loan application fee (and loan acceptance fee, if required by the Administrator) as shall be set from time to time by the Administrator.  
 (7) A Participant is permitted only one loan in any calendar year, provided, however, that no more than five loans to a
Participant may be outstanding at any time, except that for a Participant described in the following sentence, no more than three loans may be outstanding at any time (for the period beginning April 1, 2009 and ending August 31, 2010, only
one of such outstanding loans may be for the purpose of acquiring a principal place of residence and only two of such outstanding loans may be for other  
      49  

purposes). A Participant described in the preceding sentence is any of the following: (A) a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, (B) a
Participant who is employed at Byron in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Security System Union Local 1, (C) a Participant who is employed at Oyster Creek in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Government Security Officers of
America Local 17, (D) a Participant who is employed at Three Mile Island in Nuclear Security in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Government Security Officers of America Local 18, and (E) a Participant who is classified by an
Employer as a management employee.    (8) Loan repayments shall be invested in the various investment funds as elected by the
Participant.    (9) The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, restrict the amount to be disbursed pursuant to any loan
request to the extent it deems necessary to take into account any fluctuations in the value of a Participant s accounts since the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date on which such loan is to be made.  
 (10) Any restrictions the Administrator or the Investment Office determines are necessary or appropriate with respect to loans
requested by individuals who have any portion of their accounts invested in the Employer Stock Fund described in Section 6.2 and who are subject to Rule 16b-3 under section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
 If any loan or portion of a loan made to a Participant under the Plan, together with the accrued interest thereon, is in default (taking into
account any grace period permitted by law, and as determined by the Administrator), the Administrator shall take appropriate steps to collect on the note and foreclose on the security. If upon a Participant s termination of employment entitling
the Participant to a distribution under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment), death or retirement, any loan or portion of a loan made to such Participant under the Plan, together with the accrued interest
thereon, remains unpaid, such unpaid amount may be repaid to the Plan no later than the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which such termination of employment occurred or as of such later date or dates permitted
under uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Administrator. If full repayment is not so made, an amount equal to the unpaid portion of such loan, together with the accrued interest thereon, shall be charged to the
Participant s accounts after all other adjustments required under the Plan, but before any distribution pursuant to Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment).  
      50  

(c)  Loan Subaccount . The Trustee shall establish and maintain a loan subaccount on behalf
of each Participant or Beneficiary to whom a loan is made under this Section 8.2. Such subaccount shall represent the investment of the Participant s or Beneficiary s account in such loan. As of the Valuation Date immediately
preceding the date on which a loan is approved, the Participant s or Beneficiary s loan subaccount shall be credited with the amount of the loan and thereafter shall be debited with repayments of the principal of such loan. The various
accounts maintained for the Participant or Beneficiary shall be invested in the loan subaccount and debited by the amount of the loan and credited with payments of interest on, and repayments of principal of, such loan in accordance with uniform
rules established by the Administrator.    (d)  Sarbanes-Oxley . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
Administrator reserves the right to deny the request of a Participant for a loan that, in the judgment of the Administrator, would violate any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  
  Section 8.3 .  Distributions Upon Termination of Employment .  
 (a)  Termination of Employment under Circumstances Entitling Participant to Full Distribution of His or Her Account Balance . If a
Participant terminates employment, the Participant, or his or her designated Beneficiary, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive the entire balance of the Participant s accounts, at the time set forth in Section 8.4 (relating to
time of distribution) and in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section 8.3.  
      51  

(b)  Form of Distribution . (1) Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section 8.3
(relating to small benefits payable in lump sum), any distribution to which a Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, becomes entitled upon termination of employment shall be distributed by whichever of the following forms of distribution
the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, elects by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator:      

(A) 
 By payment in a lump sum.        

(B) 
 By payment in a series of approximately equal annual, quarterly, or monthly installments, over a period of up to 15 years; provided that installments shall not be available with respect to amounts invested in the CNA
1997 guaranteed investment contract.      A Participant who elected to receive distribution of his or her vested account balance
in the form of installments may, at any time after such election is made, elect to receive the remaining amount of his or her vested account balance in the form of a lump sum payment. If no election is made by a Participant or Beneficiary, as the
case may be, as to the form of distribution, the Participant s vested account balance shall be distributed in the form of a lump sum payment.  
 The amount distributed hereunder shall be paid in cash, except that if the Participant s account is paid in a lump sum, then the
Participant may request that all of his or her account invested in the Employer Stock Fund be distributed in whole shares of Common Stock held in such Fund with any fractional share being paid in cash. The number of shares of Common Stock to be
distributed shall be based on the current fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Trustee under Section 7.2 (relating to allocation of net income of Trust Fund and fluctuation in value of Trust assets) as of the
Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately preceding the date payment of the Participant s account is to be made. Requests for distribution in the form of Common Stock shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Administrator shall
determine under rules and regulations which are uniformly applied.    Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, no distribution shall be
made in the form of installments with respect to a Participant s Rollover Account that was established to hold the amount distributed or directly transferred from the Commonwealth Edison Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan upon such
plan s termination if the Participant elected not to receive distribution of such amount until his or her 65th birthday.  
      52  

(c)  Notice of Availability of Election of Optional Forms of Benefits . No less than 30 days
(or such shorter period as permitted by law) and no more than 90 days before distribution is to be made hereunder, the Administrator, or its designee, shall explain to the Participant that he or she may elect either form of distribution set forth in
paragraph (b) of this Section 8.3. Such explanation shall include a general description of the eligibility conditions and other material features of the optional forms of distribution provided under the Plan. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this paragraph (c), distribution may commence less than 30 days after the description described above is given, provided that: (i) the Administrator, or its designee, clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right
to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the explanation to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and (ii) the Participant, after receiving the
explanation, affirmatively elects a distribution. The description referred to in this paragraph (c), as well as the explanation of the participant s right to a period of at least 30 days to consider such explanation before electing a
distribution, shall be provided to the Participant through the VRU or in such other manner prescribed by the Administrator.    (d)  Small
Benefits Payable in Lump Sum . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the vested amount of the Participant s account balances does not exceed $5,000, not including the value of the Participant s Rollover Account
or, for distributions occurring on or after March 28, 2005, $1,000, including the value of the Participant s Rollover Account (such amount referred to herein as the  small benefit amount ), such vested amount shall be distributed
in a lump sum cash payment as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant s termination of employment in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Administrator.  
      53  

(e)  Direct Rollover Option . In the case of a distribution from the Plan (excluding any
amount offset against the Participant s account balance to repay the outstanding balance of any unpaid loan) which is an  eligible rollover distribution  within the meaning of section 402(c)(4) of the Code, a Participant (or surviving
Spouse of a Participant or a former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) of the Code) may elect that all or any portion of such distribution shall be directly transferred as a
rollover contribution from this Plan to (i) an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an annuity plan described in
section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, (v) a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code (the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover contributions),
(vi) an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code (the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover contributions) or (vii) effective
January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code. However, in the case of a distribution of a Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account prior to January 1, 2007, such distribution shall only be directly
transferred as a rollover contribution from this Plan to an account or annuity described in section 408 of the Code, or to such a retirement or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that is a defined contribution plan that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. In the case of a
distribution of a Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account on or after January 1, 2007, such distribution shall only be directly transferred as a rollover  
      54  

contribution to an account or annuity described in section 408 of the Code, or to such a qualified retirement or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to
separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. Notwithstanding any provision of this
paragraph (e), in the case of any eligible rollover distribution that includes all or any portion of the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account, a Participant or surviving Spouse or a former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a
qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) of the Code may elect to transfer such portion only to another plan which accounts for Designated Roth Contributions described in section 402A of the Code or to a Roth IRA described in
section 408A of the Code and only to the extent the rollover is permitted by the rules of section 402(c) of the Code. In addition, in the case of a distribution described in the preceding sentence that occurs on or after January 1, 2008, a
Beneficiary who is not the surviving Spouse of the Participant may elect that all or any portion of such distribution shall be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from this Plan to (i) an individual retirement account described in
section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code or (iii) effective January 1, 2010, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code, that, in either case, is established for
the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of the Beneficiary.     Section 8.4 .  Time of Distribution .  
 A Participant who has terminated employment shall commence receiving distribution of his or her vested account balance as soon as
administratively practical after the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately following the date on which the Participant attains age 65, except as provided below.  
      55  

(1) 
  Early Distribution . Except as provided in subparagraph (7), a Participant whose Termination Date is prior to his or her 65th birthday may elect by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by

or 70  1   2  may elect at any time by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to have distribution of his or her
vested account balance made within 60 days after the date such election is made.        

(4) 
  Required Beginning Date . Distributions paid or commencing during the Participant s lifetime shall commence not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
Participant attains age 70  1   2 , except that distributions made to a Participant who is not a  five percent owner  (as defined in section 416(i) of
the Code) may commence on April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70  1   2  or the
calendar year in which the Participant retires. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, any distributions required by this subparagraph shall be made not less rapidly than in accordance with the final Regulations under
Section 401(a)(9). The Participant shall designate the extent to which the distribution of Before-Tax Contributions pursuant to this subparagraph 4 are Designated Roth Contributions from the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions
Account and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant s Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event that any such designation is not made or is incomplete, such distribution shall be treated as a
distribution of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that the distribution of Before-Tax Contributions exceeds such Designated Roth Contributions, such distribution shall
be treated as Untaxed Contributions.        

(5) 
    Distributions Commencing After Participant s Death . Distributions commencing after the Participant s death shall be completed within
five years after the death of the Participant, except that (i) effective with respect to any Participant whose death occurs on or after January 1, 1995, regardless of when such Participant s employment terminated, if the
Participant s Beneficiary is the Participant s Spouse, distribution may be deferred until the date on which the Participant would have attained age
70  1   2  had he or she survived and (ii) if the Participant s Beneficiary is a natural person other than the Participant s Spouse and
distributions commence not     
      56  

later than one year after the Participant s death, such distributions may be made over a period not longer than the life expectancy of such Beneficiary. If at the time of the
Participant s death, distribution of the Participant s benefit has commenced, the remaining portion of the Participant s benefit shall be paid in the manner elected by the Participant s Beneficiary, but at least as rapidly as was
the method of distribution being used prior to the Participant s death.        

(6) 
  Distribution of Rollover Account After Termination Date . A Participant who has terminated employment or the Beneficiary of such Participant, as the case may be, may elect by calling the VRU, or in such other
manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator prior to the time his or her vested account balance is distributed under this Section 8.4 to have distribution of the balance of his or her Rollover Account commence at such prior time as the
Participant or Beneficiary shall elect, provided that, while any loan to the Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, such distribution shall be made only to the extent that the balance of such Participant s vested account
balance remaining after such distribution will equal or exceed the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.        

(7) 
  Compliance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all distributions will be made in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, including the minimum distribution incidental death benefit requirement thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount that would be a required minimum distribution described in section 401(a)(9) of the Code which is
attributable to the 2009 calendar year will not be distributed to a Participant, or his or her Beneficiary, as applicable, unless such individual elects to receive such distribution. In addition, the five-year period described in subparagraph
(5) above shall be determined without regard to calendar year 2009.      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary and except as provided in subparagraph (4) above, in the event that the recordkeeper for the Plan is changed, distributions may be made at such time as prescribed by the Administrator in order to accommodate the transfer of records to
the new recordkeeper.     Section 8.5 .  Designation of Beneficiary .  
 Each Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (who may be designated contingently or successively and that
may be an entity other than a natural person) to receive any distribution to be made under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) upon the death of such Participant or, in the case of a Participant who dies
subsequent to termination of his or her employment but prior to the distribution of the entire  
      57  

amount to which he or she is entitled under the Plan, any undistributed balance to which such Participant would have been entitled,  provided ,  however , that no such designation (or
change thereof) shall be effective if the Participant was married on the date of the Participant s death unless such designation (or change thereof) was consented to at the time of such designation (or change thereof) by the person who was the
Participant s Spouse, in writing, acknowledging the effect of such consent and witnessed by a notary public or a Plan representative, or it is established to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such consent could not be obtained because
the Participant s Spouse cannot be located or such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. Subject to the preceding sentence, a Participant may from time to time, without the consent of any Beneficiary, change or cancel any
such designation. Such designation and each change therein shall be made in the form prescribed by the Administrator and shall be filed with the Administrator. A Participant s beneficiary designation in effect under the PECO Energy Company
Employee Savings Plan immediately prior to March 31, 2001 shall remain in effect under the Plan on and after March 31, 2001 until such time as such designation is changed or canceled in accordance with this Section 8.5. If (i) no
Beneficiary has been named by a deceased Participant, (ii) such designation is not effective pursuant to the proviso contained in the first sentence of this section, or (iii) the designated Beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, any
undistributed balance of the deceased Participant shall be distributed by the Trustee at the direction of the Administrator (a) to the surviving Spouse of such deceased Participant, if any, or (b) if there is no surviving Spouse, to the

   PARTICIPATION BY OTHER EMPLOYERS  
  Section 12.1 .  Adoption of Plan .  
 With the consent of the Company, any entity may become a participating Employer under the Plan by (a) taking such action as shall be
necessary to adopt the Plan and (b) executing and delivering such instruments and taking such other action as may be necessary or desirable to put the Plan into effect with respect to such entity.  
      77  

Section 12.2 .  Withdrawal from Participation .  
 Any Employer shall terminate its participation in the Plan at any time, under such circumstances as the Company may provide, by delivering to
the Company a duly certified copy of a resolution of its board of directors (or other governing body) to that effect, or by ceasing to be a member of the same controlled group as the Company (within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Code).  
  Section 12.3 .  Company as Agent for Employers .  
 Each entity that becomes a participating Employer pursuant to Section 12.1 (relating to adoption of Plan) or Article 13 (relating to
continuance by a successor) by so doing shall be deemed to have appointed the Company its agent to exercise on its behalf all of the powers and authorities hereby conferred upon the Company by the terms of the Plan, including, but not by way of
limitation, the power to amend and terminate the Plan. The authority of the Company to act as such agent shall continue unless and until the portion of the Trust Fund held for the benefit of Employees of the particular Employer and their
Beneficiaries is set aside in a separate Trust Fund as provided in Section 16.2 (relating to establishment of separate trust).  
  ARTICLE 13   
   CONTINUANCE BY A SUCCESSOR  
 In the event that the Employer is reorganized by way of merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or otherwise, so that another entity
succeeds to all or substantially all of the Employer s business, such successor entity may be substituted for the Employer under the Plan by adopting the Plan and becoming a party to the Trust agreement. Contributions by the Employer shall be
automatically suspended from the effective date of any such reorganization until the date upon which the substitution of such successor entity for the Employer under the Plan becomes effective.  
      78  

If, within 90 days following the effective date of any such reorganization, such successor entity shall not have elected to become a party to the Plan, or if the Employer adopts a plan of
complete liquidation other than in connection with a reorganization, the Plan shall be automatically terminated with respect to Employees of such Employer as of the close of business on the 90th day following the effective date of such
reorganization or as of the close of business on the date of adoption of such plan of complete liquidation, as the case may be, and the Administrator shall direct the Trustee to distribute the portion of the Trust Fund applicable to such Employer in
the manner provided in Article 16 (relating to establishment of separate plan and termination).    If such successor entity is substituted
for an Employer by electing to become a party to the Plan as described above, then, for all purposes of the Plan, employment of such Employee with such Employer, including service with and compensation paid by such Employer, shall be considered to
be employment with an Employer.     ARTICLE 14   
   MISCELLANEOUS  
  Section 14.1 .  Expenses .

engaged in the administration of the Plan or the Trust), the expenses of the Administrator and the Investment Office, the fees of counsel and any agents for the Administrator and the Investment Office, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the fees
of counsel for the Trustee and other administrative expenses shall, to the extent permitted by law, be paid from the Trust Fund to the extent such  
      79  

expenses are not paid by the Employers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may authorize an Employer to pay any expenses, and the Employer shall be reimbursed from the Trust Fund
for such payments. The Administrator, in its discretion, having regard to the nature of a particular expense, shall determine the portion of the expense that is to be borne by each Employer.  
  Section 14.2 .   Non-Assignability  .  
 (a)  In general . It is a condition of the Plan, and all rights of each Participant and Beneficiary shall be subject thereto, that no
right or interest of any Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan shall be assignable or transferable in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, but not by way of limitation, execution, levy, garnishment,
attachment, pledge or bankruptcy, but excluding devolution by death or mental incompetency, and no right or interest of any Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of such Participant or
Beneficiary, including claims for alimony or the support of any Spouse, except as provided below.    (b)  Exception for Qualified Domestic
Relations Orders . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if a Participant s account balance under the Plan, or any portion thereof, is the subject of one or more qualified domestic relations orders, as defined below,
such account balance or portion thereof shall be paid to the person and at the time and in the manner specified in any such order. For purposes of this paragraph (b),  qualified domestic relations order  shall mean any  domestic
relations order  as defined in Section 11.3 (relating to procedures for domestic relations orders) that creates (or recognizes the existence of) or assigns to a person other than the Participant (an  alternate payee ) rights to
all or a portion of the Participant s account balance under the Plan, and:    (A) clearly specifies  

(i) 
 the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the Participant and each alternate payee covered by such order,    
      80  

(ii) 
 the amount or percentage of this Participant s benefits to be paid by the Plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,    

(iii) 
 the number of payments to, or period of time for which, such order applies, and        

(iv) 
 each plan to which such order applies;      (B) does not require  

(i) 
 the Plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided under the Plan at the time such order is issued,    

(ii) 
 the Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial equivalence), and        

(iii) 
 the payment of benefits to an alternate payee that at the time such order is issued already are required to be paid to a different alternate payee under a prior qualified domestic relations order; and    
 (C) does not require the commencement of payment of benefits to any alternate payee before the earlier of (I) the date on
which the Participant is entitled to a distribution under the Plan and (II) the date the Participant attains age 50, except that the order may require the commencement of payment of benefits as soon as administratively practicable after the date
such order is determined by the Administrator to be a  qualified domestic relations order     all as determined by the Administrator pursuant to
the procedures contained in Section 11.3 (relating to procedures for domestic relations orders). Any amounts subject to a domestic relations order prior to determination of its status as a qualified domestic relations order that but for such
order would be paid to the Participant shall be segregated in a separate account or an escrow account pending such determination. If within the reasonable time period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made
under a domestic relations order the Administrator determines that the domestic relations order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order, the amount so segregated (plus any interest thereof) shall be paid to the alternate payee. If such
determination is not made within such reasonable time period, then the amount so  
      81  

segregated (plus any interest thereon), shall, as soon as practicable after the end of such reasonable time period, be paid to the Participant. Any determination regarding the status of such
order after such reasonable time period shall be applied only to payments on or after the date of such determination.  
  Section 14.3 .  Employment  Non-Contractual  .  
 The Plan confers no right upon an Employee to continue in employment.  
  Section 14.4 .  Limitation of Rights .  
 A Participant or distributee shall have no right, title or claim in or to any specific asset of the Trust Fund, but shall have the right only
to distributions from the Trust Fund on the terms and conditions herein provided.     Section 14.5 .  Merger or Consolidation
with Another Plan .    A merger or consolidation with, or transfer of assets or liabilities to, any other plan shall not be effected
unless the terms of such merger, consolidation or transfer are such that each Participant, distributee, Beneficiary or other person entitled to receive benefits from the Plan would, if the Plan were to terminate immediately after the merger,
consolidation or transfer, receive a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit such person would be entitled to receive if the Plan were to terminate immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer.  
  Section 14.6 .  Gender and Plurals .  
 Wherever used in the Plan, words in the masculine gender shall include masculine or feminine gender, and, unless the context otherwise
requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.  
      82  

Section 14.7 .  Applicable Law .  
 Except to the extent preempted by applicable federal law or otherwise provided under the terms of the Plan, the Plan and all rights hereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.     Section 14.8 .  Severability .
   If a provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the
Plan and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included in the Plan.  
  Section 14.9 .  No Guarantee .  
 Neither the Administrator or the Investment Office, the Employer, nor the Trustee in any way guarantees the Trust from loss or depreciation
nor the payment of any money that may be or become due to any person from the Trust Fund. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any Participant, distributee, or Beneficiary an interest in any specific part of the Trust Fund or any other
interest except the right to receive benefits out of the Trust Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the Trust Fund.  
  Section 14.10 .  Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan .  
 Except for actions to which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413 of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action
relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant receives a final decision from the Company s Vice President, Health   Benefits (or such other officer designated
from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two
years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or
its fiduciaries from recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal or equitable action against any party.  
      83  

Section 14.11 .  Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan .  
 Any legal action involving the Plan that is brought by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the federal
courts located in the Northern District of Illinois or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whichever is most convenient, and no other federal or state court.  
  Section 14.12 .  Legal Fees .  
 Any award of legal fees in connection with an action involving the Plan shall be calculated pursuant to a method that results in the lowest
amount of fees being paid, which amount shall be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to (a) administrative proceedings under the Plan, (b) unsuccessful claims brought by a
Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or (c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be no enhancement for the risk of contingency, nonpayment or any other risk nor shall there be
applied a contingency multiplier or any other multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the Administrator, the Investment Office, the Vice President, Health   Benefits, any Plan
fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan Parties ), legal fees of the Plan Parties in connection with such action shall be paid by
the Participant, Beneficiary or other person bringing the action, unless the court specifically finds that there was a reasonable basis for the action.  
      84  

ARTICLE 15   
  TOP-HEAVY  PLAN REQUIREMENTS  
  Section 15.1 .   Top-Heavy  Plan Determination .  
 If as of the determination date (as defined in Section 15.2) for any Plan Year (a) the sum of the account balances under the Plan
and all other defined contribution plans in the aggregation group (as defined in Section 15.2) and (b) the present value of accrued benefits under all defined benefit plans in such aggregation group of all Participants in such plans who
are key employees (as defined in Section 15.2) for such Plan Year exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate of the account balances and present value of accrued benefits of all participants in such plans as of the determination date (as defined in
Section 15.2), then this Plan shall be a  top-heavy  plan for such Plan Year, and the requirements of Sections 15.3 (relating to minimum contribution for top-heavy years) shall be applicable for such Plan
Year as of the first day thereof. If the Plan shall be a  top-heavy  plan for any Plan Year and not be a  top-heavy  plan for any subsequent Plan Year, the requirements of
this Article shall not be applicable for such subsequent Plan Year.     Section 15.2 .  Definitions and Special Rules .  
 (a)  Definitions . For purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply:  

(1) 
  Determination Date . The determination date for all plans in the aggregation group shall be the last day of the preceding Plan Year, and the valuation date applicable to a determination date shall be (i) in
the case of a defined contribution plan, the date as of which account balances are determined which is coincident with or immediately precedes the determination date, and (ii) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the date as of which the most
recent actuarial valuation for the Plan Year that includes the determination date is prepared, except that if any such plan specifies a different determination or valuation date, such different date shall be used with respect to such plan.

(2) 
  Aggregation Group . The aggregation group shall consist of (a) each plan of an Employer in which a key Employee is a participant, (b) each other plan that enables such a plan to be qualified under
section 401(a) of the Code, and (c) any other plans of an Employer that the Company designates as part of the aggregation group and that shall permit the aggregation group to continue to meet the requirements of sections 401(a) and 410 of the
Code with such other plan being taken into account.    
      85  

(3) 
  Key Employee . Key Employee shall have the meaning set forth in section 416(i) of the Code.        

(4) 
  Compensation . Compensation shall have the meaning set forth in section 1.415(c)-2 of the Regulations.    
 (b)  Special Rules . For the purpose of determining the accrued benefit or account balance of a Participant, the accrued benefit or
account balance of any person who has not performed services for an employer at any time during the  1-year  period ending on the determination date shall not be taken into account pursuant to this Section. Any
person who received a distribution from a plan (including a plan that has terminated) in the aggregation group during the  1-year  period ending on the last day of the preceding Plan Year shall be treated as a
Participant in such plan, and any such distribution shall be included in such Participant s account balance or accrued benefit, except that in the case of any distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death or
disability, this sentence shall be applied by substituting  5-year period  for the  1-year period  stated herein.  
  Section 15.3 .  Minimum Contribution for  Top-Heavy  Years .  
 Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the sum of the Employer contributions under Article 4 (other than Before-Tax
Contributions described in Section 4.1) allocated to the account of each Participant (other than a key Employee) during any Plan Year and the forfeitures allocated to the account of such Participant (other than a key Employee) during any Plan
Year for which the Plan is a  top-heavy  plan shall in no event be less than the lesser of (i) 3% of such Participant s compensation during such Plan Year and (ii) the highest percentage at which
contributions are made on behalf of any key Employee for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the percentage determined pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence is less than 3%, such percentage shall be
recalculated by including Before-Tax Contributions made  
      86  

on behalf of key employees. Such minimum contribution shall be made even if, under other provisions of the Plan, the Participant would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation or would
receive a lesser allocation for the year because of (i) the Participant s failure to complete 1,000 Hours of Service, or (ii) compensation of less than a stated amount. If, during any Plan Year for which this Section 15.3 is
applicable, a defined benefit plan is included in the aggregation group and such defined benefit plan is a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year, the percentage set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section shall be 5%. The
percentage referred to in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section shall be obtained by dividing the aggregate of contributions made pursuant to Article 4 and pursuant to any other defined contribution plan that is required to be
included in the aggregation group (other than a defined contribution plan that enables a defined benefit plan that is required to be included in such group to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code) during the Plan Year on behalf of such key
Employee by such key Employee s compensation for the Plan Year. Notwithstanding the above, the provisions of this Section 15.3 shall not apply for any Plan Year with respect to an Eligible Employee who has accrued the defined benefit
minimum provided under section 416 of the Code under a qualified defined benefit plan maintained by an Employer or Affiliate.     ARTICLE
16      AMENDMENT, ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATE PLAN AND TERMINATION  
  Section 16.1 .  Amendment .  
 The Company may at any time and from time to time amend or modify the Plan by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or the
Compensation Committee thereof;  provided , however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or
 
      87  

modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase
in annual expense or liability exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater responsibility. No amendment shall be made in respect of Eligible Employees who are members of a bargaining unit represented by
IBEW Local Union 15 that is inconsistent with that portion of the collective bargaining agreement between such an Employer and IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan.  
  Section 16.2 .  Establishment of Separate Plan .  
 If an Employer withdraws from the Plan under Section 12.2 (relating to withdrawal from participation), the Administrator may determine
the portion of the Trust Fund held by the Trustee that is applicable to the Participants and former Participants of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate such portion in a separate Trust Fund. Such separate Trust Fund shall thereafter be
held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.    The portion of the Trust Fund applicable to the Participants and
former Participants of a particular Employer shall be the sum of:      

(a) 
 the total amount credited to all accounts that are applicable to the Participants and former Participants of such Employer and        

(b) 
 an amount that bears the same ratio to the excess, if any, of        

(i) 
 the total value of the Trust Fund over        

(ii) 
 the total amount credited to all accounts      as the total amount credited to the accounts that are applicable to
the Participants of such Employer bears to the total amount credited to such accounts of all Participants.  
      88  

Section 16.3 .  Termination and Distributions upon Termination of the Plan .  
 The Company has established the Plan with the bona fide intention and expectation that contributions will be continued indefinitely, but the
Company will not have any obligation or liability whatsoever to maintain the Plan for any given length of time and may terminate the Plan at any time by resolution of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee thereof, to that effect,
without any liability whatsoever for any such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan shall not be terminated in respect of Eligible Employees who are members of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 if such
termination is inconsistent with the portion of the collective bargaining agreement between the Employer of such Eligible Employees and IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan. The Plan will be deemed terminated: (a) if and when the Company is
judicially declared bankrupt, or (b) upon dissolution of the Company.    Upon termination of the Plan by the Company or withdrawal from
participation in the Plan by any Employer pursuant to Section 12.2 (relating to withdrawal from participation) or the partial termination of the Plan with respect to a group of Employees or complete discontinuance of contributions hereunder,
distributions shall be made to each affected Participant or other persons entitled to distributions pursuant to Article 8 (relating to withdrawals and distributions). If the entire Plan is terminating, upon the completion of distribution to all
Participants, the Trust will terminate, the Trustee will be relieved from all liability under the Trust, and no Participant or other person will have any claims thereunder, except as required by applicable law.  
 Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, no distribution shall be made to any Participant (i) until he or she attains age 59  1   2  except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) or (ii) if a successor plan, as defined in
Regulations, is established or maintained by the Participant s Employer.  
      89  

To the extent that no discrimination in value results, any distribution after termination or
partial termination of the Plan may be made, in whole or in part, in cash, in securities or other assets in kind, or in non-transferable annuity contracts, as the Administrator (in its discretion) may determine. All non-cash distributions shall be
valued at fair market value at date of distribution.    If the Internal Revenue Service refuses to issue an initial, favorable determination
letter that the Plan and Trust Fund as adopted by an Employer meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, the Employer may terminate its participation in the Plan
and shall direct the Trustee to pay and deliver the portion of the Trust Fund applicable to the Participants of such Employer, determined pursuant to Section 16.2 (relating to establishment of separate plan) to such Employer and such Employer
shall pay to Participants or their beneficiaries the part of such Employer s portion of the Trust Fund as is attributable to contributions made by Participants.  
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no distribution shall be made pursuant to this Section 16.3 (relating to
termination and distribution upon termination of the Plan) solely due to the termination of this Plan if, within the meaning of applicable Regulations, the employer establishes or maintains an alternative defined contribution plan.  
  Section 16.4 .  Trust Fund to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their Beneficiaries .  
 Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.5 (relating to the limitation on Employer contributions), 7.4 (relating to limitations on
allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code) and 16.3 (relating to termination and distributions upon termination of the Plan), and any other provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Trust
Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries either by operation or termination of the Plan, power of amendment or other means.  
      90  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized
officer on this                day of December, 2012.

 A.  Transfers to this Plan . Whenever an individual who is employed by an Affiliate that is not an Employer has a change in employment
status that results in such individual (a) becoming an Eligible Employee and (b) being ineligible to make additional elective contributions under a plan maintained by such Affiliate (an  Affiliate Plan ), such Eligible Employee
may elect to transfer his or her benefits under the Affiliate Plan to this Plan. Such election must be conditioned upon a voluntary, fully-informed election by the Eligible Employee. In the event that the Eligible Employee makes such election, his

this Plan and the benefits transferred to the Affiliate Plan shall be subject to the terms of, and paid as prescribed by, the Affiliate Plan, and the terms of this Plan shall not apply with respect to such benefits.  
      II-2  

SUPPLEMENT III  
 Merger of Certain AmerGen Plans into this Plan  
  Purpose . The purpose of this Supplement III is to reflect the merger of the AmerGen Clinton Employee Savings Plan for Nonbargaining
Employees (the  Clinton Plan ) and the AmerGen TMI and Oyster Creek Employee Savings Plan for Nonbargaining Employees (collectively, the  AmerGen Plans ) into the Plan effective February 1, 2004 (the  Merger Date )
and to preserve those provisions of the AmerGenPlans that cannot be eliminated by amendment without violating section 411(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations thereunder.  
  Definitions . Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, a term defined in the Plan shall have the same meanings for purposes of
this Supplement III.     Conflicts Between the Plan and this Supplement III . This Supplement III and the Plan together comprise the

  PARTICIPATION     Section 3.1

completes an Hour of Service with an Employer as an Eligible Employee.    (b)  Other Employees Prior to the Effective Date . Each
individual who (a) is, at any time between January 1, 2002 and April 30, 2002, an Employee and (b) was, on December 31, 2000, a participant in either the ComEd Plan (other than a participant the terms of whose employment are

manner prescribed by the  Committee,  as such term was defined in the Plan prior to June 1, 2006, to either (i) continue participating in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, on and after January 1, 2002 (or

described in clause (i) hereof as of  
      10  

December 31, 2001 and begin participating in the Plan as of January 1, 2002 (or, if later, his or her employment or reemployment date). Each such Eligible Employee who affirmatively
elects to participate in the Plan in lieu of participation in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan shall become a Participant as of January 1, 2002 (or, if later, his or her employment or reemployment date), unless such Participant receives a
notification (the  Notice ) from an Employer that his or her employment with the Employers and their Affiliates will be terminated on or before December 31, 2002 and that such Participant is eligible for severance benefits under the
Exelon Corporation Merger Separation Plan for Designated Management Employees or any other severance plan maintained by an Employer or an Affiliate. An Eligible Employee who receives a Notice shall not become a Participant, notwithstanding such
Eligible Employee s election to participate in the Plan. An Eligible Employee (i) who receives a Notice, but whose employment does not terminate on or before December 31, 2002, or (ii) whose employment terminates before
December 31, 2002 without the Employee receiving a Notice shall become a Participant as of January 1, 2002 (or, if later, his or her employment or reemployment date) if such Employee elects, in the time and manner prescribed by the
 Committee,  as such term was defined in the Plan prior to June 1, 2006, to participate in the Plan.    In the case of an
Eligible Employee who became an employee of the Power Team during 2003 pursuant to Exelon Way, such Eligible Employee shall continue to be a Participant. In addition, each Eligible Employee who was an employee of the Power Team on any date in 2003
and who became an employee of a participating business unit of an Employer during 2003 in connection with Exelon Way shall continue to be a Participant only if such Employee was a Participant prior to the date on which such Employee became an
employee of a participating business unit of an Employer. Effective as of January 1, 2004, each individual (i) who either (A) 
      11  

is an employee of the Power Team or (B) transferred employment from the Power Team to a participating business unit of an Employer during 2003 pursuant to Exelon Way, (ii) who became an
Eligible Employee on or after January 1, 2004 and (iii) who either (A) has a frozen accrued benefit under this Plan or (B) does not have an accrued benefit under either the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan shall become a Participant
as of the later of January 1, 2004 and the date the Eligible Employee completes an Hour of Service with an Employer as an Eligible Employee. In addition, each Eligible Employee (i) who either (A) is an employee of the Power Team or

either the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, (iv) who is not described in the preceding sentence and (v) who did not previously make a valid election pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner
prescribed by the  Committee,  as such term was defined in the Plan prior to June 1, 2006, to either (A) resume or continue participation in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, as of January 1, 2004 or
(B) participate in the Plan as of January 1, 2004. Each such Eligible Employee who affirmatively elects to participate in the Plan in lieu of participation in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan shall become a Participant as of January, 1,
2004.    (c)  Transfer of Benefits and Assets to Plan . If an Employee described in paragraph (b) above elects to participate in
the Plan in lieu of participating in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, the Employee s accrued benefit under either such plan, determined as of December 31, 2001, or December 31, 2003, as the case may be, in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable plan, shall be transferred to the Plan. An amount of assets that is equal to the present value of the Employee s accrued benefit described in the preceding sentence
 
      12  

determined using the methods and assumptions prescribed by section 4044 of ERISA shall also be transferred to the Plan. Such transfer of benefits and assets related thereto shall occur as soon as
practicable after the Eligible Employee makes the election described in paragraph (b) above. Each Participant whose benefits are so transferred shall be permitted to have his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit paid in any of the optional forms of
benefit listed in the applicable Schedule in lieu of the forms provided hereunder. The provisions set forth in the applicable Schedule shall govern all matters relating to a Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit.  
 In the event that an Eligible Employee whose accrued benefit under the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, and related assets, is transferred to the
Plan receives a Notice and has a Termination of Employment on or before December 31, 2002, the accrued benefit, and related assets, transferred to the Plan shall be transferred back to the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, and
the amount of the pension benefit accrued by such Employee during 2002 (if any) shall be determined under the terms of the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as applicable, rather than the Plan. Such transfer shall occur as soon as administratively
practicable.    Section 3.2  Transfer to Affiliates . If a Participant is transferred from one Employer to another Employer or from an
Employer to an Affiliate that is not an Employer, then such transfer shall not terminate the Participant s participation in the Plan and the Participant shall continue to participate in the Plan until an event occurs that would have entitled
the Participant to a complete distribution of the Participant s vested Pension had the Participant continued to be employed by an Employer until the occurrence of such event. Nevertheless, except to the extent provided in Section 9.3 (relating
to employment by related entities) or Section 9.7 (relating to change in employment status or transfer to affiliate), a Participant shall not be entitled to receive Service Credits under Section 6.1(c) (relating to Service Credits) during
any period of employment by  
      13  

any Affiliate that is not an Employer with respect to such Participant, and periods of employment with an Affiliate that is not an Employer with respect to such Participant shall be taken into
account only to the extent set forth in Section 9.3 (relating to employment by related entities) or Section 9.7 (relating to change in employment status or transfer to affiliate).  
 Section 3.3  Cessation of Participation . An individual s participation in the Plan shall cease upon the date the individual is no
longer eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan or upon the individual s Termination of Employment if the individual has not satisfied the Vesting Requirement upon the date of his or her Termination of Employment.  
 Section 3.4  Rehired Participants . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a Participant terminates employment and
is reemployed as an Employee under circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees, including that the Participant
waives participation in, or additional benefits and accruals under the Plan, such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any Service Credits under Section 6.1(c) (relating to Service Credits) during such period of reemployment.  
  ARTICLE 4      SOURCE OF
CONTRIBUTIONS     Section 4.1  Source of Contributions . The Employers intend to make contributions to the Trust of amounts which,
in the aggregate over a period of time, shall be sufficient to finance the benefits provided by the Plan. Any such contributions shall be in such amounts and shall be made in such manner and at such time as the Company may from time to time
determine in accordance with the funding policy it establishes and consistent with minimum funding standards under section 412 of the Code, provided, however, that all contributions made by the Employers  
      14  

for any Plan Year shall be made prior to the due date, including extensions thereof, of the Employers  federal income tax return for the taxable year of the Employers which coincides with
such Plan Year. The Company may rely on the advice of actuaries in establishing and carrying out a funding policy. Forfeitures arising under the Plan for any reason shall be applied to reduce the cost of the Plan, not to increase the benefits
otherwise payable to the Participants.    Section 4.2  Limitation on Contributions . The contributions of an Employer for any Plan Year
shall not exceed the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year of such Employer that ends with or within such Plan Year. Any contribution made by an Employer by reason of
a good faith mistake of fact, or the portion of any contribution made by an Employer that exceeds the maximum amount for which a deduction is currently allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes, shall upon the request of such
Employer be returned by the Trustee to the Employer. An Employer s request and the return of any such contribution must be made within one year after such contribution was mistakenly made or after the deduction of such excess portion of such
contribution was disallowed, as the case may be. The amount to be returned to an Employer pursuant to this Section shall be the excess of (i) the amount contributed over (ii) the amount that would have been contributed had there not been a
mistake of fact or the maximum amount that is so deductible, as the case may be. Earnings attributable to the mistaken contribution shall not be returned to the Employer, but losses attributable thereto shall reduce the amount to be so returned.

ARTICLE 5   
  TRUST     A trust (the
 Trust ) has been created by the execution of a trust agreement between the Company and a trustee (the  Trustee ) for purposes of holding and administering the assets of the Plan. All contributions under the Plan shall be paid to
the Trustee. The Trustee shall hold all monies and other property received by it and invest and reinvest the same, together with the income therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the provisions of such trust
agreement. The Trustee shall make distributions from the Trust Fund at such time or times to such person or persons and in such amounts as the Administrator directs in accordance with the Plan.  
  ARTICLE 6      PARTICIPANT

Cash Balance Account of a Participant described in this paragraph (d)(1) shall be credited, as of the last day of each Plan Year during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan
Year, with an amount equal to the product of (i) the  Pre-

preceding the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the denominator of which is twelve, and such Investment Credit shall be made as of the last day of the month before such Pension

or After January 1, 2013 (Other than Craft Employees) . The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only with respect to the Cash Balance Account of a Participant who became a Participant on or after January 1, 2013, other than a Craft Employee.

      20  

or Affiliate as a result of a disability with respect to which such Participant is receiving benefits under any Employer s or Affiliate s long-term disability plan shall be credited

which is the number of whole calendar months during such Plan Year prior to and including the month which contains the date immediately preceding the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the denominator of which is twelve, and such
Investment Credit shall be made as of the last day of the month before such Pension Starting Date prior to the crediting of any Service Credit for such year. Except to the extent provided in Section 7.2(d)(2) (relating to special rules

into account any adjustment under clause (iv) thereof), and (B) 7%.    (e)  Additional Credit . If, as of a
Participant s Pension Starting Date, the amount described in (1) below exceeds the amount described in (2) below, an amount equal to the difference between such amounts shall be credited the Participant s Cash Balance Account as
of the day before such Pension Starting Date:    (1) The cumulative amount that would have been credited to the Participant s Cash
Balance Account if the Plan Interest Rate described in Section 6.1(d) of the Plan (relating to Investment Credits) were credited to the Participant s  Opening Credit  (as defined below) for each Plan Year during which the
Participant is a Participant at the Plan Interest Rate then in effect, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year.  
      21  

(2) The cumulative amount that would have been credited to the Participant s Cash Balance
Account if 6.5% interest were credited to the Participant s  Opening Credit  (as defined below) for all Plan Years during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an eligible Employee during such Plan
Year.    If the amount described in (1) above is equal to or less than the amount described in (2) above, no amount shall be
credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account pursuant to this paragraph (e). In addition, no amount shall be credited pursuant to this paragraph (e) if a Participant does not have an Accrued Frozen Benefit.

Beneficiaries, shall receive a distribution in the amount and in the form described in Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) (relating to lump sum distribution) as soon as practicable following such Termination of Employment in satisfaction of all
benefits to which the Participant or his or her Beneficiaries, as the case may be, is entitled under the Plan.    (d)  Deemed

  Option 3 :  Survivor Annuity . A reduced Pension payable to the Participant during the Participant s lifetime

lifetime of such Designated Beneficiary, the aggregate amount of which are the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Benefit attributable to his or her Cash Balance Account and the Schedule Equivalent of his or her Accrued Frozen
Benefit, if any.    (d)  Special Rules Regarding Pensions .  
 (1) If a Participant s spouse dies before the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the Participant has not elected
an optional form of distribution described in paragraph (c) of this Section (relating to optional forms of distribution), the Participant shall again be entitled to make an election under this Section.  
 (2) If a Pension commences pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (relating to distributions to five percent owners) while a
Participant remains employed by an Employer, such Pension shall be actuarially adjusted as of January 1 following the end of each calendar year during which such Participant remains employed by an Employer to reflect any additional Service
Credits and Investment Credits credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year.  
 (3) If a Participant elects Option 3 under Section 7.2(c) and the Participant s Beneficiary is other than the
Participant s Spouse, the Pension payable to the Participant and to the Beneficiary shall be adjusted as is necessary to satisfy the incidental benefit requirement under section 401(a)(9) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, the form and timing of all distributions under the Plan to any Participant shall be in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, including the incidental death benefit requirements of
Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Code and Treasury Regulation  1.401(a)(9)-2 through Treasury Regulation  1.401(a)(9)-9.  
      26  

Section 7.3  Death Benefits . (a)  Eligibility . If a Participant who has
satisfied the Vesting Requirement dies prior to his or her Pension Starting Date, the Participant s surviving Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a benefit under this Section. In addition, if a Participant dies while an Employee, the
Participant s surviving Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a benefit under this Section, regardless of whether the Participant has satisfied the Vesting Requirement.  
 (b)  Form of Payment . A surviving Beneficiary who is entitled to a distribution of the Participant s benefit under this Section

Participant s death, except that if the Participant s surviving Beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse, distribution to such surviving Spouse may commence at the same time as described in subparagraph (2). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, should any benefit be payable pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this Section 7.3(b) (relating to statutory surviving Spouse s benefit), the amount of any benefit payable pursuant to this subparagraph (1) shall be
reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit payable pursuant to such subparagraph (2).    (2)  Statutory Surviving
Spouse s Benefit . If the Participant is survived by a Spouse to whom the Participant was married throughout the one-year period ending on the date of the Participant s death, then, unless such Participant has with his or her
Spouse s consent waived the benefit described herein in the manner described in Section 7.4(e) (relating to waiver of statutory surviving Spouse s benefit), such Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor s Pension commencing
as of any January 1 coinciding with or following the date of the Participant s death or any succeeding January 1 (but not later than the January 1 immediately preceding or coinciding with the date the Participant would have
attained age 70-1/2 had he or she survived) and continuing for the lifetime of such Spouse in an amount equal to the Pension such Spouse would have received pursuant to a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if the Participant had survived until
such day and such Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity had commenced on such day and the Participant had died immediately after such annuity commenced, but determined without regard to any Service Credits that would have been credited to the
Participant s Cash Balance Account with respect to any periods subsequent to the Participant s Termination of Employment.  
      27  

(c) The death benefits provided by this Section shall not be effective to the extent required to
comply with the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.    Section 7.4  Election and Waiver Procedures . (a)  Election of
Optional Form of Benefit . Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section (relating to spousal consent to election of optional form of benefit or beneficiary designation), a Participant may elect, change or revoke any form of distribution provided
under Section 7.2 (relating to forms of distribution) at any time during the 90-day period ending on the later of the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the date the Participant s benefit is paid or commences. Such an election,
change or revocation shall be made by the Participant delivering a written notice describing the election, change or revocation to the Administrator on a form provided by the Administrator for this purpose.  
 (b)  Beneficiary Designation . Subject to paragraph (e) below (relating to waiver of statutory surviving spouse s benefit),
each Participant may designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(1) (relating to lump sum pre-retirement death benefit) in the event of his or her death. A Participant may from time to time, without the
consent of any Beneficiary, change or cancel any such designation. Such designation and each change therein shall be made in the form prescribed by the Administrator and shall be filed with the Administrator. If no Beneficiary has been designated by
a deceased Participant, or the designated Beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(1) (relating to lump sum pre-retirement death benefit) shall be made by the Trustee at the direction of the
Administrator (i) to the surviving Spouse of such deceased Participant, if any, or (ii) if there shall be no surviving Spouse, to the surviving children of such deceased Participant,  
      28  

if any, in equal shares, or (iii) if there shall be no surviving Spouse or surviving children, to the executor or administrator of the estate of such deceased Participant, or (iv) if no
executor or administrator shall have been appointed for the estate of such deceased Participant within six months following the date of the Participant s death, in equal shares to the person or persons who would be entitled under the intestate
succession laws of the state of the Participant s domicile to receive the Participant s personal estate. The marriage of a Participant shall be deemed to revoke any prior designation of a Beneficiary made by him or her and a divorce shall
be deemed to revoke any prior designation of the Participant s divorced Spouse if written evidence of such marriage or divorce shall be received by the Administrator before distribution shall have been made in accordance with such designation.
If, within a period of three years following any Participant s death or other termination of employment by an Employer, the Administrator in the exercise of reasonable diligence has been unable to locate the person or persons entitled to
benefits under this Article in respect of such Participant, the rights of such person or persons shall be forfeited and the Administrator shall direct the Trustee to pay such benefit or benefits to the person or persons next entitled thereto under
the succession prescribed by this Section.    (c)  Spousal Consent to Election of Optional Form of Benefit or Beneficiary Designation .
If a Participant is married on his or her Pension Starting Date, and if after giving effect to an election, revocation or change described in paragraph (a) of this Section (relating to election of optional form of benefit) the
Participant s Spouse would not be entitled to receive a survivor s benefit at least equal to that provided by Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants), such election, revocation or
change shall not be effective unless it shall have been consented to at the time of such election, revocation or change in writing by the Participant s Spouse and such consent acknowledges the effect of such election
 
      29  

and is witnessed by a notary public. The consent of a Spouse to such an election, revocation or change shall not be required if it is established to the satisfaction of the Administrator that
such consent cannot be obtained because there is no Spouse, the Spouse cannot be located or such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. If the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the consent may be executed by the
Spouse s legal guardian (including the Participant, if the Participant is the legal guardian). An election of an optional form of distribution shall be deemed a rejection of the distribution form provided by paragraph (a) or (b) of
Section 7.2 (relating to manner of distribution with respect to unmarried Participants and manner of distribution with respect to married Participants). The consent of a Spouse otherwise required by this paragraph shall not be necessary for a
distribution required by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.    (d)  Notice of Availability of Optional Forms of Benefit . No less
than 30 days (or such shorter period as may be permitted by applicable law) and no more than 90 days before the later of a Participant s Pension Starting Date and the date the Participant s benefit is paid or commences, the Administrator
shall give the Participant by mail or personal delivery written notice in non-technical language that he or she may elect an optional form of distribution set forth in Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution); provided, however, that the
Participant may waive (with applicable spousal consent) such 30-day notice period as long as the Participant s distribution commences not less than eight days after such notice is provided. Such notice shall include a general description of the
eligibility conditions and other material features of the optional forms of distribution provided under the Plan; the circumstances under which the basic forms of distribution set forth in Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution) will be
provided unless a Participant, with the consent of the Participant s Spouse, elects otherwise; the  
      30  

Participant s right to revoke any such election; and information regarding the financial effect, in terms of dollars per payment, upon his or her distribution if he or she elects an optional
form of distribution or revokes any prior election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice described in the previous paragraph may be provided to the Participant subsequent to the Participant s Pension Starting Date, if the Participant so
elects, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:    (i) the date on which the first payment to be received by
the Participant is made (the  initial payment date ) shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early as the eighth day
after such notice is provided if (i) such notice clearly indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided under the Plan and
to elect (with spousal consent) an optional form of benefit, (ii) the Participant affirmatively elects a form of distribution with the consent of his or her spouse (if required) to commence as of the initial payment date, and (iii) the
Participant is permitted to revoke such election until the initial payment date;    (ii) the notice shall be provided to the
Participant no more than ninety (90) days before the initial payment date, however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)-day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;  
 (iii) the Participant is not permitted to elect a Pension Starting Date that precedes the date upon which the Participant could
have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in effect on the Pension Starting Date;    (iv) to
the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for the period from the Pension Starting Date to the initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up
payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the period beginning on the Pension Starting Date and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received
prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in the preceding sentence shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 8.1 (relating to
statutory limits), the limitations set forth therein shall comply with the adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with respect to any Pension Starting Date described in this paragraph which is a  retroactive
annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and  
      31  

(v) if a Participant who is married elects to commence the Participant s
benefit as of the initial payment date pursuant to this paragraph, then the Participant s spouse (including an alternate payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified domestic relations order), determined as of the
initial payment date, must consent to such election if the survivor benefits payable as of the Pension Starting Date are less than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in Option 3 of Section 7.2(b) of the Plan as of the
initial payment date.    (e)  Waiver of Statutory Surviving Spouse s Benefit . A Participant may waive the statutory surviving
spouse s benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2) at any time prior to the Participant s death, provided, however, that if such waiver is made prior to the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35, such waiver shall become
invalid on the first day of such year unless the Participant has terminated employment by the Employers prior to such day. A Participant whose waiver becomes invalid pursuant to the preceding sentence may elect, at any time after the waiver becomes
invalid, to again waive the statutory surviving spouse s benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2). A waiver made pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be made by delivering a written notice thereof to the Administrator on a form provided
by the Administrator for this purpose with a written consent of the Participant s Spouse which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section (relating to beneficiary designation) (unless it is determined pursuant to paragraph
(c) of this Section that such consent is not needed). Such a waiver shall cease to be effective if, subsequent to the execution of such waiver, the Participant shall make any other Beneficiary designation pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section (relating to beneficiary designation) which diminishes the rights or contingent rights of the Participant s Spouse, which are specified in the Beneficiary designation in effect at the time such Spouse consented to such waiver, to all or
part of the benefit provided under Section 7.3(b) (relating to form of payment of pre-retirement death benefits), provided, however, that in no event shall such  
      32  

other Beneficiary designation affect the effectiveness of such waiver if such Spouse shall have so specified at the time of consent. A waiver described in this paragraph shall cease to be
effective on (i) the date on which the Participant is subsequently married to a person other than the Spouse who consented to such waiver, (ii) the Participant s Pension Starting Date, or (iii) the date of the Participant s
revocation of such waiver.    (f)  Notice of Right to Waive Statutory Surviving Spouse s Benefit . Not later than twelve months
after the day on which an Employee has become a Participant, the Administrator shall give the Participant by mail or personal delivery written notice in nontechnical language that he or she may waive the statutory surviving spouse s benefit
provided by Section 7.3(b)(2). Such notice shall include a general description of terms and conditions of such benefit and the circumstances under which it will be provided unless waived and the Participant s right to revoke any such
waiver and general information on the relative financial effect, if any, upon the Participant s Pension of such benefit and its waiver. Such notice shall also advise the Participant that, upon written request to the Administrator prior to the
end of the waiver period set forth in paragraph (e) of this Section (relating to waiver of statutory surviving spouse s benefit), he or she will be given a written explanation in nontechnical language of the terms and conditions of such
benefit and the financial effect, in terms of dollars per payment, upon his or her other death benefits if he or she does not waive such benefit. Such explanation shall be mailed or personally delivered to the Participant within 30 days from the
date his or her written request is received by the Administrator.    (g)  Election of Optional Form of Statutory Surviving Spouse s
Benefit . A surviving Spouse may elect to have the statutory surviving spouse s benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2) payable in the form of Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) (relating to optional forms of distribution). Such an election
may be made at any time prior to the commencement of such benefit and not thereafter. Such an election shall be made by delivering a written notice thereof to the Administrator on a form provided by the Administrator for this purpose.  
      33  

(h)  Automatic Cancellation of Elections . If a Participant s Pension is payable in the
form of a joint and survivor annuity and if, prior to the Participant s Pension Starting Date, the Participant s Spouse dies or the Participant and such Spouse divorce, the Participant s election or deemed election to receive a joint
and survivor annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or divorce, be automatically cancelled, unless, subsequent to such Spouse s death or the Participant s divorce and prior to the
Participant s Pension Starting Date, the Participant remarries and notice of such new marriage is timely received by the Administrator.  
 Section 7.5  Distributions to Minor and Disabled Distributees . Any distribution under this Article that is payable to a distributee who
is a minor or to a distributee who, in the opinion of the Administrator, is unable to manage his or her affairs by reason of illness or mental incompetency may be made to or for the benefit of any such distributee at such time consistent with the
provisions of Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution) and in such of the following ways as the legal representative of such distributee shall direct: (i) directly to any such minor distributee if, in the opinion of such legal
representative, he or she is able to manage his or her affairs, (ii) to such legal representative, (iii) to a custodian under a Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for any such minor distributee, or (iv) directly in payment of expenses of
support or maintenance of such person. Neither the Administrator nor the Trustee shall be required to see to the application by any third party other than the legal representative of a distributee of any distribution made to or for the benefit of
such distributee pursuant to this Section.  
      34  

Section 7.6  Direct Rollover Distributions . In the case of a distribution under this Plan
that is an  eligible rollover distribution  within the meaning of section 402 of the Code and that is at least $200, an eligible distributee (as defined below) may elect that all or any portion of such distribution to which such eligible

established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person. For purposes of this Section,  eligible distributee  shall include the Participant, his or her spouse or his or her former spouse who is an alternate
payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code and, effective January 1, 2010, the Participant s Beneficiary who is not the Participant s spouse or former spouse. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an eligible distributee shall not be entitled to elect to have less than the total amount of such distribution transferred as a rollover contribution unless the amount to be transferred equals at least $500.

      36  

ARTICLE 8   
  LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS   
 Section 8.1  Statutory Limits . The provisions of this Section shall be effective for any  Limitation Year  (as defined below)

all other defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer or any other Affiliate does not exceed the lesser of:    (i)
$160,000 (as increased to reflect the cost of living adjustments provided under section 415(d) of the Code), multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of participation

(i) a condition set forth in subparagraph (b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) above is satisfied, (ii) the Participant is not in the Restricted Group, (iii) the Plan is terminated and the benefit received by the Participant is
nondiscriminatory or (iv) such restrictions are not required to be applied to such payment under the Code or Regulations.    Section
8.3  Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding . Effective January 1, 2010, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment
percentage is at or below the following levels.    (a)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan s Adjusted Funding Target Attainment
Percentage Is Less Than 80%, But Not Less Than 60% . If the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less than 80% (or would be less than 80% to the extent described in subparagraph (a)(2) below) but is not
less than 60%, then the limitations set forth in this paragraph (a) apply.    (1)  50% Limitation on Single Sum
Payments, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments . A Participant or Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a lump sum distribution or other optional form of distribution that includes a
prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, and the Plan shall not make any  
      41  

payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment, unless the present value of the portion of the
benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment does not exceed the lesser of:      

(i) 
 50% of the present value of the benefit payable in the optional form of benefit that includes the prohibited payment; or        

(ii) 
 100% of the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount (as defined in Treasury Regulation section  1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(C)).     
 The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (a)(1) does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under section 411(a)(11)
of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant. If an optional form of benefit that is otherwise available under the terms of the Plan is not available to a Participant or Beneficiary as of the annuity starting
date because of the application of the requirements of this subparagraph (a)(1), the Participant or Beneficiary is permitted to elect to bifurcate the benefit into unrestricted and restricted portions (as described in Treasury Regulation section
1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D)). The Participant or Beneficiary may also elect any other optional form of benefit otherwise available under the Plan at that annuity starting date that would satisfy the 50% limitation described in subparagraph (a)(1)(i) above
or the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount described in subparagraph (a)(1)(ii) above, or may elect to defer the benefit in accordance with any general right to defer commencement of benefits under the Plan.  
      42  

(2)  Plan Amendments Increasing Liability for Benefits . No amendment to the
Plan that has the effect of increasing liabilities of the Plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect in
a Plan Year if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:      

(ii) 
 80% or more, but would be less than 80% if the benefits attributable to the amendment were taken into account in determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.    
 The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (a)(2) does not apply to any amendment to the Plan that provides a benefit
increase under a Plan formula that is not based on compensation, provided that the rate of such increase does not exceed the contemporaneous rate of increase in the average wages of Participants covered by the amendment.  
 (b)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan s Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage Is Less Than 60% . If the Plan s
adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less than 60% (or would be less than 60% to the extent described in subparagraph (b)(2) below), then the limitations in this paragraph (b) apply.  
 (1)  Single Sums, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments Not Permitted . A Participant or
Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, and
the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment. The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (b)(1) does not apply to
any payment of a benefit which under section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.  
      43  

(2)  Shutdown Benefits and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits Not
Permitted to Be Paid . An unpredictable contingent event benefit with respect to an unpredictable contingent event occurring during a Plan Year shall not be paid if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:  

(ii) 
 60% or more, but would be less than 60% if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage were redetermined applying an actuarial assumption that the likelihood of occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event
during the Plan Year is 100%.      (3)  Benefit Accruals Frozen . Benefit accruals under the Plan shall
cease as of the applicable section 436 measurement date. In addition, if the Plan is required to cease benefit accruals under this subparagraph (b)(3), then the Plan is not permitted to be amended in a manner that would increase the liabilities of
the Plan by reason of an increase in benefits or establishment of new benefits.    (c)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan Sponsor Is In
Bankruptcy . Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, a Participant or Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment with an
annuity starting date that occurs during any period in which the Plan sponsor is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or state law, except for payments made within a Plan Year with an annuity starting date that
occurs on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment  
      44  

percentage for that Plan Year is not less than 100%. In addition, during such period in which the Plan sponsor is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or
state law, the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment, except for payments that occur on a date within a Plan Year
that is on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that Plan Year is not less than 100%. The limitation set forth in this paragraph (c) does
not apply to any payment of a benefit which under section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.  
 (d)  Provisions Applicable After Limitations Cease to Apply .  
 (1)  Resumption of Prohibited Payments . If a limitation on prohibited payments under subparagraph (a)(1), (b)(1), or
(c) of this Section applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limit no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefits with annuity starting dates
that are on or after that later section 436 measurement date.    (2)  Resumption of Benefit Accruals . If a limitation
on benefit accruals under subparagraph (b)(3) of this Section applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limitation no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then benefit accruals shall resume
prospectively and that limitation does not apply to benefit accruals that are based on service on or after that later section 436 measurement date, except as otherwise provided under the Plan. The Plan shall comply with the rules relating to partial
years of participation and the prohibition on double proration under Department of Labor Regulation section 2530.204-2(c) and (d).  
      45  

(3)  Shutdown and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits . If an
unpredictable contingent event benefit with respect to an unpredictable contingent event that occurs during the Plan Year is not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the event because of the limitation of subparagraph (b)(2) of this Section,
but is permitted to be paid later in the same Plan Year (as a result of additional contributions or pursuant to the enrolled actuary s certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(B)), then that unpredictable contingent event benefit shall be paid, retroactive to the period that benefit would have been payable under the terms of the Plan (determined without regard
to subparagraph (b)(2) of this Section). If the unpredictable contingent event benefit does not become payable during the Plan Year in accordance with the preceding sentence, then the Plan is treated as if it does not provide for that benefit.  
 (4)  Treatment of Plan Amendments That Do Not Take Effect . If a Plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective
date of the amendment because of the limitation of subparagraph (a)(2) or (b)(3) of this Section, but is permitted to take effect later in the same Plan Year (as a result of additional contributions or pursuant to the enrolled actuary s
certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(C)), then the Plan amendment must automatically take effect as of the first day of the
Plan Year (or, if later, the original effective date of the amendment). If the Plan amendment cannot take effect during the same Plan Year, then it shall be treated as if it were never adopted, unless the Plan amendment provides otherwise.  
      46  

(e)  Notice Requirement . Written notice to Participants and Beneficiaries shall be provided
within 30 days, in accordance with section 101(j) of ERISA, if the Plan becomes subject to a limitation described in subparagraph (a)(1), (b), or (c) of this Section.  
 (f)  Methods to Avoid or Terminate Benefit Limitations . Application of one or more of the benefit limitations set forth in paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section for a Plan Year may be avoided or terminated through the use of employer contributions, by increasing the amount of Plan assets which are taken into account in determining the adjusted funding target
attainment percentage and by other methods in accordance with sections 436(b)(2), (c)(2), (e)(2) and (f) of the Code and Treasury Regulation section  1.436-1(f).

her rehire date if he or she is then an Eligible Employee or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his or her employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant.
Notwithstanding clause (1) of the preceding sentence, if an Employee described in the preceding sentence who first became an employed by an Employer prior to January 1, 2001 was not at any time permitted to make the election described in

Employee s Termination of Employment, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan  
      51  

as of his or her rehire date or (2) participate in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as applicable, at the time prescribed therein and have his or her accrued benefit under the ComEd Plan or

the Plan under Article 3 (relating to eligibility), measuring such individual s years of Vesting Service for purposes of the Vesting Requirement and determining when such individual s Termination of Employment occurs for purposes of
Article 7 (relating to distributions) to the same extent such period would have been taken into account had such employment been with an Employer.

determining whether such individual qualifies as an Eligible Employee under subdivision (16) of Article 2.    Section 9.5  Employees
who Become Eligible Employees as a Result of Ceasing to be Represented by IBEW Local Union 15 . If an Employee who, on the day he or she first performed an Hour of Service with an Employer, was a member of a collective bargaining unit represented

      56  

Union 15 and shall have his or her accrued benefit under the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees and related assets transferred to the Plan. If an Employee who, on the

 Section 9.7  Change in Employment Status or Transfer to Affiliate . Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.8 and elsewhere in the
Plan, if an Employee who was a Participant transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to
participate in the Plan but are instead either eligible to participate in another plan maintained by such Employer or Affiliate or are not eligible to participate in any plan, then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment participate
in the plan, if any, determined pursuant to rules established by the Company, which rules may be set forth in a Supplement hereto.  
      57  

Section 9.8  Transfer of Employment to or from Facilities formerly Owned by CEG . Effective
as of the Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), if a Participant who was a Participant on or prior to the Effective Time transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with
respect to which similarly situated employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in the Plan but are instead eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) that is
intended to be a defined benefit pension plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each such plan, a  CEG Pension Plan ) , then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment remain a Participant in the Plan and shall
not participate in the CEG Pension Plan. If a participant in the CEG Pension Plan who was a participant in such plan on or prior to the Effective Time transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification

  ARTICLE 15      AMENDMENT,
ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATE      PLAN AND TERMINATION   
 Section 15.1  Amendment . The board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) may at any time and from time to time amend or
modify this Plan in any manner deemed by the board of directors of the Company to be necessary or desirable, provided, however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of
more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in
annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater. Any such amendment or modification shall become effective on such date as the board (or committee thereof) or
executive shall determine and may apply to Participants in this Plan at the time thereof as well as to future Participants, provided, however, that, unless permitted by applicable law, no such amendment or modification which reduces the basis for
the computation of Pensions shall be retroactive as to service prior to the date of such amendment or modification.  
      78  

Section 15.2  Establishment of Separate Plan . If an Employer shall withdraw from this Plan
under Section 11.2 (relating to withdrawal from participation), the Investment Office shall determine the portion of the Trust Fund held by the Trustee which is applicable to the Participants of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate
such portion in a separate trust. Such separate trust shall thereafter be held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.  
 Section 15.3  Termination of the Plan by an Employer . The Company may at any time, by resolution adopted by its board of directors,
terminate this Plan in its entirety. In addition, any Employer may at any time terminate its participation in this Plan by resolution adopted by its board of directors to that effect. Contributions of an Employer to the Plan are conditioned on the
receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of an initial favorable determination letter that this Plan and the Trust Fund as adopted by the Company meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt from tax under
section 501(a) of the Code, and if the Internal Revenue Service shall refuse to issue such letter, any Employer may terminate its participation in this Plan and direct the Trustee to pay and deliver to that Employer the portion of the Trust Fund
applicable to its contributions.    Section 15.4  Vesting and Distribution Upon Termination or Partial Termination . Upon termination
or partial termination of the Plan, the benefit as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case may be, of all affected Participants shall be fully vested; provided, however, that full vesting shall be required with respect to a
termination or partial termination only to the extent the Plan is then funded.    Allocation and distribution of the terminated portion of
the Trust Fund shall thereafter be made in accordance with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and with any applicable approval of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the  PBGC ). If the
 
      79  

Administrator is notified by PBGC that PBGC is unable to determine that the Trust Fund is sufficient to discharge when due all obligations of the Plan with respect to benefits guaranteed by PBGC
pursuant to section 4022 of ERISA, then the allocation and distribution of such portion of the Trust Fund shall be made only under the direction of PBGC or a United States district court pursuant to section 4044 of ERISA.  
 In the event that, after the termination of the Plan, any assets remain after such allocation, such assets shall be paid to the Company. The
portion of the assets allocated to provide benefits to any person or group of persons may be applied for the benefit of such person or persons by the distribution of cash, continuance of the Trust Fund, establishment of a new Trust Fund, purchase of
annuities from an insurance company, or otherwise, as determined by the Investment Office in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the benefit of any Participant or former Participant who is married and has satisfied the Vesting Requirement
shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth in Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants) and, if the surviving Spouse of a deceased Participant or deceased former
Participant is entitled to receive a benefit pursuant to Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants) or Section 7.3 (relating to pre-retirement death benefits), as the case may be, such benefit
shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth therein.    Contributions of an Employer to the Plan are
conditioned on the receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of an initial favorable determination letter that the Plan and Trust Fund as adopted by the Company meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt
from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and, in the event that the Internal Revenue Service shall refuse to issue such letter, the Company may terminate the Plan and shall direct the Trustee to pay and deliver the Trust Fund to the Company.  
      80  

Section 15.5  Trust Fund to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their
Beneficiaries . Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.2 (relating to limitation on contributions) and 15.4 (relating to vesting and distribution upon termination or partial termination), and any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their beneficiaries and the payment of expenses in accordance with
Section 13.1 (relating to expenses) either by operation or termination of the Plan, power of amendment or otherwise.  
      81  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized
officer on this                day of December, 2013.

 SPECIAL RULES REGARDING COMPUTATION OF BENEFIT        

A. 
  Factors to Calculate Pension Paid Before Schedule A Normal Retirement Age         

1. 
  Pension Starting Date on or After Early Retirement Date and Prior to Schedule A Normal Retirement Age . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Termination of Employment
occurs on or after his or her Early Retirement Date and whose Pension commences prior to his or her Schedule A Normal Retirement Age shall be computed by multiplying such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor from Table
B-1.        

2. 
  Pension Starting Date After Attainment of Age 60 but Prior to Early Retirement Date . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs on or after such
Participant s attainment of age 60 but prior to such Participant s attainment of his or her Early Retirement Date shall be such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit without any actuarial reduction.    

3. 
  Pension Starting Date After Completion of Ten Years of Credited Service but Prior to Attainment of Age 60 . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date
occurs prior to such Participant s attainment of age 60 and prior to his or her attainment of his or her Early Retirement Date, but after the Participant has completed at least ten years of Credited Service, shall be (a) if the
Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs on or after his or her attainment of age 50, the amount determined by multiplying such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor in Table F and (b) if the
Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs prior to his or her attainment of age 50, the amount determined by actuarially reducing the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit using the factors in Table F to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit
from age 60 to age 50 and using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit to the Participant s Pension Starting Date.        

4. 
  Pension Starting Date Prior to Attainment of Age 60 and Prior to Completion of Ten Years of Credited Service . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date
occurs prior to such Participant s attainment of age 60 and prior to such Participant s completion of ten years of Credited Service shall be computed by reducing the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by using the Schedule A
Actuarial Factors to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit to the Pension Starting Date.        

B. 
  Distribution with Respect to Married Participants . Notwithstanding Section 7.2(b) of the Plan, if a Participant will receive his or her Accrued Benefit in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity,
the payments attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be calculated and paid as follows:        

1. 
    Pension Starting Date After Attainment of Age 50 . Annuity payments will be made during the Participant s lifetime in an amount equal to
the annual Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single     
      3  

life annuity for the Participant s lifetime reduced by the product of (i) 50% of the annual amount of Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the
Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime multiplied by (ii) 40% of the applicable factor set forth in Table D.    
 Thereafter, if the Participant s Spouse shall survive the Participant, such Spouse shall receive during the remainder of the
Spouse s lifetime an annual amount, payable monthly, equal to 50% of the annual amount the Participant would have received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable as a single life annuity for the Participant s
lifetime.    If the Participant survives the Spouse, such Participant shall receive during the remainder of the Participant s lifetime
an annual amount payable monthly equal to the annual amount the Participant would have received if the Participant s Frozen Benefit were payable as a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime.  

2.   
  Pension Starting Date Prior to Attainment of Age 50 . Annuity payments will be made during the Participant s lifetime in an amount equal to the annual Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have
received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime multiplied by (i) an applicable factor determined by using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors.
     Thereafter, if the Participant s Spouse shall survive the Participant, such Spouse shall receive during the remainder
of the Spouse s lifetime an annual amount, payable monthly, equal to 50% of the annuity payment prior to the Participant s death.  
 If the Participant survives the Spouse, the monthly annuity will continue to be paid without any further adjustments during the remainder of
the Participant s lifetime.      

C. 
  Post Retirement Adjustments . If a Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs on or after his or her 50 th  birthday and the Participant s Accrued
Frozen Benefit is paid in a form other than a lump sum distribution, the annual Accrued Frozen Benefit payable pursuant to this Schedule shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph C., be adjusted each October 1 for the
twelve-month period then beginning by adding a post-retirement cost of living adjustment computed by applying an adjustment percentage to the appropriate base specified in this paragraph C. A Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs prior to
his or her 50 th  birthday or who receives his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a lump sum distribution shall not be entitled to any post-retirement cost of living adjustment under this
Schedule. In addition, the post-retirement cost of living adjustment shall apply only to the portion of a Participant s Accrued Benefit that is attributable to his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit.    
      4  

1. 
 The adjustment percentage shall equal, for each October 1, the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the July immediately preceding such October 1 exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the July
immediately preceding the twelve-month period beginning October 1 in which the Participant terminated employment or payment of a Pension commenced; provided, however, that:    
 (a) If, as of such October 1, there shall be no such excess, the adjustment percentage shall be deemed to be zero for the twelve-month
period beginning on such October 1.    (b) There shall be no negative adjustment percentage.  
 (c) The aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning October 1 shall never be lower than the aggregate
adjustment percentage for the preceding such period.    (d) If the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index computed for the
twelve-month period beginning on October 1 does not exceed the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period by at least three percentage points, the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period
shall continue in effect during such twelve-month period beginning on October 1.    (e) The aggregate adjustment percentage for any
twelve-month period beginning on October 1 shall not be more than seven percentage points greater than that for the preceding twelve-month period. If the aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning on October 1
exceeds by more than seven percentage points the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period, the excess shall be carried over to succeeding twelve-month periods until such excess is reduced to zero.  
 (f) The adjustment percentage for the twelve-month period beginning with the October 1 next following the date the Participant s
Pension Starting Date shall be the adjustment percentage determined in accordance with the preceding provisions of this paragraph C. multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of full calendar months between such date and
such October 1 and the denominator of which shall be twelve.      

2. 
   To determine the amount of the monthly cost of living adjustment, the adjustment percentage shall be applied to the first $500 per month of a
Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment of $500 or, if the monthly amount of such Accrued Frozen Benefit is less than $500 per month, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment equal to the monthly Accrued
Frozen Benefit payment. To     
      5  

determine the amount of the adjustment made in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or surviving Spouse annuity payable pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Plan to the surviving
Spouse of a deceased Participant, a family pension payable pursuant to Section 4.B. of this Schedule to a surviving Dependent Minor Child or Children of a deceased Participant or a surviving dependent s pension payable pursuant to
Section 4.C. of this Schedule to a surviving Dependent Disabled Child or Children of a deceased Participant, the adjustment percentage shall be applied to the first $250 per month of such annuity or pension, subject to a maximum monthly
adjustment of $175 ($250 in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity) or, if the monthly amount of such annuity or pension is less than $175 ($250 in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity), subject to a maximum monthly
adjustment equal to the monthly Accrued Frozen Benefit payment.        

D. 
  Lump Sum Value . If a Participant elects to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a lump sum distribution as described in Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) of the Plan, the amount of the lump sum
attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be the greater of:        

1. 
 the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit determined using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors, and    

2. 
 an amount equal to the present value of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit determined as of December 31, 2001 using a 6.5% discount rate and the 1983 Group Annuity (unisex) Mortality Table (50% male, 50%
female), assuming the Accrued Frozen Benefit otherwise payable at the Schedule A Normal Retirement Age would commence at the later of the Participant s attained age at December 31, 2001 or age 60 and credited with 6.5% interest for each
Plan Year subsequent to December 31, 2001 during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year.    
 With respect to a Participant s lump sum value determined under subparagraph 1. above, if the Participant s Pension Starting Date
occurs on or after his or her 50 th  birthday, the actuarial equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall reflect the post retirement adjustments, if any, defined in Paragraph
3.C of this Schedule.      

4. 
 OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFIT PAYABLE UPON RETIREMENT      In lieu of the forms of benefit available under
Section 7.2 of the Plan, a Participant may elect to have the portion of his or her Accrued Benefit attributable to his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit paid in the following forms, subject to Section 7.4 (relating to election and waiver
procedures):      

A. 
    Optional Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity : A Participant who is married on the Participant s Pension Starting Date may elect to
receive a Qualified Joint and     
      6  

Survivor Annuity described in Section 7.2(b) of the Plan (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants) with the portion of the Pension payable to the
Participant s Spouse that is attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit of a percentage less than 50 of the Pension the Participant would have received if the Participant s Pension attributable to his or her Accrued
Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single-life annuity for the Participant s lifetime. A Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity described in this paragraph shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner as described in
Section 7.2(b) of the Plan (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participant) and shall be computed in the same manner as described in Section 3.B. of this Schedule (relating to special rules regarding computation of
benefits), except that the lesser percentage of Pension designated by the Participant shall be used.        

B. 
  Family Pension : A Participant who is not married on the Participant s Pension Starting Date and who, as of such date, has a Dependent Minor Child or Dependent Minor Children may elect to receive his or her
Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a family pension payable in monthly payments for the Participant s lifetime and, thereafter, payable in monthly payments in equal shares to each of the Participant s Dependent Minor Children who have
not yet attained age 21. The annual amount of the family pension payable to the Participant shall be the annual Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the Participant s Pension were payable in the form of a single life
annuity for the Participant s lifetime, reduced by the product of (1) the annual amount of the family pension designated by the Participant for the Participant s surviving Dependent Minor Child or Children which amount shall be a
percentage, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Participant s Pension payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime multiplied by (2) (i) if the Participant is at least age 50 on his or her
Pension Starting Date, the applicable factor set forth in Table E or (ii) if the Participant is not at least age 50 on his or her Pension Starting Date, the applicable factor determined by using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors. The annual
amount of the family pension payable after the Participant s death to the Participant s Dependent Minor Child or Children who have not yet attained age 21 shall equal the percentage designated by the Participant, not to exceed 50, of the
annual amount of the Pension the Participant would have received if the Participant s Pension were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime.    

C. 
    Surviving Dependent s Pension : A Participant who is not married on the Participant s Pension Starting Date and who, as of such date,
has a Dependent Disabled Child or Dependent Disabled Children may elect to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a surviving dependent s pension payable in monthly payments for the Participant s lifetime and, thereafter,
payable in monthly payments in equal shares to each of the Participant s Dependent Disabled Children who remain disabled. The annual amount of the surviving dependent s pension payable to the Participant shall be the annual Accrued Frozen
Benefit the Participant would have received if the Participant s Pension were payable in the     
      7  

form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime, reduced by the product of (1) the annual amount of the surviving dependent s pension designated by the Participant for
the Participant s Dependent Disabled Child or Children, which amount shall be a percentage, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Participant s Pension payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s
lifetime multiplied by (2) (i) if the Participant is at least age 50 on his or her Pension Starting Date, 50% of the applicable factor set forth in Table D, such factor to be determined based on the age of the other parent of such Child or
Children, at the Participant s Pension Starting Date or the age such other parent would have attained had such other parent survived or if, in either case, the age of such other parent cannot be determined, the age of the Participant or
(ii) if the Participant is not at least age 50 on his or her Pension Starting Date, the applicable factor determined by using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors. The annual amount of the surviving dependent s pension payable after the
Participant s death to the Participant s Dependent Disabled Child or Children who remain disabled shall equal the percentage designated by the Participant, not to exceed 50, of the annual amount of the Pension the Participant would have
received if the Participant s Pension were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime.        

D. 
  75% Marital Annuity : A Participant who is married on the Participant s Annuity Starting Date may elect to receive a 75% marital annuity with a Service Annuity payable to the Participant s Spouse, if the
Participant predeceases such Spouse, of a percentage equal to 75 of the Service Annuity the Participant would have received under Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) if the Participant s Service Annuity were payable in semi-monthly
payments for the Participant s lifetime. A 75% marital annuity described in this Section 6.2 shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner as described in paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 (relating to annuities payable to
married Participants) and shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Service Annuity the Participant would have received under Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities), determined by using the annual interest rate specified under section 417(e) of
the Code for the November preceding the calendar year in which such distribution is made or commences, and the mortality table prescribed for purposes of section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Code.

 SPECIAL RULES REGARDING COMPUTATION OF BENEFIT        

A. 
  Factors to Calculate Pension Paid Before Schedule B Normal Retirement Age         

1. 
  Pension Starting Date on or After Early Retirement Date and Prior to Schedule B Normal Retirement Age . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Termination of Employment
occurs on or after his or her Early Retirement Date and whose Pension commences prior to his or her Schedule B Normal Retirement Age shall be computed by multiplying such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor from Table
B-1.        

2. 
  Pension Starting Date After Attainment of Age 50 but Prior to Early Retirement Date . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs on or after such
Participant s attainment of age 50 but prior to such Participant s attainment of his or her Early Retirement Date and whose Pension commences prior to his or her Schedule B Normal Retirement Age shall be computed by multiplying such
Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor from Table G.        

3. 
  Pension Starting Date Prior to Attainment of Age 50 . The amount determined by actuarially reducing the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit using the factors in Table G to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit
from age 65 to age 50 and using the Schedule B Actuarial Factors to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit from age 50 to the Participant s Pension Starting Date.    
      2  

B.  Lump Sum Value . If a Participant elects to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in
the form of a lump sum distribution as described in Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) of the Plan, the amount of the lump sum attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be the greater of:  

1. 
 the actuarial equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit using the Schedule B Actuarial Factors, and        

2. 
 an amount equal to the present value of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit determined as of December 31, 2001 using a 6.5% discount rate and the 1983 Group Annuity (unisex) Mortality Table (50% male, 50%
female), assuming the Accrued Frozen Benefit otherwise payable at the Schedule B Normal Retirement Age would commence at the later of the Participant s attained age at December 31, 2001 or age 60 (or, effective January 1, 2002, age 59
for Craft, Craft/Technical, Technical Support and Professional Support Employees with an Accrued Frozen Benefit) and credited with 6.5% for each Plan Year subsequent to December 31, 2001 during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or
not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year.        

4. 
 OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFIT PAYABLE UPON RETIREMENT      In lieu of the optional forms of benefit available under
Section 7.2(c) of the Plan, a Participant may elect to have the portion of his or her Accrued Benefit attributable to his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit paid in the following form, subject to Section 7.4 (relating to election and waiver
procedures):      

A. 
    Contingent Annuity Option : A Participant (each, an  Eligible Participant ) who has a Termination of Employment after he or she
(1) has completed at least 14 Benefit Years, or (2) has attained age 65 and has completed at least 5 Benefit Years, or (3) has attained his or her Early Retirement Date may elect a contingent annuity option under which the Participant
may designate a percentage equal to 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of his or her Pension to be paid upon his or her death to a contingent Beneficiary designated by such Participant. The annuity otherwise payable to a Participant electing a Contingent Annuity
Option or to his or her contingent Beneficiary will be actuarially reduced using the Schedule B Actuarial Factors to reflect the payments which may become payable to the Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Participant s
Spouse is designated as the contingent Beneficiary, the actuarial reduction will not reflect the cost of a joint and survivor annuity option providing a survivor annuity to the Participant s Spouse of
    
      3  

(1) 50% of the amount payable to the Participant, if a 50%, 75% or 100% contingent annuity option is elected, or (2) 25% of the amount payable to the Participant, if a 25% contingent annuity
option is elected; provided, however, that the subsidy described in this sentence shall not apply to a former spouse who is to be treated as a Participant s spouse pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, unless the qualified domestic
relations order specifically provides that such subsidy applies to the former spouse. If the contingent Beneficiary is other than the Spouse, the percentage payable to the contingent Beneficiary after the Participant s death may not exceed the
applicable percentage from Appendix B. The contingent annuity option of an electing Participant who has a Termination of Employment before he or she attains his or her Early Retirement Date shall be canceled.

      C-2  

B. 
  Lump Sum Value . If a Participant elects to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a lump sum distribution as described in Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) of the Plan, the amount of the lump sum
attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be the greater of:

(unisex) Mortality Table (50% male, 50% female). assuming the Accrued Frozen Benefit otherwise payable at the Schedule C Normal Retirement Age would commence at the later of the Participant s attained age as of the date the Participant became a
Participant in the Plan or age 62.        

4. 
 OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFIT PAYABLE UPON RETIREMENT      In lieu of the forms of benefit available under
Section 7.2 of the Plan, a Participant may elect to have the portion of his or her Accrued Benefit attributable to his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit paid in the following forms, subject to Section 7.4 (relating to election and waiver
procedures):      

A. 
  Ten- Year Certain Option : A Participant may elect to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a reduced amount which is the Actuarial Equivalent, determined using the Schedule C Actuarial
Assumptions, of his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit during his or her lifetime and, in the event of the Participant s death prior to the expiration of ten years following his or her Pension Starting Date, such Accrued Frozen Benefit shall
continue for any unexpired portion of such ten-year period to his designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. Subject to Section 7.4, the Participant shall have the right to change or redesignate his or her Beneficiary or successive Beneficiaries
at any time prior to the expiration of the ten-year period described above. If the Beneficiary or successive Beneficiaries shall survive the retired Participant but die prior to the expiration of the ten-year period described above, the commuted
value of the remaining payments due the Beneficiaries shall be paid to the estate of such Beneficiaries. If the Participant shall die within the ten-year period described above without any surviving designated Beneficiary, the commuted value of the
payments which would otherwise have been paid during the remaining portion of said ten-year period shall be paid by the Trustee at the direction of the Administrator (i) to the surviving Spouse of such deceased Participant, if any, or
(ii) if there shall be no surviving Spouse, to the surviving children of such deceased Participant, if any, in equal shares, or (iii) if there shall be no surviving Spouse or surviving children, to the executor or administrator of the
estate of such deceased Participant, or (iv) if no executor or administrator shall have been appointed for the estate of such deceased Participant within six months following the date of the Participant s death, in equal shares to the
person or persons who would be entitled under the intestate succession laws of the state of the Participant s domicile to receive the Participant s personal estate.    
      C-3  

B. 
  Social Security Adjustment Option : A Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs after his or her Earlier Than Normal Retirement Date and prior to his or her attainment of age 62 may elect, at any time prior
to his or Earlier Than Normal Retirement Date, to have the amount of his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit increased during the period prior to becoming eligible to receive monthly benefits under the Social Security Act, and decreased during the period
after becoming eligible to receive monthly benefits under the Social Security Act, so as to provide for the Participant an essentially uniform total retirement benefit composed of his Accrued Frozen Benefit and monthly benefits under the Social
Security Act. For purposes of this optional form of benefit, the monthly benefits under the Social Security Act shall mean the old age insurance benefit that a Participant might be entitled to receive at the earliest age the Participant will be
eligible to begin receiving monthly benefit under the Social Security Act as of the date he or she elects this optional form of benefit and the Accrued Frozen Benefit shall not be adjusted because of any subsequent change in the actual monthly
benefits received under the Social Security Act. If the Participant elects the Social Security Adjustment Option, his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be the greater of (i) the Accrued Frozen Benefit reduced as described in Paragraph 3.A.2
of this Schedule C and applying the Schedule C Actuarial Assumptions for computing monthly benefit payments; and (ii) the Accrued Frozen Benefit actuarially reduced to the Participant s age at retirement and converted to the Social

fully vested, and (ii) remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date or, if earlier, the option expiration date, provided that this Section 4.3 shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options
in connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.        

4.4. 
  Other Awards . Awards of Performance Shares, Restricted Stock (as defined in Sections 5.1(c) and 5.1(d), respectively) and/or Cash Performance Awards, as applicable, shall be payable to a Participant solely to the

attained at least age 50 and completed at least 10 years of service (or who has completed such other age and service requirement then in effect under the Exelon Corporation Severance Benefit Plan or any successor plan as of the relevant time set
forth in such plan) under the terms of the Pension Plan (or who, pursuant to the terms of an offer of employment or employment agreement or under any provision of the Pension Plan or SERP, is credited with a number of additional years of age and/or
service that would enable such Participant to satisfy the above eligibility requirements) shall be entitled to elect such Company group health care programs for retirees as are in effect as of the Termination Date and are applicable to such
Participant by the programs  eligibility terms and conditions as though such Participant had attained such programs  age and service requirements. The eligibility for coverage and availability of programs or plans, the amounts charged for
coverage, and the other terms, conditions and limitations under the Company s group health care programs or plans shall remain subject to the Company s right to amend, change or terminate such programs or plans at any time.

4.6. 
  SERP / Other Deferred Compensation . For purposes of the Participant s SERP benefit, the Salary Continuation Period shall be taken into account as service solely for purposes of determining whether the
Participant is vested (i.e., 3 or 5 years of service) and, to the extent relevant under the Pension Plan covering the Participant, the amount of the Participant s regular accrued benefit, but not for purposes of determining eligibility for
early retirement benefits (including any social security supplement) or any other purpose. In determining the amount of the Participant s vested benefit, if any, the severance payments made under Section 4.1 shall be taken into account as
if such payments were normal base salary and incentive payments. Payment shall be made in accordance with the SERP and the Participant s distribution election in effect thereunder as of the Termination Date (or, if no affirmative election is in
effect as of such date, the default election applicable to the Participant). All amounts previously deferred by, or accrued to the benefit of, such Participant under the Exelon Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, the Exelon Corporation Stock

circumstance, make all factual and legal determinations, construe uncertain or disputed terms and make eligibility and benefit determinations in such manner and to such extent as the Plan Administrator, in his or her sole discretion may determine.
Benefits under the Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator, in his or her discretion, determines that an individual is entitled to them; provided, however, that any dispute after the claims procedure under Section 10 has been exhausted
regarding whether an Executive s termination of employment for purposes of Section 5 is based on either Good Reason or Cause may, at the election of the Executive, be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 11.  
 The Plan Administrator may promulgate any rules and regulations it deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the Plan or to interpret the
terms and conditions of the Plan; provided, however, that no rule, regulation or interpretation shall be contrary to the provisions of the Plan. The rules, regulations and interpretations made by the Plan Administrator shall, where appropriate, be
applied on a consistent basis with respect to similarly situated Executives, and shall be final and binding on any Executive or former Executive and any successor in interest.  
 The Plan Administrator may delegate any administrative duties, including, without limitation, duties with respect to the processing, review,
investigation, approval and payment of severance pay and provision of severance benefits, to designated individuals or committees. The Plan Administrator may amend any Participant s Severance Agreement to the extent the Plan Administrator
determines it is reasonably necessary or appropriate to do so to comply with section 409A of the Code.      
   The Plan Administrator shall determine the status of an
individual as an Executive and the eligibility and rights of any Executive or former Executive as a Participant to any severance pay or benefits hereunder. Any Executive or former Executive who believes that he or she is entitled to receive
severance pay or benefits under the Plan, including severance pay or benefits other than those initially determined by the Plan Administrator, may file a claim in writing with the Plan Administrator. Within 90 days after the receipt of the claim the
Plan Administrator shall either allow or deny the claim in writing, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days after
receipt of a request for review.    A claimant whose claim is denied (or his or her duly authorized representative) may, within 60 days
after receipt of the denial of his or her claim, request a review upon written application to Exelon s Chief Human Resources Officer or other officer designated by Exelon and specified in the claim denial; review (without charge) relevant
documents; and submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim.  
      26  

The Chief Human Resources Officer or other designated officer shall notify the claimant of his or
her decision on review within 60 days after receipt of a request for review unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days
after receipt of a request for review. Notice of the decision on review shall be in writing. The officer s decision on review shall be final and binding on any claimant or any successor in interest.  
 In reviewing a claim or an appeal of a claim denial, the Plan Administrator and the Chief Human Resources Officer or other designated by
Exelon shall have all of the powers and authority granted to the Plan Administrator pursuant to Section 9.      
   Any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto
concerning whether an Executive s termination of employment for purposes of Section 5 is based on either Good Reason or Cause may, after the claims procedure under Section 10 has been exhausted and at the election of the Executive, be
settled by binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, before an impartial arbitrator pursuant to the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association (  AAA  ) pertaining to the arbitration of employee benefit plan
disputes. The costs and fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, regardless of the result of the arbitration. No arbitration shall be commenced after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based upon such
subject matter would be barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Plan, any party may seek relief in the form of specific performance, injunctive or
other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrator, and the Company may seek injunctive relief to enforce the above-referenced statutes of limitations.

   AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN        Exelon s Chief Human Resources Officer or
another designated officer of the Company may amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time by written instrument; provided, however, that no amendment, modification or termination shall deprive any Participant of any payment or benefit that the
Plan Administrator previously has determined is payable under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or termination that reduces the severance payments or materially adversely affects any Participant s other benefits under
Section 5 shall become effective as to such Participant during: (a) the 24-month period following a Change Date or (b) during an Imminent Control Change Period (unless such Participant consents to such termination or amendment). Any
purported Plan termination or amendment in violation of this Section 12 shall be void and of no effect.

defense.        

13.4.

this Plan, all amounts payable pursuant to this Plan shall be paid without reduction regardless of any amounts of salary, compensation or other amounts which may be paid or payable to the Executive as the result of the Executive s employment by
another, unaffiliated employer.        

13.5.  
  Headings . Headings of sections in this document are for convenience only, and do not constitute any part of the Plan.        

13.6.  
  Severability . If any one or more Sections, subsections or other portions of this Plan are declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve
to invalidate any Section, subsection or other portion not so declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section, subsection or other portion so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall be construed so as to effectuate the terms of such Section,
subsection or other portion to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a determination is made that the Restrictive Covenants are invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then
the Severance Agreement with respect to the Participant subject to such determination shall be void and the Company shall have no obligation to provide benefits under this Plan to such Participant.

time for any reason or for no reason.        

13.9.  
    Successors and Assigns . This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Exelon and its successors and assigns and shall be binding

Release), the severance pay described in Sections 4.1, 5.1, or 5.2, as applicable, shall be paid to his or her estate, and the Participant s dependents who are covered under any health care plans maintained by the Company shall be entitled
to continued rights under Section 4.5 or Section 5.1(e) or Section 5.2(g), as applicable; provided that the estate or other successor of the Participant has not revoked such Waiver and Release.

law and may report all such amounts payable to such authority in accordance with any applicable law or regulation.        

13.13. 
     Section 409A . This Plan shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of additional taxes and penalties
under Section 409A of the Code ( 409A Penalties ). In the event the terms of this Plan would subject a Participant to 409A Penalties, the Company may amend the terms of the Plan to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible.
The payments to a Participant pursuant to this Plan are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible, under either the separation pay exemption pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or
as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(4), and for purposes of the separation pay exemption, each installment paid to a Participant shall be considered a separate payment. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Plan, if on the date of a Participant s Termination Date the Participant is a Specified Employee, then to the extent any amount payable under this Plan constitutes the payment of
    
      29  

nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that under the terms of this Plan would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the Termination
Date, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date or (B) the date of the Participant s death. Any reimbursement (including any advancement) payable to a Participant
pursuant to this Plan shall be conditioned on the submission by the Participant of all expense reports reasonably required by the Company under any applicable expense reimbursement policy, and shall be paid to the Participant within 30 days
following receipt of such expense reports (or invoices), but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant incurred the reimbursable expense. Any amount of expenses eligible for

ARTICLE III Pension Payments  
 3.1(a)  Form of Pension Payments: Traditional Pension Plan  Except as provided in 3.3(h), all pension payments to Participants in the
Traditional Pension Plan are paid in monthly installments.    3.1(b)  Form of Pension Payments: PEP  Except as provided in 3.3(h),
all pension payments to Participants in PEP are paid in monthly installments unless the Participant elects, within 60 days of the Participant s Severance From Service Date and in the manner determined by the Plan Administrator, a payment in the
form of a lump sum.    3.2  Timing of Pension Payments: Traditional Pension Plan  Except as provided in 3.3(h), pension payments
to Participants in the Traditional Pension Plan commence as of the applicable effective date set forth in Article II.    3.2(a)  Timing of
Pension Payments: PEP  Except as provided in 3.3(h), pension payments to Participants in PEP commence as of the applicable effective date set forth in Article II unless the Participant elects, within 60 days of the later of (i) the date
of the letter provided by the Plan Administrator to the Participant that describes the Participant s Plan distribution options or (ii) the Participant s Severance From Service Date, and in the manner determined by the Plan
Administrator, to receive a lump sum or to commence to receive monthly installments as of the first day of the month following the Participant s Severance From Service Date.  
 3.2(b)  Timing of Pension Payments: Active Employees  Pension payments to a Participant who is an Employee and who attains age 70  1   2  before January 1, 2000, shall commence on April 1 of the year following the year during which the Participant attains age 70  1   2 . The pension payments will be recalculated and increased if appropriate as of  
      - 6 -  

each January 1 (and as of the Participant s Severance From Service Date) to reflect increases in the Normal Retirement Service Percentage and changes in Final Average Pay in the case of
a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan, and to reflect increases in Total Pension Credits and changes in Final Average Annual Pay in the case of a Participant in PEP.  
 Pension payments to a Participant who is an Employee and who attains age 70  1   2  after December 31, 1999 shall commence as of the first day of the month following the Participant s Severance From Service Date. The pension payments of a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan
will be actuarially increased to reflect the period described below during which the Participant does not receive any payments under the Plan. The period begins on the April 1 of the year following the year during which the Participant attains
age 70  1   2  and ends on the Benefit Commencement Date. The actuarial increase shall be calculated based on the interest rate and mortality table used in
determining Present Value.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, pension payments to a Participant who owns more than 5 percent of the
outstanding stock of an Employer or stock possessing more than 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all stock of an Employer, shall commence on April 1 of the year following the year during which the Participant attains age 70  1   2 .    The pension payments of a Participant in the
Traditional Pension Plan who is employed after Normal Retirement Date shall be actuarially increased to reflect any month in which the Participant completes an hour of service described in Section 202(a)(3)(B) of ERISA on fewer than eight days.
The actuarial increase shall be calculated based on the interest rate and mortality table used in determining Present Value.  
      - 7 -  

Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, all distributions from the Plan,
including distributions under Article V of the Plan, shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder, including the incidental benefit requirement of Section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the Proposed Income Tax
Regulations.    3.2(c)  Timing of Pension Payments: Mandatory Commencement  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary,
unless the Participant otherwise elects, pension payments to the Participant will begin not later than 60 days after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which (i) occurs the date on which the Participant attains the earlier of age 65 or
the Participant s Normal Retirement Date; (ii) occurs the 10 th  annual anniversary of the year in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan; or (iii) the Participant
terminates service with the Employer.    3.2(d)  Cessation of Pension Payments  Except as provided in Article V, monthly pension
payments shall permanently cease upon the death of the Participant, effective with the pension payment for the month following the month of the Participant s death. Monthly pension payments shall cease upon the Employer s reemployment of a
Participant as an Employee. Upon the Participant s subsequent termination of employment with the Employer, the Participant s Gross Pension shall be recalculated and adjusted (including the adjustment described in 3.4(a)) and the
Participant shall be given a new election with respect to the form and timing of his/her pension payments if such election otherwise would be available to the Participant.  
      - 8 -  

3.3  Amount of Pension Payments  The pension payments to which a Participant is
entitled are calculated based on the Participant s Gross Pension, adjusted as provided in 3.4. The calculation of a Participant s Gross Pension is different depending upon the type of retirement to which the Participant is entitled.  
 3.3(a)  Normal Retirement in the Traditional Pension Plan  The Gross Pension of a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan
entitled to Normal Retirement is calculated as follows:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
        
 Normal Retirement 
      
 X

   3.3(b)  Early Retirement in the Traditional Pension Plan  The Gross Pension of a Participant in the
Traditional Pension Plan entitled to Early Retirement is calculated as follows:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
      
   Normal Retirement   Service Percentage  
      
 X

   3.3(c)  Disability Retirement in the Traditional Pension Plan  The Gross Pension of a Participant in
the Traditional Pension Plan entitled to Disability Retirement is calculated as follows:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
      
   Normal Retirement   Service Percentage

      - 9 -  

Notwithstanding the foregoing calculation, the Gross Pension shall not be less than the lesser of 20% of Final
Average Pay, or the Gross Pension the Participant would be entitled to if he/she worked until his/her Normal Retirement Date and had the same Final Average Pay.  
 3.3(d)  Termination Benefits in the Traditional Pension Plan  The Gross Pension of a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan who
has a Severance From Service Date before the Participant is eligible for Normal Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability Retirement, but after accumulating at least five years of Vesting Service (effective January 1, 2008, three years of
Vesting Service), is equal to the Participant s Gross Pension as described in 4.1.    Except as provided in 3.3(h), such pension
payments shall commence as of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date and, except as provided in 3.3(h), shall be made in monthly installments. If the Participant has, however, at least ten years of Credited Service prior to the
Participant s Severance From Service Date, then such pension payments shall commence as of the first day of the month designated in writing by the Participant. The month so designated must be a month (i) no earlier than the month following
the attainment of age 55, and (ii) no later than the Participant s Normal Retirement Date. Such written designation must be received by the Plan Administrator before the beginning of the designated month. If a written designation is not
received, such pension payments will commence as of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date. Such pension payments are subject to the adjustment under the early receipt provisions set forth in 3.4(c).  
      - 10 -  

3.3(e)  Lump Sum in PEP  The Gross Pension of a Participant in PEP who elects an
immediate lump sum is calculated as follows:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
      
 Total Pension Credits 
      
 X 
        
   Final   Average 
 Annual   Pay   
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gross Pension shall not be less than the Present Value of the Participant s Accrued
Gross Pension which would have been payable as of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date based on the Participant s Final Average Pay and Credited Service as of December 31, 1999, the definition of Present Value and Accrued Gross
Pension in the Plan in effect on January 1, 2000, and the other provisions of the Plan in effect on December 31, 1999. Also, the Gross Pension shall not be less than the Present Value of the deferred annuity under 3.3(g) that would be
payable as of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date. If the Participant is subsequently reemployed by the Employer, the Participant shall not be given the option to repay the lump sum payment.  
 3.3(f)  Immediate Annuity in PEP   The Gross Pension of a Participant in PEP who elects an immediate annuity is calculated as 1/12
of the following:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
      
 Total Pension Credits 
      
 X 
      
 Final   Average   Annual 
 Pay  
      
  X  
      
   Annuity   Factor   
 
      - 11 -  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gross Pension of a Participant who is eligible for Early Retirement or Normal
Retirement shall not be less than the Participant s Accrued Gross Pension which would have been payable as of the Benefit Commencement Date based on the Participant s Final Average Pay and Credited Service as of December 31, 1999, the
definition of Accrued Gross Pension in the Plan in effect on January 1, 2000, and the other provisions of the Plan in effect on December 31, 1999.  
 3.3(g)  Deferred Annuity in PEP  The Gross Pension of a Participant in PEP who elects a deferred annuity is calculated as 1/12 of
the following:      

Gross Pension 
      
 = 
      
 Total   Pension   Credits  
      
 X

 X 
      
 Deferred   Annuity   Factor  
      
 X 
      
   Annuity   Factor   
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gross Pension shall not be less than the Participant s Accrued Gross Pension which
would have been payable as of the Benefit Commencement Date based on the Participant s Final Average Pay and Credited Service as of December 31, 1999, the definition of Accrued Gross Pension in the Plan in effect on January 1, 2000,
and the other provisions of the Plan in effect on December 31, 1999.    3.3(h)  Automatic Lump Sum Cash-Out  Notwithstanding
anything in the Plan to the contrary, an immediate lump sum payment, in lieu of monthly payments will be made to a Participant (i) in the Traditional Pension Plan, if the Present Value of the Participant s Gross Pension, computed as of the
Severance From Service Date, does not exceed $1,000, and (ii) in PEP, if the PEP Gross Pension lump sum under 3.3(e), computed as of the Severance From Service Date, does not exceed $1,000. If the Participant is subsequently reemployed by the
Employer, the Participant shall not be  
      - 12 -  

given the option to repay the lump sum payment. No payment shall be made from the Traditional Pension Plan, if the Present Value of the Participant s Gross Pension, computed as of the
Severance From Service Date, equals or exceeds $1,000, or the PEP, if the PEP Gross Pension lump sum under 3.3(e), computed as of the Severance From Service Date, equals or exceeds $1,000, absent the Participant s affirmative consent prior to
the Participant s Normal Retirement Date.    3.4  Miscellaneous Gross Pension Calculation Provisions   
 3.4(a)  Reemployment  As described in 3.2(d), monthly pension payments shall cease upon the Employer s reemployment of a
Participant as an Employee, and the Participant s Gross Pension shall be recalculated and adjusted upon the Participant s subsequent termination of employment with the Employer. The Gross Pension of the Participant upon subsequent
termination of employment shall be reduced by the value of monthly pension payments received prior to reemployment. The value shall be determined based on the interest rate and mortality table described in Present Value as of the Benefit
Commencement Date following the subsequent termination of employment.    3.4(b)  Adjustment for Part-Time Schedule  If a
Traditional Pension Plan Participant worked a Part-Time Schedule at any time during the period that the Participant was accumulating Credited Service, the Participant s Average Pay described in A-9(i) shall be adjusted by multiplying such
Average Pay described in A-9(i) by the following fraction:    Total of Participant s Regularly Scheduled Hours per Workweek During 35
Years of Credited Service With  Highest Number of Regularly Scheduled Hours  Total of All Regularly Scheduled Hours in Same Period of Credited Service Assuming Workweek of Standard Length Not in Excess of 40 Hours  
      - 13 -  

If a PEP Participant worked a Part-Time Schedule at any time during the period that the
Participant was accumulating Credited Service, the Participant s Gross Pension shall equal the sum of (i) the Participant s Total Pension Credits, adjusted as described below, times that portion of the Participant s Average
Annual Pay described in A-8(i), and (ii) the Participant s Total Pension Credits, not adjusted as described below, times that portion of the Participant s Average Annual Pay described in A-8(ii). The Participant s Total Pension
Credits shall equal the sum of the amounts attributable to each age category in the definition of Total Pension Credits times the following fraction in each age category:  
 Total of Participant s Regularly Scheduled Hours per Workweek During Years of Credited Service  in Each Age Category  Total of All
Regularly Scheduled Hours in Same Period of Credited Service Assuming Workweek of Standard Length Not in Excess of 40 Hours    For the
purposes of computing the Gross Pension of a Participant who worked a Part-Time Schedule, base rate of pay shall be adjusted to reflect a 40-hour workweek.  
 3.4(c)  Adjustment For Early Receipt in Traditional Pension Plan  If a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan who is entitled
to pension payments under 3.3(d) elects to begin receipt of his/her monthly pension payments prior to the date that the Participant attains age 65, the Participant s Gross Pension shall be reduced to offset the cost of early receipt. Such
reduction shall be determined in accordance with the table included in Appendix E.  
      - 14 -  

3.4(d)  Adjustment For Survivor Annuity Coverage  A Participant s Gross Pension in
the Traditional Pension Plan shall be reduced to offset the cost of providing (i) additional Preretirement Survivor Annuity coverage, and (ii) any Post-retirement Survivor Annuity coverage. A Participant s Gross Pension in PEP shall
be reduced to offset the cost of providing any Post-retirement Survivor Benefit coverage. Post-retirement Survivor Annuity and Post-retirement Survivor Benefit coverage reductions shall be determined in accordance with the table included in Appendix
F. Preretirement Survivor Annuity coverage reductions shall be determined in accordance with the table included in Appendix H.    3.4(e)
 Benefit and Benefit Accrual Limitations . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Gross Pension accrued on behalf of and provided to a Participant under the Plan shall at all times comply with applicable benefit
payment and accrual limitations in accordance with Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.    3.5  Severance Plan
Payments  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary, the Gross Pension for a Participant in the PEP who receives severance payments under the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan shall not be
less than the  minimum amount  which is the amount of the Participant s Gross Pension as of the Participant s Severance From Service Date based on (i) the Participant s Final Average Annual Pay as of the
Participant s Severance From Service Date; (ii) the Participant s age projected to the Participant s Severance End Date (but not older than the greater of the Participant s actual age on the Participant s Severance From
Service Date or 65); and (iii) the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service computed assuming the Participant were employed until the Participant s Severance End Date, and for a Participant who (x) elects an immediate
or deferred annuity, the  minimum amount  shall be computed assuming that the Annuity Factor used to convert the PEP Gross Pension lump sum to an annuity is based on the Participant s age and
 
      - 15 -  

Credited Service as of the Participant s Severance End Date and that the Annual Interest Rate used will be as specified by the Plan (i.e., based on the Participant s Severance From
Service Date); and (y) elects a deferred annuity to commence later than the first of the month following the Participant s Severance From Service Date the  minimum amount  shall be computed assuming a Deferred Annuity Factor of
1. For purposes of computing the  minimum amount , any reduction for Survivor Annuity coverage will be based on the factors specified by the Plan using the Participant s and the spouse s or the beneficiary s age as of the
Participant s Benefit Commencement Date.    Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary, the Gross
Pension for a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan who receives severance payments under the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan shall not be less than the  minimum amount  which is the amount of the Participant s
Gross Pension as of the Participant s Severance From Service Date based on (i) the Participant s Final Average Pay as of the Participant s Severance From Service Date (ii) the Participant s age projected to the
Participant s Severance End Date (but not older than the greater of the Participant s actual age on the Participant s Severance From Service Date or 65); and (iii) the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service
computed assuming the Participant were employed until the Participant s Severance End Date, and for a Participant who (x) is eligible for Normal Retirement based on the Participant s age projected to the Participant s Severance
End Date and based on the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service computed assuming the Participant were employed until the Participant s Severance End Date, for purposes of computing the  minimum amount  the
Participant s Benefit Commencement Date shall be assumed to be the later of the first of  
      - 16 -  

the month following the Participant s Severance from Service Date or the Participant s Normal Retirement Date; (y) is eligible for Early Retirement based on the Participant s
age projected to the Participant s Severance End Date and based on the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service computed assuming the Participant were employed until the Participant s Severance End Date, for purposes of
computing the  minimum amount  the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date shall be assumed to be the first of the month following the Participant s Severance End Date for purposes of determining the Early Retirement Adjustment
Factor; and (z) is not eligible for Normal Retirement or Early Retirement based on the Participant s age projected to the Participant s Severance End Date and based on the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service
computed assuming the Participant were employed until the Participant s Severance End Date, for purposes of computing the  minimum amount  the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date shall be assumed to be the earliest possible
date permitted under the Plan based on the Participant s age projected to the Participant s Severance End Date and based on the Participant s Credited Service and Vesting Service computed assuming the Participant were employed until
the Participant s Severance End Date. For purposes of computing the  minimum amount , any reduction for Survivor Annuity coverage will be based on the factors specified by the Plan using the Participant s and the spouse s
age as of the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date.    For purposes of calculating the  minimum amount  above, Severance
End Date means the last day of the month that includes the end of the severance period under the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan (notwithstanding the termination of the receipt severance benefits due to the Participant s return
to employment).  
      - 17 -  

A Participant s  minimum amount  shall be payable on any Benefit Commencement Date
allowable under the Plan without regard to this 3.5.    Except as expressly set forth above in this 3.5, this 3.5 will not affect any other
provision of the Plan or the Appendix relating to the calculation of a Participant s benefit, including the Severance From Service Date, Final Average Annual Pay, Final Average Pay, the Deferred Annuity Factor, the adjustment for survivor
coverage under 3.4(d), or the Annual Interest Rate.    This 3.5 is effective for Participants who commence receiving benefits under the
Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan on or after June 1, 2003.

ARTICLE IV   Gross Pension Calculation and Vesting  
 4.1  Termination Gross Pension Calculation and Service: Traditional Pension Plan  The Gross Pension of a Participant in the
Traditional Pension Plan who has a Severance From Service Date before the Participant is eligible for Normal Retirement, Early Retirement or Disability Retirement, but after accumulating at least five years of Vesting Service (effective
January 1, 2008, three years of Vesting Service), is calculated as follows:      

Gross Pension = 
     
 Projected Gross Pension at Normal Retirement Date 

X 
        
 Credited Service from Date of Hire to Calculation Date  

_________________________ 

Projected Credited Service from the Date of hire to Normal Retirement Date  
   In computing the  projected Gross Pension at Normal Retirement Date,  it will be assumed that a
Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan will continue to work for the Employer until the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, and that the Participant s Final Average Pay at such date will be equal to the Participant s Average
Pay as of the calculation date. If the Participant works a Part-Time Schedule as of the calculation date, it will be assumed that the Participant will continue to work a Part-Time Schedule until the Participant s Normal Retirement Date for
purposes of the computation.    4.2  Vested Right to Receive a Pension: Generally  A Participant will have a nonforfeitable right
to receive a pension under the Plan if he/she has completed at least five years of Vesting Service (effective January 1, 2008, three years of Vesting Service), or is an Employee on or after the later of age 65, or the date which is the fifth
anniversary of the Participant s Employment Commencement Date (or, if applicable, the Adjusted Employment Commencement Date).  
      - 19 -  

4.3  Credited Service  Credited Service accumulated by a Participant is used in the
computation of a Participant s Gross Pension. Under the Traditional Pension Plan, Participant s Credited Service is equal to the aggregate of all time periods, while classified as a Full-Time Employee, that commence with the Employment
Commencement Date (or, if applicable, the Adjusted Employment Commencement Date) and end with the Severance From Service Date. Under PEP, a Participant s Credited Service is equal to the number of months during which an Employee works at least
one hour while classified as a Full-Time Employee. Service while an Employee of a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company that is not designated by the Board of Directors (as reflected in Appendix G) under 1.1 shall not be counted in determining
Credited Service. Service while an Employee of a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company that is designated by the Board of Directors (as reflected in Appendix G) under 1.1 shall be counted in determining Credited Service only if the Employee is
eligible to participate in the Plan because of such service. Credited Service shall not be given to an Employee while classified by the Employer as a leased employee described in Code Section 414(n) or a co-op, work study or summer Employee.
Credited Service shall be accumulated in whole years and twelfths of a year.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who has at
least ten years of Credited Service prior to the date as of which the Participant first receives benefits under the Disability Plan, and who becomes a Disabled Participant on or after January 1, 1994, will continue to accrue Credited Service
while a Disabled Participant. The pension

payments made on and after August 1, 1999 on behalf of such a Participant who had a Severance From Service Date before January 1, 2000 shall be adjusted to reflect the accruing of
Credited Service while a Disabled Participant. The pension payments made on and after August 1, 1999 on behalf of such a Participant who had a Severance From Service Date before January 1, 2000 shall also be adjusted so that the payments
are no less than the amount the pension payments would be if the provisions of 3.3(c) had been applicable at the time of such Severance From Service Date.  
 4.4  Vesting Service  Vesting Service accumulated by a Participant is used in the determination of whether a Participant has a
vested right to receive pension payments. A Participant s Vesting Service is determined using the elapsed time method. Under the elapsed time method, the Participant is credited with service equal to the aggregate of all time periods that
commence with the Employment Commencement Date (or, if applicable, the Adjusted Employment Commencement Date) and end with the Severance From Service Date.  
 If a Participant is reemployed within one year from his/her Severance From Service Date, the Participant shall be deemed to have been
continuously employed by the Employer during such period, but only for purposes of accumulating Vesting Service. If a Participant dies while performing qualified military service (within the meaning of Section 414(u)(5) of the Code), such
Participant shall be credited with Vesting Service for the period of his qualified military service.  
      - 21 -  

4.5  Forfeiture and Restoration of Credited Service and Vesting Service  Once a
Participant has at least five years of Vesting Service (effective January 1, 2008, three years of Vesting Service), all Credited Service and Vesting Service, including all subsequently accumulated Credited Service and Vesting Service, is exempt
from forfeiture. If an Employee s Severance From Service Date occurs while he/she is zero percent vested under the Plan, such Employee s Credited Service and Vesting Service accumulated prior to such Severance From Service Date shall be
forfeited. All amounts so forfeited by a Participant who has a Severance From Service Date shall be deemed distributed to the Participant as of the Participant s Severance From Service Date for purposes of determining whether the Participant
received a distribution of his/her entire accrued benefit under the Plan. Any forfeited Credited Service and Vesting Service shall be restored upon reemployment, if the period of time elapsed between the Severance From Service Date and the date of
reemployment does not exceed five Plan Years.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who received a lump sum payment under 3.3(e)
or 3.3(h) shall not be entitled to restoration of Credited Service accumulated prior to the termination of employment that gave rise to the lump sum payment.  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of computing Credited Service and Vesting Service, the Severance From Service Date of an Employee
who is absent from service beyond the first anniversary of the first day of absence by reason of a maternity or paternity absence, is the second anniversary of the first day of such absence. The period of time between the first and second
anniversaries of the first day of absence from work is neither a period of service nor a period of severance.    4.6  Military
Service  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Code Section 414(u). Effective January 1, 2007, in the
case of a Participant who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)), the survivors of the Participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of
military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.

ARTICLE VI Procedures; Administration; Claims  
 6.1  Procedures: Commencement of Payments Under the Plan  Any payment required to be made under the Plan may, at the discretion of
the Plan Administrator, be suspended until the name and address of the recipient and all information necessary to determine the amount payable (including, when applicable, but not limited to, the recipient s age, proof of marital status and, if
married, an Appropriate Request that includes the name, birth date and current address of the Participant s spouse and which either rejects the 50% Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or Post-retirement Survivor Benefit or accepts such coverage
and requests or declines additional coverage) has been received by the Plan Administrator. Generally the Appropriate Request must be executed by the Participant and spouse (or their guardian, attorney-in-fact, or other legal representative), under
oath, before a notary public. The signature of a legal representative must be supported by a copy of the instrument effecting the appointment. However, for the purpose of the 50% spousal election for Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or
Post-retirement Survivor Benefit, the Appropriate Request does not need to be notarized. Payments that were suspended will be made in a lump sum, without interest, as soon as possible after the Plan Administrator receives such information. The Plan
Administrator may, in his/her sole discretion, require assurances in the form of an indemnity agreement or bond, prior to the commencement of any payments, if the accuracy of certain information has not been in his/her opinion conclusively
established. To the extent payments have not been claimed during a three year period, all payments will be forfeited. However, if the recipient subsequently files a proper claim with the Plan Administrator for such amounts, and the claim is filed
prior to the termination of the Plan, payments that were suspended will be made in a lump sum, without interest, as soon as possible after the Plan Administrator receives such claim.  
      - 35 -  

6.1(a)  Proof of Marital Status  The Plan Administrator may rely on a notarized written
declaration made on an Appropriate Request that a Participant is presently unmarried unless (i) the Participant s spouse is currently a designated beneficiary under any Employer-sponsored life insurance, or (ii) the Participant s
spouse is currently a dependent under any Employer-sponsored group health insurance. If (i) or (ii) above indicate that a spouse exists, the resulting presumption will be overcome if the notarized written declaration is supported by a copy
of a death certificate or final decree of divorce or annulment which, in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion, appears to have been properly issued. If an allegedly estranged spouse can t be reached by certified mail, return receipt
requested, at the last known address of the spouse, the Plan Administrator, in his/her sole discretion, may accept the Appropriate Request without the signature of the spouse (or the spouse s legal representative).

Survivor Annuity or Post-retirement Survivor Benefit  (i) The Plan Administrator shall furnish to the Participant a written explanation of (A) the terms and conditions of the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or Post-retirement Survivor
Benefit, (B) the Participant s right to make and the effect of an election to waive the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or the Post-retirement Survivor Benefit, (C) the rights of the Participant s spouse, and (D) the right

 (II) the distribution begins at least 7 days after the date that the written explanation is provided; and

with the written explanation in 6.2(c)(i) during the period in 6.2(c)(ii), a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan may waive the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or may elect additional Post-retirement Survivor Annuity coverage by an
Appropriate Request. A Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan may revoke such waiver or election and make a new election until the  
      - 39 -  

Participant s Benefit Commencement Date (or, if later, the expiration of the 7-day period that begins after the written explanation is provided), without limit on the number of changes that

Benefit with his/her spouse as beneficiary or selects a beneficiary other than his/her spouse for the Post-retirement Survivor Benefit, the waiver or selection shall be effective only if the Participant is not married on his/her Benefit Commencement
Date or the Participant s spouse on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date has consented to the waiver or selection in writing and such consent was witnessed by a notary public.  
 6.4  Plan Administration: The Administrative Committee

ARTICLE VII Plan Funding  
 7.1  Contributions  No contributions from any Participant shall be required or permitted under the Plan. The Employer shall make
contributions in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Investment Committee in accordance with a funding method and policy to be established by the Investment Committee. Forfeitures arising under this Plan shall be applied to reduce
the expenses of Plan administration, not to increase the benefits otherwise payable to Participants.    7.2  Payments to the
Trustee  All contributions made by the Employer under this Plan shall be paid to the Trustee and shall become assets of the Trust.  
      - 47 -  

ARTICLE VIII Miscellaneous Provisions  
 8.1  Inalienability of Benefits: Generally  No benefit or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assignment,
attachment, alienation, or other legal process, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Except as provided in 8.1(a), the preceding sentence will also apply to the creation, assignment or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a
Participant pursuant to a domestic relations order. Except as provided in 8.1(b) and 8.7, payments required under the Plan will be made to and in the name of the person entitled to such payments under the terms of the Plan, or to and in the name of
such person s authorized representative. Payments to any financial institution to the credit of such person will constitute payments to and in the name of the person entitled to such payments under the terms of the Plan.  
 8.1(a)  Qualified Domestic Relations Orders  The anti-alienation provisions of 8.1 do not apply to qualified domestic relations
orders, as the term is defined in Code Section 414(p). The Plan Administrator has established and will maintain written procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such
qualified orders. To the extent provided under a qualified domestic relations order, a former spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the spouse or Surviving Spouse for all purposes under the Plan.  
 A qualified domestic relations order will not require the Plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided
under the Plan.  
      - 48 -  

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if provided under a qualified domestic relations order,
an alternate payee as described in Code Section 414(p) may receive his/her entire interest under the order as a lump sum payment as soon as administratively possible after a domestic relation order is qualified by the Plan Administrator. Such
lump sum payment will be limited to (i) in the case of a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan, the Present Value of the Participant s Gross Pension under 3.3(a), calculated as of the date as of which the lump sum is paid, and
(ii) in the case of a Participant in PEP, the PEP Gross Pension lump sum under 3.3(e), calculated as of the date as of which the lump sum is paid. Unless unambiguously stated otherwise in the qualified domestic relations order, such lump sum
will equal a percentage or portion (as specified in the order) of the amount described in (i) or (ii) above.    A
Participant s Gross Pension (payable at the time and in the form such Gross Pension is actually paid to the Participant or, if the Participant dies before his/her Benefit Commencement Date, payable at the time and in the form the Preretirement
Survivor Annuity or Preretirement Survivor Benefit is actually paid to the Surviving Spouse or Alternate Beneficiary) will be reduced by the benefits provided to an alternate payee described in Code Section 414(p)(8) under a qualified domestic
relations order. Such Gross Pension will be reduced as follows:      

(i) 
   If the alternate payee receives a lump sum payment, the Gross Pension will be reduced by accumulating such lump sum payment with the Annual Interest
Rate from the date as of which the lump sum is paid to the Participant s (or the Surviving Spouse s or Alternate Beneficiary s) Benefit Commencement Date, and converting such accumulated amount to the form of payment paid to the
Participant (or Surviving Spouse or Alternate Beneficiary) using the Annual Interest Rate and the mortality table described in Code Section 417(e)(3). The Annual Interest Rate in
    
      - 49 -  

the preceding sentence will be (1) on and after January 1, 2008, the rate of interest specified under Code Section 417(e) as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and
clarified by Revenue Ruling 2007-67 and (2) prior to January 1, 2008, the annual rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities, in each case for the November of the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year in which the lump sum
payment is made to the alternate payee. For distributions with a Benefit Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2003 and prior to January 1, 2008, the mortality table shall be as prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 and for distributions
with a Benefit Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2008, the mortality table shall be as prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2007-67.        

(ii) 
 If the alternate payee receives monthly annuity payments and the Participant also receives monthly annuity payments, the alternate payee s monthly annuity payments have a Benefit Commencement Date that is on or
after the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, the alternate payee s monthly annuity payments are payable until a date that is no later than the Participant s date of death, and the alternate payee s monthly annuity payments
are no greater than the monthly payment the Participant would receive if the qualified domestic relations order did not exist, the Participant s monthly annuity payments will be reduced by the dollar amount of the monthly annuity payments
provided to the alternate payee.    
      - 50 -  

(iii) 
 If the alternate payee receives monthly annuity payments and the conditions in (ii) are not satisfied, the Gross Pension will be reduced by accumulating the Present Value of the alternate payee s monthly
annuity payments (with such Present Value being determined as of the date such annuity payments begin to be paid to the alternate payee) with the Annual Interest Rate from the date as of which such Present Value is determined to the
Participant s (or Surviving Spouse s or Alternate Beneficiary s) Benefit Commencement Date, and converting such accumulated amount to the form of payment paid to the Participant (or Surviving Spouse or Alternate Beneficiary) using the
Annual Interest Rate and the mortality table described in Code Section 417(e)(3). The Annual Interest Rate in the preceding sentence will be (1) on and after January 1, 2008, the rate of interest specified under Code
Section 417(e)(3) as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and clarified by Revenue Ruling 2007-67 and (2) prior to January 1, 2008, the annual rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities, in each case, for the November of
the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year in which the Present Value is determined. For distributions with a Benefit Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2003 and prior to January 1, 2008, the mortality table shall be as
prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 and for distributions with a Benefit Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2008, the mortality table shall be as prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2007-67.    
 8.1(b)  Miscellaneous Exceptions  The anti-alienation provisions of 8.1 do not apply to certain voluntary and revocable assignments
or alienations or other arrangements permitted under the Code and ERISA, including under Code Section 401(a)(13) and the applicable Treasury regulations.  
      - 51 -  

8.2  Exclusive Benefit: Generally  Except as provided in 8.2(a), all contributions made
by any Employer to any insurance company or Trustee for the purpose of funding the Plan are irrevocable and shall not revert to the Employer. Prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan, such contributions, as well as the corpus and
income of the Trust, shall not be diverted to or used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of Plan administration, including expenses of service providers who support
plan administrative or fiduciary functions.    8.2(a)  Exceptions  Any contribution made by an Employer by mistake of fact shall
be returned to the Employer provided the return is made within one year after the payment of such contribution to the insurance company or Trustee, and provided further that earnings attributable to the excess contribution may not be returned to the
Employer, but losses attributable to the excess contribution must reduce the amount returned.    Any contribution made by an Employer shall
be returned to the Employer to the extent the deduction of such contribution is disallowed under Code Section 404, provided the return is made within one year after the disallowance of the deduction by the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes
of this provision, all contributions made by an Employer to the Plan are expressly conditioned upon their deductibility under Code Section 404, and any nondeductible contributions must be returned to the Employer.  
 Any excess assets shall be returned to the Employer upon the Plan s termination, but only after satisfaction of all Plan liabilities to
Participants and their beneficiaries.  
      - 52 -  

8.3  No Right to Employment  Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed as a
contract of employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to continue in the employment of an Employer or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge an Employee with or without cause.  
 8.4  Controlling Law  The Plan and its administration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland except to the extent
preempted by Federal law.    8.5  Number  Words used in the singular are intended to include the plural, whenever appropriate.
   8.6  Titles and Headings  Titles of Articles and headings to Sections in the Plan are placed herein solely for convenience of
reference and, in any case of conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles and headings, shall control.    8.7  Payment of
Benefits to Incompetents  If the Plan Administrator determines that any participant, spouse or beneficiary is unable to care for his affairs because of minority, illness, infirmity, accident or any other reason, any distributions due may be
made at the direction of the Plan Administrator to the guardian, conservator, legal representative, spouse, child, parent or other blood relative or to any person deemed by the Plan Administrator to have incurred expenses for such participant,
spouse, or beneficiary entitled to distributions under the Plan. Such distribution shall, to the extent thereof, be a complete discharge of all liabilities of the Plan, the Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee and the Trust.

entitled to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or partial termination (to the extent funded as of such date) shall be nonforfeitable. A Participant whose benefits were forfeited, in accordance with 4.5, prior to the date of termination

      - 58 -  

its Trust, as the case may be, and in all cases except to the extent such employee s benefit is subsequently spun back to the other plan pursuant to this paragraph). Under no circumstances

of interest used under this A-4 during the 5-year period ending on the termination date.  
      A-1  

A-5  Annuity Factor  means the factor which is used to convert a PEP Gross Pension lump
sum to an annuity. The factor is based on a Participant s age at the Benefit Commencement Date, the mortality table described in Code Section 417(e)(3), and the Annual Interest Rate. For distributions with a Benefit Commencement Date on or
after January 1, 2003 and prior to January 1, 2008, the mortality table used for purposes of satisfying the requirement of Code Section 417(e)(3) is the table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 and for distributions with a Benefit
Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2008, the mortality table used for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Code Section 417(e)(3) is the table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2007-67. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following
increase is made to the Annual Interest Rate in determining the Annuity Factor: if (i) the Participant is eligible for Early Retirement under 2.2 on his/her Severance From Service Date or (ii) the Participant becomes a Disabled Participant
on or after January 1, 1994, the Participant completes at least ten years of Credited Service prior to the date the Participant first benefits under the Disability Plan, and the Participant ceases to be a Disabled Participant on or after age 55

described in the preceding sentence is not applicable.    A-6  Applicable Interest Rate  means, as set forth in Code
Section 417(e)(3)(B), the interest rate which would be used (as of the effective date of the distribution) by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a lump sum distribution on plan termination.

benefits begin under the Disability Plan in the  
      A-3  

case of a Disabled Participant) including the base rate of pay described in (i) which the Employee would have been paid for the month which includes the Severance From Service Date if he/she
had worked to the end of such month to the last 12 month increment, and then taking the average of the three 12-month periods during which the highest amounts were paid. The base salary of an Employee on unpaid leave of absence shall be considered
paid for purposes of calculating Average Annual Pay. For purposes of (i), only license bonuses set forth in Appendix I, Part 1 will be included in the computation of Average Annual Pay. For purposes of (ii), only bonuses and/or incentives that are
set forth in Appendix I, Part 2 will be included in the computation of Average Annual Pay. The eligible pay of each Participant for each 12-month increment shall not exceed the limitations set forth in Appendix B, Section B-3. To determine Average
Annual Pay for a Transferred Participant, amounts described in (i) and (ii) of this section shall include amounts paid by CENG or other Employer under the applicable CENG Plan, but only to the extent that such amounts (x) would be
included for purposes of calculating the Transferred Participant s Average Annual Pay under the applicable CEG PEP Plan if such amounts had been paid by an Employer under this Plan, and (y) were paid during the 60-month period (in five
consecutive 12-month increments) ending on the last day of the month that includes the Transferred Participant s Severance From Service Date described above. For a Transferred Participant, depending on the Participant s Severance From

Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code). The base salary of an Employee on unpaid leave of absence shall be considered paid for purposes of calculating Average Pay. For purposes of (i), only license bonuses set forth in Appendix I, Part 1 will be
included in the computation of Average Pay. For purposes of (ii), only bonuses and/or incentives set forth in Appendix I, Part 2 will be included in the computation of Average Pay. The eligible pay of each Participant for the most current 12-month
period of active employment and for the immediately preceding 12-month period shall not exceed the limitations set forth in Appendix B, Section B-3. To determine Average Pay for a Transferred Participant, amounts described in (i) and
(ii) shall include amounts paid by CENG or other Employer under the CENG Traditional Plan, but only to the extent that such amounts (x) would be included for purposes of calculating the Transferred Participant s Average Pay under the
CEG Traditional Plan if such amounts had been paid by an Employer under this Plan, and (y) were paid during the most current 730 days of active employment described above. For a Transferred Participant, depending on the Participant s

and other requirements prescribed in this B-1 shall at all times be administered in a manner which will result in compliance with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference.    (b) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, in addition to other limitations set
forth in the Plan and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the  Annual Benefit  otherwise payable to a Participant under the Plan shall not exceed the  Maximum Permissible Benefit  (as defined below). If the benefit
the Participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an Annual Benefit in excess of the Maximum Permissible Benefit, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the Maximum
Permissible Benefit. If the Participant is, or ever has been, a participant in another qualified defined benefit plan (without regard to whether the plan has been terminated) maintained by the Employer or its predecessor (within the meaning of
Section 1.415(f)-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations), the sum of the Participant s annual benefit from all such plans may not exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit. The Annual Benefit of a Participant may be increased as the Maximum
Permissible Benefit is adjusted in accordance with Code Section 415(d), but only prior to the commencement of pension payments.

form of benefit and is payable on the first day of each month before applying the limitations of this B-1. The determination of the Annual Benefit shall take into account benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers
of distributable benefits pursuant to Section 1.411(d)-4, Q A-3(c) of the Treasury Regulations, but shall disregard benefits, if any, attributable to employee contributions or rollover contributions.  
 (d) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007 for purposes of this B-1,  Maximum Permissible Amount  means the
lesser of (i) or (ii) below:    (i) $180,000, adjusted under Section 415(d) of the Code effective

applies.    (ii) 100% of the Participant s high three-year compensation, or, if the Participant does not have three
consecutive years of service, 100% of the Participant s average compensation over the longest consecutive period of service (including fractions of years, but not less than one year), payable in the form of a straight life annuity. In the case
of a Participant who is rehired by the Employer after a severance from employment,  
      B-2  

the Participant s high three-year average compensation shall be calculated excluding all years for which the Participant performs no services for and receives no compensation from the
Employer and by treating the years immediately preceding and following the break as consecutive.    (iii) Notwithstanding
anything in this section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to the Participant under the Plan shall be deemed not to exceed the Maximum Permissible Benefit if the retirement benefits payable for a limitation year under any
form of benefit with respect to such Participant under this Plan and all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a plan as been terminated) ever maintained by the Employer do not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Participant s number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service (not to exceed 10) with the Employer, and the denominator of which is 10; and the Employer (or predecessor employer) has not at any time
maintained a defined contribution plan in which the Participant participated.    (e) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1,
2007 for purposes of this B-1,  compensation  means Section 415(c) Compensation. In addition, for purposes of this B-1 for limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall also include amounts paid by the
later of 2 1/2 months after a Participant s severance from employment with the Employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of such severance from employment if the payment is regular compensation for services (within the
meaning of Section 1.415(c)-2(e)(3)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments paid after the Participant s severance from employment (but by the later of 2 1/2 months after such severance from
employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of such severance from employment) that would have been paid to the Participant absent such severance from employment had the Participant continued in employment with the Employer.
 
      B-3  

Any payments not described above shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this B-1 for limitation
years beginning on or after July 1, 2007 if paid after severance from employment, even if paid by the later of 2 1/2 months after the date of severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of such severance
from employment, except:    (i) payments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the employer by reason
of qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed amounts the individual would have received if the individual would had continued to perform services for the Employer rather
than entering qualified military service; or    (ii) compensation paid to a Participant who is permanently and totally
disabled, as defined in Code Section 22(e)(3), provided that salary continuation applies to all Participants who are permanently and totally disabled for a fixed or determinable period, or the Participant was not a highly compensated employee
immediately before becoming disabled.    Back pay, within the meaning of Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8) of the Treasury Regulations, shall be treated as
compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent that back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included as  compensation  as defined herein.  
      B-4  

(f) For purposes of complying with Code Section 415, a limitation year means the calendar
year.    (g) Adjustments to Annual Benefit and Limitations  
 (i) For purposes of applying the limits of Code Section 415 and this B-1, for limitation years beginning on or after
July 1, 2007, a benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code must be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals the greater of
the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable under the Plan at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value
as the Participant s form of benefit computed using an interest rate of 5% and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date.  
 (ii) For Plan benefits subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity for
annuity starting dates beginning after 2005 is equal to the greatest of (i) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant s form of
benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; (ii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting
date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5 % interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table; and (iii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity
commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table, divided by 1.05.  
      B-5  

(iii) For Plan benefits subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code with an
annuity starting date in a Plan Year beginning in 2004 or 2005, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial
present value as the Participant s form of benefit, computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (i) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the Plan for adjusting
benefits in the same form; and (ii) a 5.5 % interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table.    (iv)
For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, if the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the defined benefit dollar limitation (described in B-1(d)(i) above, adjusted as applicable) applicable to the Participant at such
earlier age is limited to the lesser of (1) the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant s annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar
limitation (as adjusted under B-1(g)(vi) for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table and expressing the Participant s age
based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date or (2) the product of the defined benefit dollar limitation (as adjusted under B-1(g)(vi) for years of participation less than 10, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the
annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity at the Participant s annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of
Code Section 415.  
      B-6  

(v) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, if the benefit
of a Participant begins after the Participant attains age 65, the defined benefit dollar limitation (described in B-1(d)(i) above, adjusted as applicable) is the lesser of (1) the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight
life annuity commencing at the Participant s annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation (as adjusted under B-1(g)(vi) for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial
equivalence computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date (and expressing the Participant s age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date) or (2) the
defined benefit dollar limitation (as adjusted under B-1(g)(vi) for years of participation less than 10, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the
Participant s annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of Code Section 415. For this purpose, the
adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant s annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the Participant, computed disregarding the Participant s accruals after age 65
but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable
under the Plan to a hypothetical Participant who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the Participant.  
      B-7  

(vi) If the Participant has less than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the
defined benefit dollar limitation (described in B-1(d)(i) above, adjusted as applicable) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of participation in the Plan, and
the denominator of which is 10. If the Participant has less than 10 years of service, the defined benefit compensation limit (described in B-1(d)(ii) above) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part
thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the employer, and the denominator of which is 10.    (vii) In applying
the limitations in Code Section 415(b), the Code Section 415(b)(2)(E) changes made by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (GATT) and Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 shall be effective as of January 1, 2000. For this purpose,
the time for determining the applicable interest rate under Code Section 417(e)(3) shall be the November of the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year that contains the Benefit Commencement Date. For distributions with a Benefit
Commencement Date on or after January 1, 2003, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Code Sections 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) is the table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62. For
limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the applicable interest rate shall be the first, second, and third segment rates described in Code Section 417(e)(3)(C), for the November of the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan
Year that contains the Benefit Commencement Date and the applicable mortality table shall be the mortality table, as modified by the Secretary of Treasury, described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code that applies as of the Benefit
Commencement Date.  
      B-8  

(h) All members of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code Section 414(b),
commonly controlled trades or businesses (as defined in Code Section 414(c)), or affiliated service groups (as defined in Code Section 414(m)) that include the Employer, and any other entity required to be aggregated with the Employer
pursuant to Code Section 414(o) shall be considered as a single employer for purposes of applying the limitations described in Section 415 of the Code and this B-1.  
 (i) If (i) a Participant is also benefiting under another defined benefit plan sponsored by the Employer or its predecessor, and
(ii) reductions in either the amount of the Participant s annual benefit under the Plan or the amount of the Participant s annual benefit under such other plan (or both) are necessary to comply with Code Section 415, a reduction
in the Participant s annual benefit under the Plan shall be made to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 415, prior to any reduction in the Participant s annual benefit any other plan(s).  
 (j) The application of the provisions of this B-1 shall not cause the Maximum Permissible Benefit for any Participant to be less than the
Participant s accrued benefit as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007 under the provisions of the Plan that were adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007.  
      B-9  

B-2  Maximum Pension Payment: Treasury Regulation Limits  Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Plan to the contrary, pension payments to the top 25 highly compensated employees and former highly compensated employees, as those terms are defined in Code Section 414(q) and the related regulations, with the greatest
compensation (as that term is defined in Code Section 414(s) and the related regulations) in the current Plan Year and any prior Plan Year, shall be restricted as required under Section 1.401(a)(4)-5(b)(3) of the Treasury regulations,
unless the exception set forth in such section applies.    B-3  Compensation Limitation Under Code Section 401(a)(17)  In
addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the Plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the annual compensation of each Employee taken into
account under the Plan shall not exceed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (hereinafter referred to in this Section B-4 as  OBRA  93 ) annual compensation limit. The OBRA  93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, as
adjusted by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12
months, over which compensation is determined (hereinafter referred to as  Determination Period ) beginning in such calendar year.  
 For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, any reference in this Plan to the limitation under Code Section 401(a)(17)
shall mean the OBRA  93 annual compensation limit set forth in this provision.    If compensation for any prior Determination Period is
taken into account in determining an Employee s benefits accruing in the current Plan Year, the compensation for that prior Determination Period is subject to the OBRA  93 annual compensation limit in effect for that prior Determination
Period. For this purpose, for Determination Periods beginning before the first day of the first Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the OBRA  93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.  
      B-10  

Unless otherwise provided under the Plan, each Code Section 401(a)(17) employee s
accrued benefit under this Plan will be the greater of the accrued benefit determined for such Employee under 1 or 2 below:    1. The
Employee s accrued benefit determined with respect to the benefit formula applicable for the Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, as applied to the Employee s total years of service taken into account under the Plan for
the purposes of benefit accruals, or    2. the sum of:  
 (a) the Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before January 1, 1994, frozen in accordance
with Section 1.401(a)(4)-13 of the Treasury regulations; and    (b) the Employee s accrued benefit determined under the benefit
formula applicable for the Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, as applied to the Employee s years of service credited to the Employee for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, for purposes of benefit accruals.
   For purposes of making the calculation in 2. above, the following rules shall apply:  
 1. An Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before January 1, 1994 shall be determined after
limiting Average Pay to $228,860 for 1992 and $235,840 for 1993;  
      B-11  

2. An Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before
January 1, 1994 shall be determined by assuming the Employee is eligible for the early retirement benefits and the early retirement reductions for which the Employee is eligible at the Employee s Severance From Service Date;  
 3. An Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before January 1, 1994 shall be determined based
on the project and prorate method (i.e., the projected Gross Pension on December 31, 1993 assuming employment until Normal Retirement Date times Credited Service as of December 31, 1993, divided by projected Credited Service at Normal
Retirement Date) if the Employee is not eligible for Early Retirement on December 31, 1993. If such an Employee is eligible for Early Retirement on the Employee s Severance From Service Date, the Employee s accrued benefit as applied
to the Employee s years of service credited to the Employee for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1994 shall be calculated by subtracting the December 31, 1993 benefit, calculated using the $150,000 compensation limit
(reflecting cost-of-living increases in the $150,000 compensation limit) from the benefit at the Employee s Severance From Service Date based on all service;  
 4. An Employee who participates in the PEP may receive a lump-sum payment of the Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the
last Plan Year beginning before January 1, 1994 based on the assumptions in the Plan used to convert an immediate lump sum to a deferred annuity beginning at the Employee s Normal Retirement Date; and  
      B-12  

5. The Employee s accrued benefit as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before
January 1, 1994 for an Employee who participates in the PEP is converted to a lump sum based on the assumptions used to determine the Present Value of an accrued benefit or the assumptions that are used to convert a lump-sum benefit under the
PEP to a life annuity beginning at the Employee s Normal Retirement Date, whichever results in the larger lump sum.    A Code
Section 401(a)(17) employee means an Employee whose current accrued benefit as of a date on or after the first day of the first Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, is based on compensation for a year beginning prior to the
first day of the first Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, that exceeds $150,000.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the annual compensation of each Employee taken into account under the Plan shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost of living increases in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B). The
cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the Determination Period beginning in such calendar year. For purposes of determining benefit accruals in a Plan Year beginning on or after January 1,
2002, the annual compensation taken into account in any Plan Year preceding the Plan Year beginning on January 1, 2002 shall be limited to $200,000.  
      B-13  

APPENDIX C    
 TRANSITION AND HISTORICAL PROVISIONS  
 C-1  Normal Retirement Service Percentage  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, each Participant who
(i) was an active Employee of the Employer on December 31, 1975, (ii) continuously accrues Credited Service from such date through the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, and (iii) has accumulated Credited Service on the
day prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Date equal to at least 15 years but less than 20 years, has a Normal Retirement Service Percentage of 30%, adjusted for Part-Time Schedule as provided in 3.4(b) if applicable. This C-1 will not
be effective after December 31, 1995.    C-2  Part-Time Schedule Adjustment  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan
to the contrary, each Participant who (i) was an active Employee of the Employer on December 31, 1975, (ii) continuously accrues Credited Service from such date through the date the Participant quits, retires, is discharged, becomes
disabled, or dies, and (iii) could receive a larger Gross Pension if the Part-Time Schedule adjustment provisions of the Plan in effect on December 31, 1975 were currently applicable, will be entitled to such larger Gross Pension.  
 C-3  Former Susquehanna Transmission Company Employees  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, service
with the Susquehanna Transmission Company by an Employee who became employed by the Employer because of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company s acquisition of such company, will count as Credited Service and Vesting Service, to the same extent and
 
      C-1  

subject to the same limitations as if such service had been rendered for the Employer. The Gross Pension of any Participant affected by this provision who quits, retires, is discharged, becomes
disabled or dies with a vested right to a benefit under the Plan, and who is entitled to an annuity under another arrangement by virtue of such Participant s previous employment with the Susquehanna Transmission Company, will be reduced by the
amount of such annuity.    C-4  Voluntary Retirement Early Receipt of Pension Payments  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of the Plan, a Participant who retired under the Voluntary Retirement provisions that were in effect prior to July 1, 1986, may elect to begin receipt of his/her monthly pension payments prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Date,
subject to the adjustment under the early receipt provisions in 3.4(c). Such pension payments shall commence as of the first day of the month designated in writing by the Participant. The month so designated must be a month (i) later than the
month during which the Plan Administrator receives the Participant s written election, and (ii) before the Participant s Normal Retirement Date.  
 C-5  Preretirement Survivor Annuity Coverage For Certain Participants  The provisions of this C-5, and not 5.1 or 5.2, shall apply
to a Participant who quit or was discharged from employment with the Employer after September 1, 1974 and before January 1, 1985. If such Participant (i) terminated employment with a vested right to receive a pension payment equal to
the Participant s Gross Pension (as computed under the terms of the Plan on the date the Participant terminated active employment), (ii) dies prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, (iii) was not eligible to elect
Preretirement Survivor Annuity coverage while an active Employee, and (iv) makes the  
      C-2  

election in the following paragraph, then the Surviving Spouse of such Participant will receive a Preretirement Survivor Annuity equal to 50% of such pension (actuarially reduced if necessary to
account for the age of the Surviving Spouse and for payment prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Date).    The
Participant s election for the 50% Preretirement Survivor Annuity coverage must be made prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. The coverage commences on the first day of the month following receipt of the Participant s
election by the Plan Administrator. Such coverage automatically ceases as set forth in 5.1(c). The Participant may cancel the coverage, without the consent of the Participant s spouse, by delivering an Appropriate Request to the Plan
Administrator prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. Such cancellation is effective as of the first day of the month following receipt by the Plan Administrator of the Appropriate Request. Cancellation is automatic if the
Participant s spouse dies prior to the effective date of the coverage. A Participant s pension payments are not reduced for the cost of coverage.  
 C-6  Post-retirement Survivor Annuity Coverage for Certain Participants  The provisions of this C-6, and not 5.3 or 5.4, shall apply
to a Participant who quit or was discharged from employment with the Employer after September 1, 1974 and prior to January 1, 1976. If such Participant (i) terminates employment with a vested right to receive a pension payment equal
to the Participant s Gross Pension (as computed under the terms of the Plan on the date the Participant terminated active employment), (ii) dies on or before the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, and (iii) makes the
election in the following paragraph, then the Surviving Spouse of such Participant will receive a Post-retirement Survivor Annuity equal to 50% of such pension (actuarially reduced if necessary to account for the age of the Surviving Spouse and for
payment prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Date).  
      C-3  

The Participant s election for the 50% Post-retirement Survivor Annuity must be made prior
to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. The Participant may revoke an election, without the consent of the Participant s spouse, by delivering an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator prior to the Participant s Benefit
Commencement Date. Cancellation is automatic if the Participant s spouse dies prior to the effective date of the coverage. The coverage commences on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. Such coverage automatically ceases upon the
date of death of the spouse. A Participant s pension payments are reduced to offset the cost of coverage.    Within 90 days prior to
such Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, the Plan Administrator will mail to the Participant s last known address (i) written explanation of the terms and conditions of the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity and (ii) an
estimate of the relative values of the various optional forms of benefit under the Plan if the fact of marriage and the age of the spouse are known to the Plan Administrator. In the case of a Participant whose Benefit Commencement Date is before or
after the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, the Plan Administrator shall mail the written explanation to the Participant by the later of (i) 90 days prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, or (ii) 7 days after
the Plan Administrator is notified of the Participant s intention to retire.  
      C-4  

C-7  Participants Who Terminated Employment Before 1989  A Participant who terminated
employment prior to January 1, 1989 without a vested right to the Participant s Gross Pension, and who is subsequently reemployed by the Employer, will be subject to the service forfeiture, restoration and vesting provisions currently
under this Plan, retroactive to the Employee s original Employment Commencement Date. If retroactive application of these provisions results in a vested right to the Participant s Gross Pension prior to the date of the Participant s
termination of employment, Credited Service taken into account to determine such vesting, and Credited Service subsequently accumulated through the date of termination of employment, shall be restored.  
 A Participant who terminated employment prior to January 1, 1989 with a vested right to the Participant s Gross Pension, and who is
subsequently reemployed by the Employer, will be subject to the forfeiture, restoration and vesting provisions currently under this Plan, retroactive to the Employee s original Employment Commencement Date. If retroactive application of these
provisions results in a larger amount of potentially restorable Credited Service than the amount of Credited Service actually accumulated prior to the date of the Participant s termination of employment, the larger amount of Credited Service
will be restored.    C-8  Voluntary Special Early Retirement Program  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or any
Appendix to the contrary, each Participant who under the terms of the Plan is eligible to commence Early Retirement, and who voluntarily elects to commence Early Retirement on or after February 1, 1992 and on or before April 1, 1992, shall
be entitled to an enhanced benefit, subject to the Employer s right to limit benefits to the extent necessary to satisfy tax law limitations. The Employer also reserves the right to delay the Early Retirement commencement date of eligible
Participants until no later than April 1, 1992, if operating condition requirements warrant such a delay. For purposes of this C-8, the enhanced benefit is determined based on the calculation of the
 
      C-5  

Gross Pension of a Participant entitled to Early Retirement as set forth under 3.3(b), except that the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor shall be computed as follows:  
 The Early Retirement Adjustment Factor for Participants with a Benefit Commencement Date that is on or after the date that the Participant
attains age 60, is 100 percent. For all other Participants, the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor is 100 percent less 1/4 of 1 percent for each month that the Participant is less than age 60 on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. For
purposes of this calculation, the month of the Participant s 60th birthday is excluded.    The amount of pension payments for Participants entitled to
an enhanced benefit under this C-8 is computed taking into account all other adjustments required under the terms of the Plan in the computation of pension payments. A Participant who commences Early Retirement under this C-8, and who is
subsequently reemployed by the Employer, will be entitled to benefits under the Plan based on the provisions in effect at the time that the Participant subsequently retires.  
 C-9  Voluntary Special Early Retirement Program  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary,
certain Participants who meet the conditions set forth in the next sentence are eligible for Early Retirement if, as of February 1, 1994 they satisfy the requirements of 2.2 after substituting age 50 for age 55 and 15 years of Credited Service
for 20 years of Credited Service. The conditions such Participants must meet are as follows: (1) the Participant makes an election between October 15, 1993 and December 15, 1993 to voluntarily commence Early Retirement on
February 1, 1994, and such election shall be irrevocable effective December 15, 1993,  
      C-6  

and (2) the Participant does not elect to participate in the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Voluntary Severance Plan. Participants who satisfy the requirements and conditions set forth
in the two preceding sentences shall be entitled to an enhanced benefit, subject to the Employer s right to limit benefits to the extent necessary to satisfy tax law limitations.  
 For purposes of this C-9, the enhanced benefit for eligible Participants is determined based on the calculation of the Gross Pension of a
Participant entitled to Early Retirement as set forth under 3.3(b), except that the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor shall be computed as follows:  
 The Early Retirement Adjustment Factor for Participants with a Benefit Commencement Date that is on or after the date that the Participant
attains age 60, is 100 percent. For Participants with a Benefit Commencement Date that is on or after the date that the Participant attains age 55 but before the date that the Participant attains age 60, the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor is 100
percent less 1/4 of 1 percent for each month that the Participant is less than age 60 on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. For all other Participants, the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor is 100 percent less the percentage equal to
(i) 15 percent plus (ii) 1/2 of 1 percent for each month that the Participant is less than age 55 on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. For purposes of this calculation, the month of the Participant s 55th and 60th
birthdays is excluded.  
      C-7  

In addition, the enhanced benefit for eligible Participants who have not attained age 62 as of
February 1, 1994 will include an additional monthly payment from the Plan. The amount of the payment shall be equal to one-half of the Participant s estimated monthly age 62 Social Security benefits computed assuming no earnings after
1993. The amount of such estimated age 62 Social Security benefits shall be provided to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company by the Social Security Administration and shall be final and not subject to challenge. The payments shall cease effective when
the Participant is first eligible to receive reduced old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. The payments shall not be subject to the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity provisions of Article V and shall not be subject to
the pension payment adjustment provisions of 3.4(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if a Participant who is otherwise entitled to a monthly payment under this paragraph fails to submit to the Employer by
December 15, 1993, a completed and signed Social Security Administration Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement, then the amount of such payment shall be $200.  
 Except as otherwise provided in the preceding paragraph, the amount of pension payments for Participants entitled to an enhanced benefit under
this C-9 is computed taking into account all other adjustments required under the terms of the Plan in the computation of pension payments. A Participant who commences Early Retirement under this C-9, and who is subsequently reemployed by the
Employer, will be entitled to benefits under the Plan based on the provisions in effect at the time that the Participant subsequently retires.  
 C-10  Pre-1994 Disability Retirement  This Appendix C-10 applies to Participants who became a Disabled Participant prior to
January 1, 1994. Benefits under the Plan for Participants who became Disabled Participants on or after January 1, 1994 are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan except this Appendix C-10. All defined terms used in this
C-10 that are not separately defined in this C-10 have the meaning set forth in Appendix A.  
      C-8  

Types of Retirement:   
  Disabled Participants  A Disabled Participant who is eligible for Early Retirement on or before his/her Severance From Service Date,
may elect Early Retirement if certain requirements are satisfied. To be eligible to elect Early Retirement, such Disabled Participant must retire either (i) during the period that is within one year following both classification as a Disabled
Participant and a reduction in the amount of benefits payable to the Disabled Participant under the Disability Plan due to that plan s offset provisions, or (ii) following termination of the Disability Plan and the failure of the Company
to establish a successor plan or policy to provide similar benefits.     Disability Retirement: Generally  A Disabled Participant
who is at least age 65 and who, prior to his/her Severance From Service Date, has at least ten years of Credited Service, is eligible for Disability Retirement.

  Early Disability Retirement  A Disabled Participant who, (i) prior to his/her Severance From Service Date, has at least 20
years of Credited Service, and (ii) is at least age 55 but has not yet reached age 65 when he/she is determined to be no longer disabled under the terms of the Disability Plan, is eligible for Early Disability Retirement.  
  Effective Date  Early Disability Retirement is effective on the first day of the month of retirement designated in writing by the
Participant, which is on or after the date that the Participant becomes eligible for Early Disability Retirement, and on or before the Participant s Normal Retirement Date. Such written designation must be received by the Plan Administrator
before the beginning of the designated month.

      C-10  

DEFINITIONS  
 The following definitions apply to the disability benefits under this Plan prior to January 1, 1994:  
  Disability Retirement  means a type of retirement available to a Disabled Participant who is at least age 65 prior to his/her
Severance From Service Date, and has at least ten years of Credited Service.     Disability Retirement Service Percentage  means
the greater of (i) the percentage equal to (x) the Normal Retirement Service Percentage, less (y) 1/12 of 1 percent for each month that the Participant was less than age 65 on the Participant s Severance From Service Date, or
(ii) 30 percent. For purposes of this calculation, the month of the Severance From Service Date is excluded, and the month of the Participant s 65th birthday is included.  
  Disabled Participant  means a Participant who is disabled as that term is defined in the Disability Plan.  
  Early Disability Retirement  means a type of retirement available to a Disabled Participant who, on the day preceding his/her
Severance From Service Date, has at least 20 years of Credited Service, and who is at least age 55 (but not yet age 65) when he/she ceases benefiting under the Disability Plan because he/she is determined to be no longer disabled under the terms of
such plan.    C-11  Prior Plan  Except as provided in 1.2 and the last paragraph of 4.3, Participants who do not earn Credited
Service on or after January 1, 2000 are covered by the provisions in the Plan in effect before January 1, 2000.  
      C-11  

C-12  Accrued Gross Pension Calculation in the Traditional Pension Plan  Prior to
January 1, 2000, for each month of Credited Service, a Participant will accrue a portion of the Participant s projected Gross Pension at the Participant s Normal Retirement Date. Subject to the limitations in Appendix B, Section B-2,
a Participant s Accrued Gross Pension is calculated as follows:      
   In computing the  Projected Gross Pension at Normal Retirement Date,  it will be assumed that the
Participant will continue to work for the Employer until the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, and that the Participant s Final Average Pay at such date will be equal to the Participant s Average Pay as of the date of the
computation. If the Participant works a Part-Time Schedule as of the date of the computation, it will be assumed that the Participant will continue to work a Part-Time Schedule until the Participant s Normal Retirement Date for purposes of the
computation.  
      C-12  

The  Accrued Gross Pension as of 12/31/75  is equal to the greater of A or B below:
   - A -      
   2  
 OR    - B -  
   
   In computing the  Projected Gross Pension as of 12/31/75 , it will be assumed that the Participant
will continue to work for the Employer until the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, and that the Participant s Final Average Pay at the Participant s Normal Retirement Date will be equal to the Participant s Average Pay as of
12/31/75.     Minimum Pension Payment: Generally  Prior to January 1, 2000, if as of the Participant s Benefit
Commencement Date, the Participant s Gross Pension is less than the Participant s Accrued Gross Pension reduced in accordance with the adjustments set forth in 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), the Participant s pension payments will be based on the
adjusted Accrued Gross Pension.  
      C-13  

C-13  Targeted Voluntary Special Early Retirement Program  Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary, certain Participants who meet the conditions set forth in the next sentence are eligible for an enhanced Plan benefit described below, if as of May 31, 2000 they are age 55 or older with at
least ten years of Credited Service. The conditions such Participants must meet are as follows: (1) on January 14, 2000, the Participant is an Employee of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company in a job or skill group in the Utility Operations
Group (UOG) that has been identified by UOG management for reduction; (2) the Participant receives a written notification from UOG management that his/her job or skill group has been identified for such reduction; (3) the Participant makes
an election on or after March 1, 2000 and on or before April 14, 2000 to voluntarily retire on June 1, 2000, and such election shall be irrevocable effective April 14, 2000; (4) the Participant executes (and does not
subsequently revoke) in writing and submits to the Plan Administrator, in the form, manner, and subject to the timing established by the Plan Administrator, an agreement releasing legal claims, including those against the Company and its
subsidiaries/affiliates, including but not limited to claims arising out of his/her employment with the Employer or termination of such employment; and (5) the Participant is not eligible for the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan.
    Traditional Pension Plan :    For
purposes of this C-13, the enhanced benefit for eligible Participants is determined based on the calculation of the Gross Pension of a Participant entitled to Early Retirement as set forth under 3.3(b), except that the Early Retirement Adjustment
Factor shall be computed as follows:    The Early Retirement Adjustment Factor for Participants in the Traditional Pension Plan with a
Benefit Commencement Date that is on or after the date that the  
      C-14  

Participant attains age 60, is 100 percent. For Participants with a Benefit Commencement Date that is on or after the date that the Participant attains age 55 but before the date that the
Participant attains age 60, the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor is 100 percent less 1/4 of one percent for each month that the Participant is less than age 60 on the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date; provided, however, that for a
Participant with at least 35 years of Credited Service as of his/her Severance From Service Date, the Early Retirement Adjustment Factor is 100 percent less 1/4 of one percent for each month that the Participant is less than age 57 on the
Participant s Benefit Commencement Date. For purposes of this calculation, the month of the Participant s 55th, 57th and 60th birthdays, as appropriate, is excluded.  
  PEP:     For purposes of this C-13, the
enhanced benefit for eligible PEP Participants is determined as follows:    The Gross Pension referenced in 3.3(e), 3.3(f) and 3.3(g) shall
be adjusted by computing Total Pension Credits assuming that on the Participant s Employment Commencement Date (or, if applicable, Adjusted Employment Commencement Date) and thereafter, the Participant s age is the Participant s
actual age plus five years.     Social Security Bridge :  
 In addition, the enhanced benefit for eligible Participants who have not attained age 62 as of June 1, 2000 will include an additional
monthly payment equal to one-half of the Participant s estimated monthly age 62 Social Security benefits computed assuming no earnings after 1999. The amount of such estimated age 62 Social Security benefits shall be requested from the Social
Security Administration by the Participant and  
      C-15  

furnished by the Participant to the Company and shall be final and not subject to challenge. The payments shall commence as of the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date and shall cease
effective at the earlier of (i) when the Participant is first eligible to receive reduced old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, or (ii) upon the Participant s death. The payments shall not be subject to
the Post-retirement Survivor Annuity or the Post-retirement Survivor Benefit provisions of Article V.    Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, if a Participant who is otherwise entitled to a monthly Social Security bridge payment fails to submit to the Employer by May 31, 2000, an original Social Security Administration Benefit Statement, then the amount of such monthly
payment shall be $200.    If a PEP Participant elects a lump sum form of payment pursuant to 3.3(e) of the Plan, then the Social Security
bridge payment will be payable in a lump sum as of the Benefit Commencement Date. The lump sum will equal the present value of the additional monthly Social Security bridge payments the Participant would otherwise receive. Such present value shall
be calculated based on the mortality table and interest rate described in Present Value as of the Benefit Commencement Date.     Generally:   
 Except as otherwise provided above, the amount of pension payments for Participants entitled to an enhanced benefit under this C-13 is computed
taking into account all other adjustments required under the terms of the Plan in the computation of pension payments. A Participant who commences payments under this C-13, and who is subsequently reemployed by the Employer will cease to receive
such payments and will be entitled to benefits under the Plan based on the provisions in effect at the time that the Participant subsequently retires.  
      C-16  

C-14  Voluntary Special Early Retirement Program  Notwithstanding any other provision
in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary, certain Participants who meet the conditions set forth in the next sentence, who under the terms of the Plan are eligible to commence Early Retirement as of February 1, 2002, and who voluntarily
elect to commence Early Retirement on February 1, 2002 (or such later date on or before July 1, 2002 as required in the sole discretion of management of the Employer) shall be entitled to an enhanced benefit. Applicable Participants are
Employees of the following Employers: Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (excluding Employees above the Co-President level), Constellation Energy Source, Inc., Constellation Investments, Inc., Constellation
Nuclear, LLC (CN) (excluding Employees above the Vice-President level), Constellation Nuclear Services, Inc. (CNS), Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Inc. (CCNPP), Constellation Power, Inc., Constellation Power Source, Inc., Constellation Power
Source Generation, Inc. (CPSG), and Constellation Power Source Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the Companies). The conditions such Participants must meet are as follows: (1) the Participant on November 1, 2001 is an active employee of one of
the Companies; (2) the Participant makes an election on or after: (a) November 1, 2001 and on or before December 16, 2001 for CPSG; (b) November 15 and on or before December 31, 2001 for CN, CNS and CCNPP; and
(c) November 26, 2001 and on or before December 31, 2001 for the remainder of the Companies, to voluntarily retire on February 1, 2001, and such election shall be irrevocable effective December 16, 2001 for CPSG, and
December 31, 2001 for the rest  
      C-17  

of the Companies; (3) the Participant executes (and does not subsequently revoke) in writing and submits to the Plan Administrator, in the form, manner, and subject to the timing established
by the Plan Administrator, an agreement releasing legal claims, including those against the Company and its subsidiaries/affiliates, including but not limited to claims arising out of his/her employment with the Employer or termination of such
employment; and (4) the Participant is not eligible for the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan or any other Employer severance plan or arrangement. In addition, Participants who are employees of BGE, CN, CNS, CCNPP or CPSG, and who
are involuntarily displaced in connection with a workforce reduction between December 17, 2001 for CPSG (January 2, 2002 for BGE, CN, CNS and CCNPP) and January 31, 2002 (February 28, 2002 for BGE), and who otherwise satisfy all of the
foregoing requirements and conditions (except under 2(a) above, December 16, 2001 is replaced with January 31, 2002, and under 2(b) above, December 31, 2001 is replaced with February 28, 2002, and under 2(c) above,
December 16, 2001 and December 31, 2001 are replaced with February 28, 2002), are also entitled to an enhanced benefit. Participants who satisfy the requirements and conditions set forth in the preceding sentences shall be entitled to
an enhanced benefit, subject to the Employer s right to limit benefits to the extent necessary to satisfy tax law limitations.    For
purposes of this C-14, the enhanced benefit for eligible Participants is determined based on the calculation of the Gross Pension of a Participant entitled to Early Retirement as set forth under the Plan, except that (1) the Participant s
regular unenhanced Gross Pension shall be computed using average base rate of pay computed as of February 1, 2002 or if later, the Participant s Severance From Service Date, whichever  
      C-18  

produces the highest amount, and using bonus and/or incentives (i) for purposes of determining Average Pay, that were earned (rather than paid) during the calendar years (a) 1999 and
2000 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such years) , or (b) for Participants retiring after March, 2002, if higher, 2000 and 2001 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such years); and (ii) for purposes of
determining Average Annual Pay, in accordance with the Plan provisions except that Annual Incentive Awards paid during all applicable prior years shall be included; and (2) the Participant shall also be entitled to an additional Gross Pension
amount under the Plan, computed as an immediate lump sum equal to: (a) the number of whole years of Credited Service ( i.e. , partial years of Credited Service are disregarded) multiplied by three, and (b) multiply the product in
(a) by the sum of (i) the base rate of pay on the Participant s Severance From Service Date determined as a weekly amount, plus (ii) bonuses and/or incentives (that have previously been approved in writing by the Administrative
Committee and the Chairman of the Board of Directors for inclusion in the computation of Average Annual Pay) that were earned during calendar years 1999 and 2000 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such calendar years), divided by 104.
   Such immediate lump sum amount shall also be available as an immediate annuity using the same formula set forth under Section 3.3(f)
of the Plan or as a deferred annuity using the same formula set forth under Section 3.3(g) of the Plan; provided, however, that any Participant in PEP who elects an immediate lump sum must make such election for his/her entire Gross Pension.
 
      C-19  

Except as otherwise provided above, the amount of pension payments for Participants entitled to
an enhanced benefit under this C-14 is computed taking into account all other adjustments required under the terms of the Plan in the computation of pension payments. The enhanced benefit does not accrue until the Participant makes an irrevocable
election to retire under the program; therefore, preretirement survivor annuity coverage is not available with respect to such enhanced benefit prior to such election. A Participant who commences payments under this C-14, and who is subsequently
reemployed by the Employer, will be entitled to benefits under the Plan based on the provisions in effect at the time that the Participant subsequently retires.  
 C-15  Voluntary Special Early Retirement Program  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan or any Appendix to the contrary,
certain Participants who meet the conditions set forth in the next sentence are eligible for Early Retirement if, between January 31, 2002 and February 28, 2002, they satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2 after substituting age 50
for age 55, and voluntarily elect to commence Early Retirement on March 1, 2002 (or such later date on or before July 1, 2002 as required in the sole discretion of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) or Constellation Power Source
Generation, Inc. (CPSG) management) shall be entitled to an enhanced benefit. The conditions such Participants must meet are as follows: (1) the Participant on January 2, 2002 is an employee of BGE (excluding manager- or executive-level
employees) or CPSG; (2) the Participant is at least age 50 and no older than age 54 with 20 or more years of service between January 31, 2002 and February 28, 2002; (3) the Participant makes an election on or after
January 2, 2002 and on or before February 15, 2002 to voluntarily retire on March 1, 2002, and such election shall be irrevocable effective February 15, 2002; (4) the Participant executes (and does not subsequently revoke)
in writing and submits to the Plan Administrator, in the form, manner, and subject to the  
      C-20  

timing established by the Plan Administrator, an agreement releasing legal claims, including those against the Company and its subsidiaries/affiliates, including but not limited to claims arising
out of his/her employment with the Employer or termination of such employment; and (5) the Participant is not eligible for the Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Severance Plan or any other Employer severance plan or arrangement. In addition,
Participants who are employees of CPSG, BGE, Constellation Energy Group, Inc., Constellation Investments, Inc., Constellation Power, Inc., Constellation Power Source, Inc., or Constellation Power Source Holdings, Inc., and who are involuntarily
displaced in connection with a workforce reduction between January 2, 2002 and February 28, 2002, and who otherwise satisfy all of the foregoing requirements and conditions (except under (3) above, February 15, 2002 is replaced
with February 28, 2002), are also entitled to an enhanced benefit. Participants who satisfy the requirements and conditions set forth in the preceding sentences shall be entitled to an enhanced benefit, subject to the Employer s right to
limit benefits to the extent necessary to satisfy tax law limitations.    For purposes of this C-15, the enhanced benefit for eligible
Participants is determined based on the calculation of the Gross Pension of a Participant entitled to Early Retirement as set forth under the Plan, except that (1) the Participant s regular unenhanced Gross Pension shall be computed using
average base rate of pay computed as of March 1, 2002 or if later, the Participant s Severance From Service Date, whichever produces the highest amount, and using bonus and/or incentives (i) for purposes of determining Average Pay,
that were earned (rather than paid) during the calendar years (a) 1999 and 2000 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such years), or (b) 
      C-21  

for Participants retiring after March 2002, if higher, 2000 and 2001 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such years); and (ii) for purposes of determining Average Annual Pay, in
accordance with the Plan provisions except that Annual Incentive Awards paid during all applicable prior years shall be included; and (2) the Participant shall also be entitled to an additional Gross Pension amount under the Plan, computed as
an immediate lump sum equal to: (a) the number of whole years of Credited Service ( i.e. , partial years of Credited Service are disregarded) multiplied by two, and (b) multiply the product in (a) by the sum of (i) the base
rate of pay on the Participant s Severance From Service Date determined as a weekly amount, plus (ii) bonuses and/or incentives (that have previously been approved in writing by the Administrative Committee and the Chairman of the Board of
Directors for inclusion in the computation of Average Annual Pay) that were earned during calendar years 1999 and 2000 (including Annual Incentive Awards earned during such calendar years), divided by 104.  
 Such immediate lump sum amount shall also be available as an immediate annuity using the same formula set forth under Section 3.3(f) of
the Plan or as a deferred annuity using the same formula set forth under Section 3.3(g) of the Plan; provided, however, that any Participant in PEP who elects an immediate lump sum must make such election for his/her entire Gross Pension. The
enhanced benefit for applicable participants shall also be computed by substituting age 50 for age 55 in Section A-20.    Except as
otherwise provided above, the amount of pension payments for Participants entitled to an enhanced benefit and under this C-15 is computed taking into account all other adjustments required under the terms of the Plan in the computation of pension
payments. The enhanced benefit does not accrue until the Participant makes an  
      C-22  

irrevocable election to retire under the program; therefore, preretirement survivor annuity coverage is not available with respect to such enhanced benefit prior to such election. A Participant
who commences payments under this C-15, and who is subsequently reemployed by the Employer, will be entitled to benefits under the Plan based on the provisions in effect at the time that the Participant subsequently retires.

APPENDIX D    
 TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS    D-1
 Purpose  If the Plan is or becomes top-heavy in any Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1983, the following provisions will supersede any conflicting provisions in the Plan.  
 D-2  Definitions  As used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is
clearly required by the context in which the term is used.    D-2.2   Anniversary Date   means December 31, the last day
of the Plan Year.    D-2.4   Key Employee   means any person who meets the requirements of Code Section 416(i), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein. For purposes of determining whether or not the Plan meets the requirements of Section D-3.2, the term Key Employee shall also include the
beneficiary of a Key Employee.    D-2.5   Permissive Aggregation Group   means all plans in the Required Aggregation Group
and any other Qualified Plans maintained by the Company, but only if such group of plans would satisfy, in the aggregate, the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410. The Plan Administrator shall determine which plan or plans shall be taken
into account in determining the Permissive Aggregation Group.    D-2.6   Qualified Plan   means any Plan which is qualified
under Code Section 401(a).  

D-2.7   Required Aggregation Group   means:  
 (a) Each Qualified Plan of the Company in which at least one Key Employee participates; and  
 (b) Any other Qualified Plan of the Company which enables a Plan described in Section D-2.7(a) to meet the requirements of Code
Section 401(a)(4) or 410.    D-2.8   Top-Heavy Plan   means the Plan, for any Plan Year in which the Plan meets the
requirements of Section D-3.2.    D-3  Top-Heavy Plan Requirements and Determination   
 D-3.1  Top Heavy Plan Requirements  For any Plan Year in which the Plan is determined to be a Top-Heavy Plan in accordance with
Section D-3.2, the Plan shall be subject to the following:    (a) special vesting requirements in D-4; and  
 (b) special minimum benefit requirements of D-4.  
 D-3.2  Top-Heavy Plan Determination   
 (a) The Plan shall be considered a Top-Heavy Plan and shall be subject to the additional requirements of Section D-3.1, with respect to any
Plan Year, if, as of the Anniversary Date of the preceding Plan Year (hereinafter referred to as the  determination date ), (i) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees in this Plan exceeds 60 percent of the present
value of the accrued benefits of all Employees in this Plan ( 60% Test  or (ii) the Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group and the sum of the present value of accrued benefits and the value of the aggregate accounts of Key
Employees in all plans in the Required Aggregation Group exceeds 60% of a similar sum for all Employees. For this purpose, the present value of accrued benefits and the value of the aggregate accounts shall be determined as of the valuation date for
the Plan Year that includes the determination date.  
      D - 2  

(b) For purposes of this Section D-3.2, the aggregate account of a Participant is determined
under applicable provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining whether the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan.    (c) For purposes
of this Section D-3.2, present value of accrued benefits shall be determined, in the case of a defined benefit pension plan, under the provisions of such a plan or plans and shall include any part of any accrued benefit distributed in the 5-year
period ending on the determination date. Effective January 1, 2002, the present value of accrued benefits shall include any part of any accrued benefit distributed in the 1-year period ending on the determination date, or, in the case of a
distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death or disability, during the 5-year period ending on the determination date.  
 (d) For purposes of this Section D-3.2, the present value of a participant s accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan shall be based
upon reasonable interest and mortality assumptions specified by the plan. The Top-Heavy calculations for this Plan shall be based on the same assumptions specified in the definition of Present Value in Section A-44. Where one or more defined benefit
plans are aggregated with this Plan for purposes of Top-Heavy calculations, the actuarial assumptions specified in the definition of Present Value in Section A-44 shall be applied to all plans in the aggregation group.  
 (e) For purposes of this Section D-3.2, the accrued benefit of a participant who is not a Key Employee shall be determined under the method,
if any, that uniformly applies for determining benefit accruals under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or if there is no such method, as if the benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the
fractional accrual rule of Section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.  
      D - 3  

(f) For purposes of this Section D-3.2, the accrued benefit of a participant in a plan who is not
a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year shall be disregarded.    (g) For purposes of this Section D-3.2, the accrued
benefits of all plan participants who have not performed services for any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the 5-year period (1-year period, effective January 1, 2002) ending on the determination date shall be disregarded.  
 (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) herein above, the Plan shall not be a Top-Heavy Plan, if the Plan Administrator
elects to treat the Plan as part of a Permissive Aggregation Group, and the Permissive Aggregation Group is not determined to be Top-Heavy using the criteria of the  60% Test  herein above.  
 (i) Where more than one plan is involved in the determination, only determination dates that fall within the same calendar year shall be
considered in order to determine whether the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.    (j) The provisions of Code section 416 and applicable regulations
are incorporated with respect to any additional requirements with respect to the determination as to how the top heavy ratio is computed.  
 D-4  Additional Top-Heavy Provisions  For purposes of determining whether or not the Plan meets the requirements of Section D-3.2,
the term  Participant  as defined in Appendix A, shall also include the beneficiary of a Participant.    Notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Plan if the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan:    (i) Each Participant who has at least three years of Vesting Service as of the
determination date will be fully vested in a pension benefit on the day following the determination date. Each Participant who subsequently accumulates at least three years of Vesting Service shall immediately be fully vested in such pension
benefit.  
      D - 4  

(ii) Each Participant who is not a Key Employee will be deemed to have an Gross Pension after the
determination date equal to 1/12 of the lesser of (A) 20% of such Participant s average compensation or (B) such average compensation multiplied by 2% for each year of Credited Service accumulated to the date of the calculation. For
purposes of this calculation, average compensation is the Participant s highest average compensation for the five consecutive years for which the Participant had the highest compensation. For purposes of this paragraph, compensation means
Section 415(c) Compensation. Effective January 1, 2002, in determining service for purposes of this minimum benefit calculation, any service shall be disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a plan year when the Plan
benefits (within the meaning of Code section 410(b)) no Key Employee or former Key Employee.  
      D - 5

 (iv) The third sentence in the definition of Annuity Factor in Appendix A is not applicable unless the Participant transferred employment to
BGE Home Products   Services, Inc. after January 1, 2000, and was eligible for Early Retirement under 2.2 at the time he/she was employed by the Company or a subsidiary listed in this Appendix G other than BGE Home Products   Services, Inc.
or BGE Commercial Building Systems, Inc.  

2   
   a. An individual who is a Participant on December 31, 1999 and an Employee of BGE Commercial Building Systems, Inc. on January 1, 2000, is subject to 1.2 of
the Plan except that PEP is modified as described in b. below. An individual who is a Participant in the Traditional Pension Plan after December 31, 1999 by reason of the preceding sentence will cease participating in the Traditional Plan once
he/she ceases to earn Credited Service. If such an individual again earns Credited Service, he/she shall participate in PEP as modified in b. below. All other individuals shall participate in PEP as modified in b. below.    
 b. Participants who are Employees of BGE Commercial Building Systems, Inc. shall have the following modifications to PEP:  
 (i) A Participant s Total Pension Credits in Appendix A for the period of time during which the Participant is employed by BGE Commercial
Building Systems, Inc. shall equal the sum of (1) 0.025 times the Credited Service earned in each Plan Year prior to the Plan Year in which the Participant reaches age 40, (2) 0.05 times the Credited Service earned in each Plan Year after
the Plan Year in which the Participant reaches age 39 and before the Plan Year in which the Participant reaches age 50, and (3) 0.075 times the Credited Service earned in each Plan Year after the Participant reaches age 49.  
 (ii) The only form of pension payments that a Participant may elect under PEP pursuant to 3.1(b) is monthly installments; lump sum payment is

shall be given written notice of the officer s final decision. If the officer determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 60-day
period and in no event shall such an extension exceed 60 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the officer expects to render the determination on review. The review
of the officer shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit

Administrator shall be in doubt as to whether payments are being received by the person entitled thereto, it shall, by registered mail addressed to the person concerned at his or her last address known to the Administrator, notify such person that

adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the

would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary
amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater responsibility and, provided further, that no
amendment shall be made that is not consistent with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Any such amendment or modification shall become effective on such date as the Board (or committee thereof) or executive shall determine and may apply
to Participants in this Plan at the time thereof as well as to future Participants, provided, however, that, unless permitted by applicable law, no such amendment or modification which reduces the basis for the computation of benefits shall be
retroactive as to service prior to the date of such amendment or modification.    9.2  Termination   
 9.2(a)  Termination of the Plan by an Employer . The Company may at any time, by resolution adopted by its board of
directors, terminate this Plan in its entirety. In addition, any Employer may at any time terminate its participation in this Plan by resolution adopted by its board of directors to that effect. Contributions of an Employer to the Plan are
conditioned on the receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of an initial favorable determination letter that this Plan and the Trust as adopted by the Company meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust is exempt from
tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and if the Internal Revenue Service shall refuse to issue such letter, any Employer may terminate its participation in this Plan and direct the Trustee to pay and deliver to that Employer the portion of the
Trust applicable to its contributions.    9.2(b)  Vesting and Distribution Upon Termination or Partial Termination .
Upon termination or partial termination of the Plan, the benefit as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case may be, of all affected Participants shall be fully vested; provided, however, that full vesting shall be required
with respect to a termination or partial termination only to the extent the Plan is then funded.  
      14  

Allocation and distribution of the terminated portion of the Trust Fund shall thereafter be made
in accordance with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and with any applicable approval of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the  PBGC ). If the Administrator is notified by PBGC that PBGC is unable to determine that
the Trust Fund is sufficient to discharge when due all obligations of the Plan with respect to benefits guaranteed by PBGC pursuant to section 4022 of ERISA, then the allocation and distribution of such portion of the Trust shall be made only under
the direction of PBGC or a United States district court pursuant to section 4044 of ERISA.    In the event that, after the termination of the
Plan, any assets remain after such allocation, such assets shall be paid to the Company. The portion of the assets allocated to provide benefits to any person or group of persons may be applied for the benefit of such person or persons by the
distribution of cash, continuance of the Trust, establishment of a new Trust, purchase of annuities from an insurance company, or otherwise, as determined by the Investment Fiduciary in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the benefit of any
Participant or former Participant who is married and has satisfied the vesting requirement shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth in the Plan relating to manner of distribution with respect to married
Participants and, if the surviving Spouse of a deceased Participant or deceased former Participant is entitled to receive a benefit pursuant to the Plan provisions relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants or to
pre-retirement death benefits, as the case may be, such benefit shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth therein.

letter that the Plan and Trust Fund as adopted by the Company meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and, in the event that the Internal Revenue Service shall
refuse to issue such letter, the Company may terminate the Plan and shall direct the Trustee to pay and deliver the Trust to the Company.

 WHEREAS, Exelon Corporation (the  Company ) sponsors the Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Amended and Restated
Effective January 31, 2012) (the  Plan  and    WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan to reflect additional
guidance issued with respect to Section 436 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to clarify the definition of  highly compensated employee  applicable under the Plan, to clarify the benefit formula for rehired employees,
to limit participation in the Plan on and after January 1, 2013 and to make certain other changes.    NOW, THEREFORE, RESOLVED, that
pursuant to the power of amendment contained in Article IX of the Plan, the Plan is amended effective January 1, 2013, except as otherwise stated below, as follows:  
 1. Section 1.1 of the Plan is amended to read as follows:  
 1.1  Automatic PEP Participation  Except as provided in 1.2 and the last sentence below, each Full-Time Employee of
the Company, or of those subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company which are designated by the Board of Directors (as reflected in Appendix G), shall become a Participant in PEP on the date he/she becomes a Full-Time Employee. (Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, effective July 23, 2010, Executive Group may designate such subsidiaries and affiliates if such designations have less than a $10 million impact on the Plan s accumulated benefit obligation per designation. At least
annually, the Company s Chief Executive Officer shall report all such subsidiary and affiliate designations to the Board of Directors.) In addition, each Employee who is reemployed as a Full-Time Employee of the Company, or those subsidiaries
and affiliates of the Company which are designated by the Board of Directors shall become a Participant in PEP on the date of his/her Adjusted Employment Commencement Date and shall not be eligible to participant in the Traditional Pension Plan with
respect to his/her period of reemployment. An Employee  

classified in a job description as an On-Call Employee, a leased employee within the meaning of Code Section 414(n)(2), or a co-op, work study or summer Employee shall not become a
Participant in the Plan while classified in the sole judgment of the Employer as an On-Call Employee, a leased employee, or a co-op, work study or summer Employee. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Employee whose
Employment Commencement Date is on or after January 1, 2013 shall be eligible to participate in the Plan, with the exception of an Employee employed by BGE Home Products   Services, LLC.  
 2. Section 1.2 of the Plan is amended by adding the following new sentence at the end thereof:  
 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Participant who is reemployed as an Employee shall not be a Participant in the
Traditional Pension Plan, and shall not accrue any benefits under the Traditional Pension Plan, with respect to his/her period of reemployment. The Participant s Gross Pension under the Traditional Pension Plan shall be computed based solely on
such Participant s Credited Service and Average Pay during the Employee s period of participation in the Traditional Pension Plan.  
 3. The second and third sentences of Section 3.2(d) of the Plan are amended to read as follows:  
 Except as provided in 3.2(e), monthly pension payments shall cease upon the Employer s reemployment of a Participant as an Employee. If
the Participant s monthly pension payments cease as provided in the preceding sentence, upon the Participant s subsequent termination of employment with the Employer, the Participant s Gross Pension shall be recalculated and adjusted
(including the adjustment described in 3.4(a)) and the Participant shall be given a new election with respect to the form and timing of his/her pension payments if such election otherwise would be available to the Participant  
 4. Section 3.2 of the Plan is amended by inserting the following new paragraph (e) at the end thereof:  
 3.2(e)  Continued Payment of Benefits for Certain Rehired Participants . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the

termination of employment and such Participant shall not have an Adjusted Employment Commencement Date for purposes of the Plan.  
      2  

5. The first sentence of Section 3.4(a) of the Plan is amended to read as follows:  
 The provisions of this 3.4(a) apply if, as described in 3.2(d), monthly pension payments cease upon the Employer s reemployment of a
Participant as an Employee, and the Participant s Gross Pension is required to be recalculated and adjusted upon the Participant s subsequent termination of employment with the Employer.  
 6. A new Section 8.13 shall be added immediately following Section 8.12 as follows:  
 8.13  Definition of Highly Compensated Employee for Purposes of Legal Requirements . Wherever applicable for purposes of
satisfying legal requirements applicable to the Plan, the term  highly compensated employee  shall mean any Employee who performs service in the determination year and who (a) is a 5%-owner (as determined under section
416(i)(1)(A)(iii) of the Code) at any time during the Plan Year or the preceding Plan Year or (b) both (1) is paid compensation in excess of $80,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section
414(q)(1)(B)(ii) of the Code) from an Employer for the preceding Plan Year, and (2) is in the group of employees consisting of the top 20% of the employees of the Employer and its affiliates when ranked on the basis of compensation paid during
such preceding Plan Year.    7. Appendix A-35 of the Plan is amended by replacing the last sentence thereof with the following new sentence:
   No Employee whose Employment Commencement Date is on or after January 1, 2013 shall be a Participant, with the exception of an
Employee employed by BGE Home Products   Services, LLC.    8. Effective January 1, 2010, a new Appendix B-4 shall be added
immediately following Appendix B-3 as follows:    B-4  Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding   
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage is at or below the following levels.  
      3  

(a)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan s Adjusted Funding Target
Attainment Percentage Is Less Than 80%, But Not Less Than 60% . If the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less than 80% (or would be less than 80% to the extent described in subparagraph (a) 2.
below) but is not less than 60%, then the limitations set forth in this paragraph (a) apply    1.  50% Limitation on
Single Sum Payments, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments . A Participant or Alternate Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a lump sum distribution or other optional form of
distribution that includes a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, and the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay
benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment, unless the present value of the portion of the benefit that is being paid in a prohibited payment does not exceed the lesser of:  

(i) 
 50% of the present value of the benefit payable in the optional form of benefit that includes the prohibited payment; or        

(ii) 
 100% of the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount (as defined in Section 1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(C) of the Treasury Regulations).    
 The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (a) 1. does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under
Section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant. If an optional form of benefit that is otherwise available under the terms of the Plan is not available to a Participant or Alternate
Beneficiary as of the annuity starting date because of the application of the requirements of this subparagraph (a) 1., the Participant or Alternate Beneficiary is permitted to elect to bifurcate the benefit into unrestricted and restricted
portions (as described in Section 1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations). The Participant or Alternate Beneficiary may also elect any other optional form of benefit otherwise available under the Plan at that annuity starting date
that would satisfy the 50% limitation described in subparagraph (a) 1. (i) above or the PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount described in subparagraph (a) 1. (ii) above, or may elect to defer the benefit in accordance with any
general right to defer commencement of benefits under the Plan.    2.  Plan Amendments Increasing Liability for
Benefits . No amendment to the Plan that has the effect of increasing liabilities of the Plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become
nonforfeitable shall take effect in a Plan Year if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:      
 
      4  

(ii) 
 80% or more, but would be less than 80% if the benefits attributable to the amendment were taken into account in determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.    
 The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (a) 2. does not apply to any amendment to the Plan that provides a benefit increase under a
Plan formula that is not based on compensation, provided that the rate of such increase does not exceed the contemporaneous rate of increase in the average wages of Participants covered by the amendment.  
 (b)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan s Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage Is Less Than 60% . If the
Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less than 60% (or would be less than 60% to the extent described in subparagraph (b) 2. below), then the limitations in this paragraph (b) apply.  
 1.  Single Sums, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments Not Permitted . A Participant or
Alternate Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement
date, and the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment. The limitation set forth in this subparagraph (b) 1. does
not apply to any payment of a benefit which under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.  
 2.  Shutdown Benefits and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits Not Permitted to Be Paid . An unpredictable
contingent event benefit with respect to an unpredictable contingent event occurring during a Plan Year shall not be paid if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:  

(ii) 
 60% or more, but would be less than 60% if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage were redetermined applying an actuarial assumption that the likelihood of occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event
during the Plan Year is 100%.      3.  Benefit Accruals Frozen . Benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease
as of the applicable section 436 measurement date. In addition, if the Plan is required to cease benefit accruals under this subparagraph (b) 3., then the Plan is not permitted to be amended in a manner that would increase the liabilities of
the Plan by reason of an increase in benefits or establishment of new benefits.  
      5  

(c)  Limitations Applicable If the Plan Sponsor Is In Bankruptcy .
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, a Participant or Alternate Beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that includes a prohibited payment with an annuity
starting date that occurs during any period in which the Plan sponsor is a debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or state law, except for payments made within a Plan Year with an annuity starting date that occurs on
or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that Plan Year is not less than 100%. In addition, during such period in which the Plan sponsor is a debtor
in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or state law, the Plan shall not make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited
payment, except for payments that occur on a date within a Plan Year that is on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan s adjusted funding target attainment percentage for that Plan Year is not less
than 100%. The limitation set forth in this paragraph (c) does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under Section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.  
 (d)  Provisions Applicable After Limitations Cease to Apply .  
 1.  Resumption of Prohibited Payments . If a limitation on prohibited payments under subparagraph (a) 1.,
(b) 1., or (c) of this Section applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limit no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefits with annuity
starting dates that are on or after that later section 436 measurement date.    2.  Resumption of Benefit Accruals . If
a limitation on benefit accruals under subparagraph (b) 3. of this Section applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limitation no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section 436 measurement date, then benefit
accruals shall resume prospectively and that limitation does not apply to benefit accruals that are based on service on or after that later section 436 measurement date, except as otherwise provided under the Plan. The Plan shall comply with the
rules relating to partial years of participation and the prohibition on double proration under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2530.204-2(c) and (d).  
 3.  Shutdown and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits . If an unpredictable contingent event benefit with respect
to an unpredictable contingent event that occurs during the Plan Year is not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the event because of the limitation of subparagraph (b) 2. of this Section, but is permitted to be paid later in the same
Plan Year (as a result of additional contributions or pursuant to the enrolled actuary s certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan  
      6  

Year that meets the requirements of Section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), then that unpredictable contingent event benefit shall be paid, retroactive to the period that
benefit would have been payable under the terms of the Plan (determined without regard to subparagraph (b) 2. of this Section). If the unpredictable contingent event benefit does not become payable during the Plan Year in accordance with the
preceding sentence, then the Plan is treated as if it does not provide for that benefit.    4.  Treatment of Plan
Amendments That Do Not Take Effect . If a Plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective date of the amendment because of the limitation of subparagraph (a) 2. or (b) 3. of this Section, but is permitted to take effect later in
the same Plan Year (as a result of additional contributions or pursuant to the enrolled actuary s certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year that meets the requirements of
Section 1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(C) of the Treasury Regulations), then the Plan amendment must automatically take effect as of the first day of the Plan Year (or, if later, the original effective date of the amendment). If the Plan amendment cannot
take effect during the same Plan Year, then it shall be treated as if it were never adopted, unless the Plan amendment provides otherwise.  
 (e)  Notice Requirement . Written notice to Participants and Beneficiaries shall be provided within 30 days, in accordance
with Section 101(j) of ERISA, if the Plan becomes subject to a limitation described in subparagraph (a) 1., (b), or (c) of this Section.  
 (f)  Methods to Avoid or Terminate Benefit Limitations . Application of one or more of the benefit limitations set forth
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section for a Plan Year may be avoided or terminated through the use of employer contributions, by increasing the amount of Plan assets which are taken into account in determining the adjusted funding
target attainment percentage and by other methods in accordance with Sections 436(b)(2), (c)(2), (e)(2) and (f) of the Code and Section 1.436-1(f) of the Treasury Regulations.

CONSTELLATION ENERGY GROUP, INC.   
  EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN      Article I  
Purpose and Nature of the Plan       
   The Plan is designed as a stock bonus plan. Eligible Employees have
the opportunity to save on a regular and long-term basis, and in the process acquire or sustain a proprietary interest in the success of the Company. The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of the provisions of Code Section 401(a). The
Plan is also intended to meet the requirements of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan under Code Section 4975(e)(7) as well through February 28, 2002. Effective February 1, 2006, the portion of the Plan consisting of the CEG Common Stock
Fund is intended to be an Employee Stock Ownership Plan under Code Section 4975(e)(7). That portion of the Plan is intended to be primarily invested in Common Stock which constitutes employer securities (within the meaning of Code
Section 409(l).      

1.2  
  Nature of the Plan   General       The Plan is structured to permit three
(3) general categories of Employee participation. First, eligible Employees may elect to participate by choosing to contribute to the Plan under the After-Tax Option, the Before-Tax Option, or a combination of both. Company Matching
Contributions, as provided under the Plan, are made with respect to a Participant s contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options. Second, eligible Employees may elect to participate by contributing to the Plan through the
rollover of an Eligible Rollover Distribution from an Eligible Retirement Plan as provided under the rollover provisions of the Plan. Third, Employees or former Employees may participate by virtue of having a balance established in an Employee Stock
Account.  

1.3  
  After-Tax and Before-Tax Options         
   Under the After-Tax Option, an eligible Employee may
contribute a percentage of Eligible Compensation to the Plan through payroll deduction, subject to the limitations of Articles III and IV and Appendix B of the Plan. Amounts contributed under the After-Tax Option are contributions described in Code
Section 401(m) and are included in the taxable income of the Employee in the year of the contribution. Earnings on After-Tax Option contributions are taxed to the Employee when distributed or withdrawn from the Plan.  
   
   Under the Before-Tax Option, an eligible Employee may contribute a
percentage of Eligible Compensation to the Plan through payroll deduction, subject to the limitations of Articles III and IV and Appendix B of the Plan. Amounts contributed under the Before-Tax Option are contributions described in Code
Section 401(k) and are not included in the federal taxable income of the Employee in the year of the contribution. Before-Tax Option contributions and earnings thereon are taxed to the Employee when distributed or withdrawn from the Plan.  

1.3(c)  
  Company Matching Contributions       Under the Company Matching Contribution provisions of
the Plan, the Company contributes a Company Matching Contribution with respect to each eligible Employee, subject to the limitations of Articles III and IV and Appendix B of the Plan. Company Matching Contributions are contributions described in
Code Section 401(m) and are not included in the taxable income of the Employee in the year of the contribution. Company Matching Contributions and earnings thereon are taxed to the Employee when distributed or withdrawn from the Plan.  
      2  

Under the rollover provisions of the Plan, an eligible Employee may establish
a Rollover Account within the Plan by transferring all or a portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution (except any portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income unless specifically provided for under Section 3.3) from
another Eligible Retirement Plan. Such transfers can only be in the form of cash, except as otherwise provided in Appendix E or under Section 3.3.      

1.5  
  Employee Stock Account       An Employee Stock Account was automatically established within
the Plan for each Employee or former Employee upon the Plan s receipt of (i) Baltimore Gas and Electric Company contributions made on behalf of such Employee under the Corporate Performance Award Program, and/or (ii) transfers of the
Employee s or former Employee s account balance in the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan upon such plan s Termination.      
   The following plans (or portions thereof) have been merged into this Plan
as of the corresponding effective dates:      
 
      3  

Article II   Eligibility and Participation   

2.1(a)  
  Eligibility In General       Each Full-Time Employee of the Company, or of those other
Employers which are designated as Participating Employers by the Designating Authority, as reflected in Appendix E, is eligible to become a Participant in the Plan through the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options and/or rollover provisions beginning on
the first day of the first pay period as soon as practicable following his date of hire by a Participating Employer; provided, however, that any person whose conditions of employment are covered by any collective bargaining agreement to which the
Employer is a party shall be ineligible to become a Participant unless and until that agreement specifically provides for such person s participation in the Plan. Each such Full-Time Employee of a Participating Employer is eligible to become a
Participant only in those aspects of the Plan specified by the Designating Authority.    An Employee classified in a job description as an
On-Call Employee or an Employee who is a leased employee within the meaning of Code Sections 414(n)(2) and 414(o)(2), is not eligible to participate in the Plan while classified in the sole judgment of the Employer as an On-Call Employee or leased
employee.      

2.1(b)  
  Eligibility After Reemployment       If an Employee who terminated service is reemployed as a
Full-Time Employee of the Company or another Participating Employer, as reflected in Appendix E, the Employee shall be eligible to participate through the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options and/or rollover provisions beginning on the first day of the
first pay period as soon as practicable following his date of reemployment. This reemployment rule applies whether the Employee was a Participant, was eligible to be a Participant, or was ineligible to be a Participant due to failure to meet the
Plan s service requirement for eligibility, on the date of termination.  
      4  

An Employee who becomes represented by a collective bargaining
agreement with the Employer shall have the accounts maintained under this Plan transferred to the plan established pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement as soon as administratively feasible.  
 An Employee who ceases to be represented by a collective bargaining agreement with the Employer shall become eligible to participate in the
Plan, and the accounts maintained under the plan established pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement shall be transferred to the Plan as soon as administratively feasible. Such an Employee shall become a Participant in the Plan as of the
date of such transfer and shall be eligible to make contributions to the Plan in accordance with Article III of the Plan as soon as administratively feasible      

2.2(a)  
  After-Tax and Before-Tax Options       Participation in the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options
is voluntary. An Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of Section 2.1 can elect to become a Participant by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. In making the Appropriate Request, the Employee must
(i) designate the rate of contribution under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options; (ii) indicate the Investment Funds to which contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options will be allocated and the percentage allocated to
each Investment Fund; and (iii) agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, a copy of which will be furnished to the Employee upon request.  
      5  

After-Tax Option contributions, which are taxed to the Participant when contributed to the Plan,
are treated as direct contributions to the Plan by the Participant. Therefore, an Appropriate Request submitted with respect to the After-Tax Option authorizes the Company to deduct a stated percentage of the Participant s Eligible Compensation
from his pay and transmit the amount deducted to the Plan to be invested.    Before-Tax Option contributions, which are not taxed to the
Participant (for federal income tax purposes) until distributed from the Plan, are treated as reductions in the salary of the Participant which are then contributed to the Plan by the Company on behalf of the Participant. Therefore, pursuant to an
Appropriate Request submitted with respect to the Before-Tax Option, the Participant undertakes to forego the receipt of a stated percentage of Eligible Compensation. In return, the Company will contribute to the Plan an amount equal to the
deferral.    An eligible Employee who does not elect to become a Participant in the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options at the earliest
possible eligibility date as provided in Section 2.1, may elect to become a Participant at a later date by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. The election to participate will become effective beginning on the first
day of the first pay period as soon as practicable following the date on which the Appropriate Request is received by the Plan Administrator.      
   A Participant who satisfies the eligibility requirements of Section 2.1
and who wishes to roll over all or a portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution (except any portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income unless specifically allowed under Section 3.3) as provided in Section 3.3 may
do so by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. A Participant will continue to be considered a Participant for purposes of eligibility for rollovers as long as amounts are  
      6  

held in the Participant s Plan accounts, regardless of such Participant s eligibility to make further contributions to the Plan. The Participant will be required to submit documentation
necessary to support the qualification of the rollover as requested by the Plan Administrator, or designees of the Plan Administrator, before the Plan Administrator will authorize the establishment of a Rollover Account for the Participant. If, in
the judgment of the Plan Administrator or the Plan Administrator s designees, the documentation does not adequately support the qualification of the rollover amount, the Plan Administrator has the authority under the Plan to disallow a rollover
contribution to the Plan.    The Participant must indicate as part of the Appropriate Request the Investment Funds to which rollover
contributions will be allocated and the percentage or dollar amount allocated to each Investment Fund. The Participant must also agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, a copy of which will be furnished to the Employee upon
request.      

2.2(c)  
  Employee Stock Account       An Employee or former Employee for whom a balance in an Employee
Stock Account has been established under the Plan is automatically a Participant. Participation in the Plan through the establishment of an Employee Stock Account does not affect an Employee s eligibility for or participation in the After-Tax
and Before-Tax Options or the rollover provision.  
      7  

Article III   Contributions to the Plan   

3.1  
  After-Tax and Before-Tax Options         

3.1(a)  
  Rate of Contribution       Subject to the limitations described in Article IV and Appendix B,
a Participant may contribute to the After-Tax Option of the Plan an amount equal to not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the Participant s Eligible Compensation, and to the Before-Tax Option of the Plan an amount equal to not more than
fifty percent (50%) of the Participant s Eligible Compensation; provided, however, that a Participant may contribute to the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options of the Plan an amount equal in aggregate to not more than fifty (50%) of
the Participant s Eligible Compensation.    Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan including the above, Participants who have
attained age 50 before the close of the Plan Year are eligible to make  catch-up contributions  in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, Section 414(v) of the Code. Such catch-up contributions shall be treated for
purposes of the Plan as Before-Tax Option contributions, but shall not be subject to the Company Matching Contribution provisions, and shall not be taken into account for purposes of the required limitations of Sections 402(g) and 415 of the Code.
The Plan will not be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of the Plan implementing the requirements of Sections 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 410(b), or 416 of the Code, as applicable, by reason of the making of such catch-up
contributions.    The rate of contribution must be in multiples of one percent (1%); provided, however, that  catch-up
contributions  must be in a specified dollar amount per pay period. In the event a Participant s Compensation in any Payroll Period is insufficient to make contributions at the rate elected by the Participant, the amount not contributed as
a result of the insufficiency may not be contributed in the succeeding Payroll Period(s). A Participant s contributions shall be paid into the Plan as soon as practicable and shall be allocated to the Participant Contribution Account(s) in
accordance with the Participant s instructions as indicated by the Appropriate Request submitted with the Plan Administrator.  
      8  

3.1(b)  
  Basic and Supplemental Contributions Under the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options       For
purposes of determining the Company Matching Contributions as well as for various withdrawal and loan provisions found in Articles VII and IX of the Plan, a Participant s contributions made through the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options are
characterized as either Basic Contributions or Supplemental Contributions.    When, in accordance with a Participant s instructions,
the total contribution is split in whole percentage points between the After-Tax and the Before-Tax Options, the contribution under the Before-Tax Option, up to and including the maximum amount permitted as a Basic Contribution, will be treated as a
Basic Contribution. Should the contribution under the Before-Tax Option be less than the maximum amount permitted as a Basic Contribution, then a portion of the After-Tax Option contribution percentage (if any) equal to the difference between the
Before-Tax Option contribution percentage and the maximum amount permitted as a Basic Contribution will be characterized as a Basic Contribution.      

3.1(c)  
  Change in Rate of Contribution       A Participant may elect to change his contribution rate
in multiples of one percent (1%), or in such other multiples as may be specified by the Plan Administrator, by submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator. Unless otherwise specified by the Plan Administrator, the change in the rate
of contribution will become effective the first day of the first pay period as soon as practicable following the date on which the Appropriate Request is received by the Plan Administrator.  
      9  

3.1(d)  
  Suspension of Participant Contributions       A Participant may elect to suspend his
contributions to the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options of the Plan by submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator. The suspension of contributions shall become effective the first day of the first pay period as soon as practicable
following the date on which the Appropriate Request is received by the Plan Administrator. A Participant may also elect to resume contributions by submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator. Such a Participant s contributions
will resume on the first day of the first pay period as soon as practicable following the date on which the Appropriate Request is received by the Plan Administrator. A Participant may not make up contributions relating to the period in which
contributions were suspended.      
   An authorized leave of absence shall not constitute a termination of
employment, but shall, except as provided in Section 3.1(f), operate to suspend Participant contributions and related Company Matching Contributions. At the end of an authorized leave of absence, a Participant s After-Tax and/or Before-Tax
Option contributions shall be automatically restarted based on the Participant s contribution election at the time the leave of absence began.      

3.1(f)  
  Military Leave of Absence       In accordance with the provisions of the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, an Employee returning from a military leave of absence may elect to contribute to the Plan, under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options, an amount not to exceed the amount such Employee would have
been permitted to contribute had the Employee not taken a military leave of absence. The election to make a contribution for the period of the military leave of absence is made by filing an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator.
Contributions under this Section must  
      10  

be made in accordance with Code Section 414(u). At the time such contribution is made, the Employee must (i) designate the portion of the contribution made under the After-Tax and/or
Before-Tax Options, and (ii) indicate the Investment Funds to which contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options shall be allocated. A Company Matching Contribution will be made in accordance with Section 3.2 on the portion
of the Employee contribution that represents Basic Contributions. Any contribution to the Plan under this Section must be made during the period beginning with the date of return from the leave of absence and whose duration is three times the period
of the Employee s service in the uniformed services, not to exceed five years.    An individual receiving a differential wage payment,
as defined by Code Section 3401(h)(2) is treated as an Employee of the Employer. The differential wage payment is treated as Compensation, to the extent required under law, and the Plan is not treated as failing to meet the requirements of any
provision described in Code Section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage payment. This paragraph applies only if the requirements of Code Section 414(u)(12)(B) and (C) are
satisfied.      

3.2  
  Company Matching Contributions       Subject to the limitations described in Article IV and
Appendix B, the Company will contribute the Company Matching Contribution to the Plan on behalf of each Participant and as soon as practicable.  
 Company Matching Contributions will be made completely in cash or in shares of Common Stock having an aggregate value equal to the
contribution the Company is required to make to the Plan under this Section 3.2. Prior to January 1, 2012, Company Matching Contributions are invested initially in the CEG Common Stock Fund. On and after January 1, 2012, Company
Matching Contributions are invested in the Investment Funds designated by the Participant.  
      11  

3.3  
  Rollover Contributions       A Participant may contribute to the Plan, in cash (or other
property as set forth in Appendix E or as set forth below), all or a portion of an amount determined to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution (except any portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income unless specifically allowed
below). A Participant who rolls over an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Employee Savings Plan for Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC and the Represented Employee Savings Plan of Nine Mile Point to the Plan may rollover shares of CEG
Common Stock in kind and may also rollover any promissory notes evidencing any loans under those plans in-kind. The Plan may accept a direct transfer of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that consists of after-tax employee contributions from the
Employee Savings Plan for Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC and the Represented Employee Savings Plan for Nine Mile Point, qualified plans, subject to any procedure established by the Plan. The Plan will account separately for any amounts so
transferred.    A Participant may execute a rollover to the Plan of an Eligible Rollover Distribution (including, without limitation, an
Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Group, Inc.) by either (i) contributing all or a portion of the distribution received by the Participant to the Plan within 60 days from the date the distribution is
received, or (ii) having the Eligible Retirement Plan from which the Eligible Rollover Distribution is to be made, transfer the Eligible Rollover Distribution directly to the Plan. The Plan Administrator may designate the manner in which a
direct transfer to the Plan can be made.    It is the intent of the Plan that any distribution eligible for rollover to the Plan meet the
tax-free rollover requirements as set forth in the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so that the amounts rolled over into the Plan will not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the Plan or Trust or result in adverse tax consequences to
the Company. The Plan Administrator may require the Employee to establish that amounts contributed to the Plan under the rollover provisions, meet the tax-free rollover requirements set forth in the Code.  
      12  

3.4  
  Return of Company Contributions       At the discretion of the Plan Administrator, in the
case of a Company contribution which is made under a mistake of fact, such contribution exclusive of earnings may be returned to the Company within one year after the payment of the contribution.  
 All Company contributions to the Plan shall be conditioned on their deductibility under Code Section 404 and, in the event the deduction
for the contributions is disallowed by the Secretary of the Treasury, such contributions will be returned to the Company within one year of the disallowance.  
      13  

Article IV   Limitations on Contributions to the Plan   
   
   In addition to the limitations on contributions imposed by the Plan under
Article III, and subject to the  catch-up contributions  provisions in Section 3.1(a), contributions to the Plan under the After-Tax Option, the Before-Tax Option, and the Company Matching Contribution provisions will be limited by
the Plan Administrator, to the extent necessary to enable the Plan to comply with the limitations prescribed by the Code. These limitations are summarized in Section 4.2 below and detailed in Appendix B.  

4.2  
  Internal Revenue Code Limitations       To determine that the limitations on contributions to
the Plan under the Code are not exceeded in any Plan Year, the following limitations will be monitored by the Plan Administrator or his designees no less frequently than annually.  

4.2(a)  
  Limitation on Participants  Before-Tax Option Contributions       Before-Tax Option
contributions on behalf of any Participant may not exceed the Code Section 402(g) limit ($13,000 in 2004 and as further adjusted under Code Section 402(g)(5)) for any Plan Year. The Plan Administrator may prospectively limit, during the
Plan Year, Before-Tax Option contributions if it is determined that the Code Section 402(g) limitation would otherwise be exceeded for such Plan Year. Participants whose Before-Tax Option contributions are limited under this Section 4.2(a)
are automatically treated as electing to increase their contributions under the After-Tax Option by an amount equal to the Participant s Before-Tax Option contribution percentage in excess of the limitation. If necessary, the Plan Administrator
may distribute any excess amounts to the Participant in a post-Plan Year distribution. Detailed provisions governing the operation of this limitation under the Plan are set forth in Appendix B-1:  Dollar Limitation on Participants  Before-Tax
Option Contributions .  
      14  

4.2(b)  
  Limitation on Total Annual Additions       The annual additions to a Participant s
account during the Plan Year resulting from After-Tax Option contributions, Before-Tax Option contributions, and Company Matching Contributions may not under Code Section 415(c) exceed the Code Section 415(c)(1) limit.  
 As used in this Section 4.2(b) and Appendix B-2, compensation means compensation under Code Section 415(c)(3), including any items
required to be included in compensation and excluding any items required to be excluded from compensation under Code Section 415(c)(3) and the regulations issued thereunder, and specifically incorporating the safe harbor definition of
compensation under Treas. Reg.   1.415(c)-2(d)(4) relating to information required to be reported under Code Sections 6041, 6051, and 6052. Any differential wage payments (as defined in Code Section 3401(h)(2)) shall be included in
compensation for purposes of Code Section 415. Payments made by the later of 2-1/2 months after severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance from employment are included in compensation for the
limitation year if, absent a severance from employment, such payments would have been paid to the Participant while the Participant continued in employment with the Employer and are regular compensation for services during the Participant s
regular working hours, compensation for services outside the Participant s regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar compensation.  
 Compensation as used in this section 4.2(b) and Appendix B-2 is not permitted to reflect compensation that is in excess of the limitation
under Code Section 401(a)(17) that applies to that limitation year.  
      15  

4.2(c)  
  Limitation on Participant Contributions Under the Before-Tax Option (ADP Test)       The
actual deferral percentage of eligible Highly Compensated Employees may not exceed the actual deferral percentage of eligible Nonhighly Compensated Employees by an amount greater than the limitations of the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) Test
under Code Section 401(k)(3). The Plan Administrator may prospectively limit, during the Plan Year, Before-Tax Option contributions of certain Highly Compensated Employees if it is determined that the ADP Test limitation would otherwise be
exceeded for such Plan Year. Participants whose Before-Tax Option contributions are prospectively limited under this Section 4.2(d) are automatically treated as electing to increase their contributions under the After-Tax Option by an amount
equal to the Participant s Before-Tax Option contribution percentage in excess of the limitation.    The Plan Administrator may also
correct any excess Before-Tax Option contributions by distributing the excess amounts applicable to such Highly Compensated Employees in a post-Plan Year distribution, by making a Qualified Nonelective Contribution, or by recharacterizing excess
amounts as After-Tax Option contributions. Detailed provisions governing the operation of this limitation under the Plan are set forth in Appendix B-4:  Limitation on Participant Contributions Under the Before-Tax Option (ADP Test ).  

4.2(d)  
  Limitation on After-Tax Option Contributions and Company Matching Contributions (ACP Test)     
 The actual contribution percentage of eligible Highly Compensated Employees may not exceed the actual contribution percentage of eligible
Nonhighly Compensated Employees by an amount greater than the limitations of the Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) Test under Code Section 401(m). The Plan  
      16  

Administrator may prospectively limit, during the Plan Year, After-Tax Option contributions or Company Matching Contributions of certain Highly Compensated Employees if it is determined that the
ACP Test limitation would otherwise be exceeded for such Plan Year. The Plan Administrator may also correct any excess After-Tax Option contributions or Company Matching Contributions by distributing the excess amounts to such Highly Compensated
Employees in a post-Plan Year distribution. Detailed provisions governing the operation of this limitation under the Plan are set forth in Appendix B-5:  Limitation on Participant Contributions Under the After-Tax Option and Company Matching
Contributions (ACP Test ).

Article V   Investment of Contributions and Determination of Account Balances   

5.1  
  Investment of Contributions         
   Contributions to the Plan will be invested in one or more of the
following Investment Funds under the Plan:      

(1) 
 the CEG Common Stock Fund;        

(2) 
 the Default Investment Fund; or        

(3) 
 any Other Investment Fund(s) selected by the Investment Committee from time to time.    
 Dividends, interest, or other income, if any, received by the Trustee with respect to contributions in each Investment Fund shall be
reinvested in the same Investment Fund, except to the extent distributed in accordance with Section 8.5(a).    In the event a
Participant fails to make any investment elections with respect to any Participant Contributions, rollover contributions and, for periods on or after January 1, 2012, Company Matching Contributions, the portion of the Participant s
accounts over which the Participant has not directed the investment shall first be invested in accordance with elections under the Before-Tax Option, then in elections under the After-Tax Option and then, if no elections are made under either the
Before-Tax or After-Tax Option, invested in the Default Investment Fund. Any material provided to the Plan relating to a Participant s investment in the Default Investment Fund as a default investment as described above, including account
statements, prospectuses and proxy voting material, will be provided to such Participant. The Default Fund is and has been intended to constitute a  qualified default investment alternative  as defined in DOL Reg. 2550.404c-5 and is
intended to meet all requirements necessary to satisfy applicable law.  
      18  

5.1(b)  
  Investment of Participant Contributions       A Participant s contributions to the Plan
under either the After-Tax Option or the Before-Tax Option, or under the rollover provisions of the Plan, shall be invested in one or more of the Investment Funds under the Plan, in accordance with instructions furnished to the Plan Administrator by
the Participant as provided under Article II. Participant contributions to the Plan shall be allocated to the Investment Funds in any increments of one percent (1%) of the total contribution or in any other increments at the discretion of the
Plan Administrator as selected by the Participant. A Participant may choose to invest contributions to the Plan under the After-Tax Option in the same different Investment Funds and at different percentages than contributions under the Before-Tax
Option. Likewise, contributions under the rollover provisions of the Plan are not required to be invested in the same Investment Funds or in the same percentages as Participant Contributions under the After-Tax and/or the Before-Tax Options.  
 With respect to After-Tax Option, Before-Tax Option, or rollover contributions held by the Company pending transfer to the Trustee, no
interest will be paid on such accumulated contributions prior to transfer to the Trustee. A Participant will not be able to withdraw under any circumstances monies contributed but not yet transferred to the Trustee.  
 Participant contributions shall be posted to Participants  accounts as soon as administrative feasible after such contributions are
transferred to the Trustee.      

5.1(c)  
  Change in Investment of Participant Contributions       A Participant may change investment
percentages for future contributions to the Investment Funds under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options within the limits set forth in Section 5.1(b). Investment percentages may be changed at any time, by submitting an Appropriate Request in
the form and manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator. The change will become effective as soon as administratively feasible.  
      19  

5.1(d)  
  Investment of Company Matching Contributions       Prior to January 1, 2012, all Company
Matching Contributions shall be initially invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund. Participants may elect to transfer these contributions to other Investment Funds as soon as these contributions have been posted to provide for diversification of the
Participant s investment pursuant to the interfund transfers provisions of Section 5.3(a).    Effective on and after
January 1, 2012, all Company Matching Contributions shall be invested in accordance with instructions furnished to the Plan Administrator by the Participant as provided under Article III and this Article V for contributions to the Plan under
the Before-Tax Option. Company Matching Contributions shall be posted as soon as administratively feasible after the date the contributions are transferred to the Trustee. Company Matching Contributions shall be allocated to the Investment Funds in
any increments of one percent (1%) of the total contribution or in any other increments at the discretion of the Plan Administrator as selected by the Participant.      

5.1(e)  
  Investment of Employee Stock Account       A Participant s Employee Stock Account
consists of Company contributions that were made under the Corporate Performance Award Program, amounts that were directly transferred by the Trustee of the terminated Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and earnings
thereon. All contributions, transfers, and earnings in the Employee Stock Account were initially invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund. As with Company Matching Contributions, Participants may elect to transfer these contributions to other
Investment Funds to provide for diversification of the Participant s investments pursuant to the interfund transfers provisions of Section 5.3(a).  
      20  

5.1(f)  
  Investment of Recharacterized Employee Contributions       Amounts contributed by a
Participant under the Before-Tax Option which are subsequently recharacterized as contributions under the After-Tax Option because the limitations under Section 4.2(d) are exceeded, shall remain invested in the same Investment Funds in which
such contributions were invested immediately prior to the recharacterization.      

5.1(g)  
  Investment of After-Tax Option Contributions Made Pursuant to   Automatic Provisions of Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.2(d)     
 Amounts contributed by a Participant under the After-Tax Option pursuant to the automatic provision contained in Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(d)
relating to prospective limitations, shall be invested in the same Investment Funds using the same investment percentages as elected by the Participant for other contributions being made under the After-Tax Option. Lacking instructions from the
Participant regarding investments under the After-Tax Option, such contributions shall be invested in the same Investment Funds using the same investment percentages elected by the Participant under the Before-Tax Option.  

5.2  
  Investment Fund Accounts         

5.2(a)  
  Participant Contribution Account       A Participant Contribution Account will be established
in each Investment Fund to which Participant Contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options are invested.      

5.2(b)  
  Company Matching Contribution Account       Prior to January 1, 2012, a Company Matching
Contribution Account will be established in the CEG Common Stock Fund for each Participant. This account will contain all Company Matching Contributions made on behalf of the Participant prior to January 1, 2012 with respect to Basic
Contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before -Tax Options.  
      21  

Company Matching Contribution Accounts will also be established in the Default Investment Fund
and the Other Investment Funds as elected by the Participant for Participants requesting transfer for amounts from the Company Matching Contribution Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund to other Investment Funds under the provisions of
Section 5.3(a) and for all Company Matching Contributions made on behalf of the Participant on and after January 1, 2012 with respect to Basic Contributions under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options.  

5.2(c)  
  Employee Stock Account       Contributions were made to an Employee Stock Account that was
established in the CEG Common Stock Fund on behalf of the Participant under the Corporate Performance Award Program. The Employee Stock Account also includes any amounts directly transferred by the Trustee of the terminated Baltimore Gas and
Electric Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan.    Dividends, if any, received by the Trustee (on or before the January 1, 2002 Common Stock dividend
payment date) with respect to amounts in the Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be distributed to Participants as provided in Section 8.5. The Trustee shall invest, no less frequently than quarterly, any interest earned
on such dividends prior to their distribution, in shares of Common Stock, and allocate such shares to the Participant s Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund. Employee Stock Accounts will also be established in the Default
Investment Fund and the Other Investment Funds for Participants requesting transfer of amounts from the Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund to other Investment Funds under the provisions of Section 5.3(a).  
      22  

A Rollover Account will be established in each Investment Fund to
which Participant rollover contributions under the rollover provisions of the Plan are invested in accordance with Participant instructions.      

5.3  
  Interfund Transfers         
   Upon submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator, a
Participant may elect to transfer from one Investment Fund to another, in whole or in part, in multiples of 1 percentage, whole number of shares or whole dollar amounts that have already been contributed by the Participant to the Plan under the
After-Tax Option, the Before-Tax Option, and/or the rollover provisions of the Plan, and by the Company to the Plan under the Company Matching Contribution Account and Employee Stock Account. Amounts may not be transferred between the Participant
Contribution Account, the Company Matching Contribution Account, the Employee Stock Account, or the Rollover Account. Amounts in the Participant Contribution Account, may not be transferred between the After-Tax Option and the Before-Tax Option. An
Appropriate Request for Investment Fund transfer may be submitted to the Plan Administrator at any time.      

5.3(b)  
  Valuation of Interfund Transfers       The value of the account balances transferred under
the interfund transfer provisions shall be determined in the following manner:    If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for an
interfund transfer  prior to  the close of the New York Stock Exchange, (i) transfers from the Default Investment Fund and/or the Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for the funds on the day the Appropriate
Request is received, (ii) transfers from the  
      23  

CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received, (iii) transfers to the Default Investment Fund and/or
the Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for the funds on the day the Appropriate Request is received, unless the transfer to such funds is from the CEG Common Stock Fund, in which case the value shall be the Closing
Price of the funds on the day the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock are received by the Trustee, and (iv) transfers to the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the next business day following the day
the Appropriate Request is received.    If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for an interfund transfer  on or after  the
close of the New York Stock Exchange, (i) transfers from the Default Investment Fund and/or the Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for the funds on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received,
(ii) transfers from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the second business day after the Appropriate Request is received, (iii) transfers to the Default Investment Fund and/or the Other Investment
Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for the funds on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received, unless the transfer to such funds is from the CEG Common Stock Fund, in which case, the value shall be the Closing
Price of the funds on the day the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock are received by the Trustee, and (iv) transfers to the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the second business day following the
day the Appropriate Request is received.  
      24  

The Company does not issue fractional shares of Common Stock.
However, to facilitate full investment of monies in the CEG Common Stock Fund, the Plan accounting system allocates fractional shares of Common Stock to Participants  accounts. Participants  fractional shares are aggregated so that only
whole shares are actually held by the Plan. The aggregate value of all Participants  whole and allocated fractional shares will not exceed the value of the sum of the shares and cash held by the CEG Common Stock Fund.  
      25  

Article VI   Vesting       

6.1  
  Participant Contributions       A Participant is 100% vested at all times with respect to
amounts in his Participant Contribution Accounts and Rollover Accounts.      

6.2  
  Company Contributions       A Participant is 100% vested at all times with respect to amounts
in his Company Matching Contribution Accounts and Employee Stock Accounts.      

6.3  
  Participant s Election to Use Pre-Amendment Vesting Schedule       In the event the Plan
is amended to change or modify the Plan s vesting schedule, or the Plan is amended in any way that directly or indirectly affects the computation of the nonforfeitable percentage of the Participant s accrued benefit or if the Plan is
deemed amended by an automatic change to or from a top-heavy (see Appendix D) vesting schedule, a Participant with at least three (3) Years of Service as of the date the amendment is adopted or as of the amendment s effective date, may
elect to be subject to the pre-amendment vesting schedule. For Participants who do not have at least one (1) Hour of Service in any Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1988, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting
 five (5) Years of Service  for  three (3) Years of Service.  If a Participant fails to make the election described in this Section, then the Participant will be subject to the new vesting schedule. The election of the
pre-amendment vesting schedule shall be made by giving written notice to the Plan Administrator during the election period. The election period shall begin on the date such amendment is adopted and shall end no earlier than the latest of the
following dates:      

(a) 
 The date which is sixty (60) days after the date the Plan amendment is adopted,    
      26  

(b) 
 The date which is sixty (60) days after the date the Plan amendment becomes effective, or        

(c) 
 The date which is sixty (60) days after the date the Participant is issued written notice of the Plan amendment by the Company or Plan Administrator.    
 Such election shall be made only by an individual who is a Participant at the time such election is made and such election shall be
irrevocable. Such Plan amendment shall not reduce the vested percentage of a Participant s accrued benefit as of the later of the date on which such Plan amendment is adopted or the effective date of such Plan amendment.  

6.4  
  Qualified Military Service       If a Participant dies while performing qualified military
service (within the meaning of Section 414(u)(5) of the Code), such Participant shall be credited with years of service for the period of his/her qualified military service.  
      27  

Article VII   Withdrawals       
     
   A Participant is eligible to make regular and/or hardship withdrawals from
the Plan, subject to the provisions of this Article VII. A Participant will continue to be considered a Participant for purposes of eligibility for withdrawals as long as amounts are held in the Participant s Plan accounts, regardless of such
Participant s eligibility to make further contributions to the Plan.      
   Amounts invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund may be withdrawn in
whole shares of the Company s Common Stock, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, or, at the Participant s election, the amount may be withdrawn wholly in cash. Withdrawals from the Default Investment Fund and the Other Investment
Funds will be made only in cash.    The amounts withdrawn by the Participant will be taken from the Participant s accounts in the order
specified in Section 7.4 for regular withdrawals and Section 7.6 for hardship withdrawals and will be subject to any applicable restrictions imposed by the Plan. The Trustee shall sell or purchase securities to meet the Participants 
withdrawal requests but must do so over the period of time necessary to insure that such purchases or sales are made in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations and do not disrupt the trading market for the Common Stock.  
 The value received by a Participant requesting a withdrawal shall be determined in the following manner:  
 If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for a withdrawal  prior to  4:00 p.m. E.T., (i) withdrawals from the Default
Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the day the  
      28  

Appropriate Request is received; provided, however, that if the withdrawal consists of amounts from the CEG Common Stock Fund, withdrawals from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment
Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received, and (ii) withdrawals from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the next
business day after the Appropriate Request is received.    If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for a withdrawal  on or
after  4:00 p.m. E.T., (i) withdrawals from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received; provided,
however, that if the withdrawal consists of amounts from the CEG Common Stock Fund, withdrawals from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the second business day
following receipt of the Appropriate Request, and (ii) withdrawals from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the second business day following receipt of the Appropriate Request.  
 In the case of a hardship withdrawal as described in Section 7.5, an Appropriate Request is not treated as having been made for purposes
of the above valuation procedures until the Plan Administrator approves the withdrawal for payment.      
   For employees with less than 5 years of service, Participant Contributions and
Company Matching Contributions do not mature until 24 months after the date of contributions. For employees with 5 or more years of service, Participant Contributions and Matching Contributions shall mature immediately upon the date of contribution.
All contributions made to a Rollover Account shall mature immediately upon the date of contribution. All Supplemental Contributions made prior to October 1, 2004 are mature.  
      29  

All contributions made to the Employee Stock Account matured prior to October 1, 2004. If a Participant dies while performing qualified military service (within the meaning of
Section 414(u)(5) of the Code), such Participant shall be credited with years of service for the period of his/her qualified military service      

7.2  
  Regular Withdrawals       A Participant may make a regular withdrawal at any time by
submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator. A regular withdrawal is a withdrawal other than a hardship withdrawal and does not include distributions upon termination of employment as described in Article VIII.  
 Each regular withdrawal request received by the Plan Administrator will be paid out as soon as practicable after the request is received.  

7.3  
  Restrictions on Regular Withdrawals         

7.3(a)  
  Regular Withdrawal of Contributions Under the Before-Tax Option       Before-Tax Option
contributions, whether Basic or Supplemental, and related earnings may not be paid out of the Plan as part of a regular withdrawal unless the Participant is at least age 59-1/2, has retired, has been placed on long-term disability, or has terminated
employment for any other reason. A Participant on a leave of absence is not considered to have terminated employment. The source of the amounts withdrawn from the Plan by a Participant who is at least age 59-1/2 or who has retired, been placed on
long-term disability, or terminated employment for any other reason, must conform to the order of withdrawal specified in Section 7.4.  
      30  

7.3(b)  
  Consequences of Withdrawals of Unmatured Participant Contributions       If, in following the
order of withdrawal specified in Section 7.4, any unmatured Participant Contributions are withdrawn, the Participant will be suspended from making contributions to the Plan under the After-Tax Option and the Before-Tax Option for (i) six
(6) months following the month in which the Appropriate Request for the regular withdrawal is received by the Plan Administrator, if such withdrawal is made after September 30, 2004, and (ii) twelve (12) months following the
month in which the Appropriate Request for the regular withdrawal is received by the Plan Administrator, if such withdrawal is made before October 1, 2004. There are no other penalties or restrictions under the Plan for withdrawing amounts that
are eligible for withdrawal.      

7.3(c)  
  Withdrawals of Certain Other Unmatured Contributions       Withdrawals of unmatured
contributions and related earnings from a Participant s Company Matching Contribution Account are not permitted under the Plan. The restriction on withdrawal lapses once these contributions mature.  

7.4  
  Source of Regular Withdrawals       A Participant s regular withdrawals from the Plan
will be taken from the Participant s accounts in the order listed below. For each level in the order of withdrawal, the entire account balance must be exhausted before amounts may be withdrawn from the next level. The meaning of matured and
unmatured accounts as used below relates to the status of the contributions as explained in Section 7.1(c). Unless specifically indicated otherwise, an account includes both contributions and earnings thereon.  

First  
      
 After-Tax Option Account with respect to Participant Contributions made prior to January 1, 1987, followed by earnings thereon.  

Second  
      
 Matured After-Tax Option Account with respect to Participant Contributions made after December 31, 1986, followed by earnings thereon.  

Third  
      
 Rollover Account.  
 
      31  

Fourth  
      
 Employee Stock Account. Withdrawals from the Employee Stock Account will be made first from the portion of the account representing the Participant s investment in the account (i.e., amounts transferred from the terminated
Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan that consist of after-tax contributions made by employees to such plan), and then from the remainder of the account.  

Fifth  
      
 Matured Company Matching Contribution Account.  

Sixth  
      
 Matured Before-Tax Option Account, but only if the Participant has reached age 59-1/2, retired, been placed on long-term disability or terminated employment for any other reason.  

Seventh  
      
 Unmatured After-Tax Option Account with respect to Participant Contributions, followed by earnings thereon.  

Eighth  
      
 Unmatured Before-Tax Option Account with respect to Participant Contributions, but only if the Participant has reached age 59-1/2, retired, been placed on long-term disability or terminated employment for any other
reason.  
   The Participant will be permitted to make a regular withdrawal only to the extent funds eligible for
withdrawal are available in the Participant s Plan accounts.    Withdrawals will be made pro rata in proportion to the
Participant s respective investment in each Investment Fund under the account applicable to the level of withdrawal.      

7.5  
  Hardship Withdrawals         
   A Participant will be eligible to receive a withdrawal under the hardship
withdrawal provisions of the Plan if the Participant submits an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator and receives the Plan Administrator s express sanction and approval for the withdrawal. To obtain approval, the Participant will be
required to demonstrate that the hardship withdrawal is necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need.  
      32  

Because a Participant must withdraw all amounts available under the regular withdrawal provisions
of the Plan and obtain any available loans under the Plan s loan provisions, prior to withdrawing amounts under the hardship withdrawal provisions, hardship withdrawals are limited to the Participant s contributions under the Before-Tax
Option and earnings thereon which are not otherwise available as regular withdrawals or loans. However, earnings on Before-Tax Option contributions are available for hardship withdrawal only if allocated to the Participant s account as of
December 31, 1988.    Following receipt of a hardship withdrawal, the Participant will be suspended from making contributions to the
Plan under the After-Tax Option and the Before-Tax Option and to certain other plans of the Employer, as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(iv)(F), for six (6) full months beginning with the first Payroll Period in the
month following the month in which the hardship withdrawal is approved for payment by the Plan Administrator. A hardship withdrawal will be paid out as soon as practicable after Plan Administrator approval.  

7.5(b)  
  Immediate and Heavy Financial Need       In order to receive a hardship withdrawal, the
Participant must demonstrate an immediate and heavy financial need. The following financial needs will automatically qualify as immediate and heavy.      

1) 
 Medical expenses described in Code Section 213(d) which have been previously incurred or are necessary to obtain medical care by the Participant, the Participant s Spouse, or any dependents of the Participant
as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof.    
      33  

2) 
 The purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Participant.        

3) 
 The payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next twelve (12) months of post-secondary education for the Participant, the Participant s Spouse, or dependents as defined in Code section 152,
without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof.        

4) 
 Mortgage payments or rental payments that must be paid to prevent foreclosure on the mortgage of the Participant s principal residence or eviction of the Participant from his principal residence.    

5) 
 Certain other specified events that are deemed to be of an immediate and heavy financial need as determined by the Internal Revenue Service and published in revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general
applicability.      Other financial needs may qualify as immediate and heavy, based on all relevant facts and circumstances and
subject to the approval of the Plan Administrator. Generally, for example, the need to pay funeral expenses for a family member may qualify as an immediate and heavy financial need.  
 The amount of an immediate and heavy financial need may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or
penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the hardship withdrawal.    It is the intent of the Plan that the definition of an
 immediate and heavy financial need  will conform to the meaning of the term under the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3).  
      34  

7.5(c)  
  Withdrawal Deemed Necessary to Satisfy an Immediate and Heavy Financial Need   Requirements     
 After a Participant demonstrates that an immediate and heavy financial need exists, the Participant must also demonstrate that a hardship
withdrawal from the Plan is necessary to satisfy that need.    Hardship withdrawals under the Plan will automatically be deemed necessary to
satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need if all of the following requirements are met.      

1) 
 The withdrawal does not exceed the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant.        

2) 
 The Participant has elected to receive all dividend distributions currently available under the Plan pursuant to Section 8.5(a), and has obtained all withdrawals, other than hardship withdrawals, and all nontaxable
loans currently available under the Plan.        

3) 
 The Participant s contributions under the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options of the Plan and contributions to certain other plans of the Employer, as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(iv)(F), are suspended for six (6) months following the month of receipt of the hardship withdrawal.    
 Notwithstanding the above, the Plan Administrator may, at his discretion, determine that a hardship withdrawal is necessary to satisfy an
immediate and heavy financial need after a review of all relevant facts and circumstances.    It is the intent of the Plan that the
withdrawals deemed necessary to satisfy the immediate and heavy financial need under this Section 7.5(c), will conform to the withdrawals deemed to satisfy this need under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3).  
      35  

7.6  
  Source of Hardship Withdrawals       A Participant s hardship withdrawals from the Plan
will be taken from the Participant s Before-Tax Option Account, but only after all available amounts have been withdrawn under the regular withdrawal provisions of the Plan and all available nontaxable loans have been taken under the loan
provisions of the Plan. For purposes of this Section, the Before-Tax Option Account includes contributions and earnings allocated thereon as of December 31, 1988. Earnings allocated to the Before-Tax Option Account after December 31, 1988
are not available for hardship withdrawal and, accordingly, are excluded therefrom.    Qualified Nonelective Contributions and earnings
thereon are not available for hardship withdrawal and, accordingly, are excluded therefrom.    The Participant will be permitted to make a
hardship withdrawal only to the extent funds eligible for withdrawal are available in the Participant s Before-Tax Option Account.  
 Hardship withdrawals will be made pro rata in proportion to the Participant s respective investment in each Investment Fund under the
Before-Tax Option Account.    Unmatured amounts not available for regular withdrawal under Section 7.3(c) will also not be available to
the Participant for any hardship withdrawal.      

7.7  
  Direct Rollover of Withdrawals       Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee s election under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of a withdrawal from the Plan that is an Eligible
Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover.  
      36  

7.8  
   In-Service Distributions for Active Duty Members of the Uniformed Services.             
 An individual who is on active duty for more than 30 days in accordance with Section 414(u)(12)(B) of the Code is treated as having been
severed from employment during such period and may elect a distribution in accordance with and subject to the limitations of Section 414(u)(12)(B) of the Code. If a Participant elects a 30-day deemed distribution period, the Participant s
right to make contributions under the After-Tax and Before-Tax Options following such distribution and while on leave must be suspended for a six-month period after the distribution.  
      37  

Article VIII   Distributions   
   
   A Participant will continue to be considered a Participant for purposes of
eligibility for distributions as long as amounts are held in the Participant s Plan accounts, regardless of such Participant s eligibility to make further contributions to the Plan.  
 A Participant is eligible to receive final distributions of all amounts in the Plan when the Participant either reaches age 70-1/2, retires,
is placed on long-term disability, or terminates employment for any other reason. If a Participant dies, the Participant s beneficiary is entitled to any undistributed amounts from the Plan, as provided in Section 8.7. A Participant on a
leave of absence is not considered to have terminated employment and will not be entitled to a distribution from the Plan under the provisions of this Article VIII.      

8.2  
  Required Distributions         
   A Participant s entire Plan balance shall
be distributed, or installment payments shall begin, not later than April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2, unless such Participant is employed by an Employer (in which case such
distribution or installment payments shall commence upon employment termination). However, if there ever is a Participant who is a 5% owner (as defined in Code Section 416(i)), payment must commence no later than April 1 st  of the Plan Year after the Plan Year in which such Participant attains age 70-1/2, even if the Participant is still employed.  
      38  

A Participant who retires,
is placed on long-term disability, or terminates employment for any other reason will automatically receive a final lump-sum distribution of all amounts held in the Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account, Employee
Stock Account, and Rollover Account, if the aggregate value of the accounts is $1,000 or less as of the end of the calendar month in which retirement, placement on long-term disability, or termination for any other reason occurs. The aggregate value
of a Participant s Plan accounts will be determined in accordance with the Trust Agreement and will include the value of any outstanding Plan loans to the Participant. Any distributions from a Participant s accounts that are invested in
the CEG Common Stock Fund will be made in the form of a lump-sum cash payment in lieu of shares of Common Stock, unless the Participant elects a distribution of Common Stock representing investments in the CEG Common Stock Fund by filing an
Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. A distribution under this Section 8.2(b) will be made within 90 days after the end of the month in which retirement, placement on long-term disability, or termination for any other reason occurs.

8.3  
  Distributions Elected by Participant         

8.3(a)  
  Time of Distribution       Participants eligible to receive final distributions from the Plan
and who are not subject to the required distribution provisions of Section 8.2 may elect a distribution by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. Distributions will commence as soon as practicable after the Appropriate
Request is received by the Plan Administrator.    The Participant s final distribution will be made within sixty (60) days after
the later of the end of the Plan Year in which: (i) the Participant attains age 65, (ii) the Participant ceases active employment, or (iii) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the year in which the Participant s participation in
the Plan occurs. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a distribution will not be made unless the Participant submits an Appropriate Request for a distribution with the Plan Administrator. In any case, distributions must begin by the date
prescribed in Section 8.2(a).  
      39  

8.3(b)  
  Method of Distribution       Participants who are not subject to the mandatory distribution
requirements of Section 8.2(b) may elect to receive distributions as lump-sum payments, or as installment payments as provided in Section 8.4(c) made over a period not to exceed ten (10) years. Partial payments may also be made from
time to time as requested under the withdrawal provisions of Article VII.      

8.3(c)  
  Required Minimum Distributions       Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the
contrary, distributions under the Plan shall comply with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) (including the incidental death benefit requirements of Code section 401(a)(9)(G)) and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding anything in the
Plan to the contrary, a Participant or beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Section 401(a)(9)(H) of the Code ( 2009 RMDs ), and who would have satisfied
that requirement by receiving distributions that are (1) equal to the 2009 RMDs or (2) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the
life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Particpant and the beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years ( Extended RMDs ), will receive those distributions for 2009. In addition,
solely for purposes of applying the Direct Rollover provisions of the Plan, 2009 RMDs and Extended RMDs will not be treated as Eligible Rollover distributions.  
      40  

8.4  
  Form and Valuation of Distribution         

8.4(a)  
  CEG Common Stock Fund       Except as provided in Section 8.2(b) under the mandatory
distribution requirement or Section 8.4(c) under the installment payment option, any distributions from a Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Account, Employee Stock Account, or Rollover Account that are invested in the CEG
Common Stock Fund will be made in a lump-sum payment constituting shares of Common Stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.    The
portion of the distribution representing investments in the CEG Common Stock Fund may, at the election of the Participant, be received entirely in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock upon submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan
Administrator.      

8.4(b)  
  Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds       Except as provided in
Section 8.4(c) under the installment payment option, any distributions from a Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account, Employee Stock Account, or Rollover Account that are invested in the Default Investment Fund
and/or the Other Investment Funds will be made in the form of a lump-sum cash payment.      

8.4(c)  
  Installment Payment Option       Participants who are not subject to the mandatory
distribution requirements of Section 8.2(b) and who are retired, have been placed on long-term disability, or terminated employment for any other reason, may elect to receive their distributions in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments
over a period not to exceed ten (10) years. The election to receive such installments must be made prior to receiving a distribution and by means of an Appropriate Request submitted with the Plan Administrator.  
      41  

Participants who have elected the installment payment option and selected an installment payment
period may change the number of years, quarters, or months over which installments will be made at any time after the installment payments have commenced, provided that such change will not result in an installment payment period in excess of ten
(10) years from the date the installments began. The election to change the installment payment period is made by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. Any change in the installment payment period will be effective as
soon as practicable following receipt of the Appropriate Request by the Plan Administrator.    A Participant who has elected the installment
payment option may, at any time, submit an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator to receive a lump-sum payment of the remaining balance in the Participant s accounts.  
 The amounts included in installment payments to a Participant will be taken from the Participant s Plan accounts in the same order
specified in Section 7.4 for regular withdrawals. Unmatured Company Matching Contribution Account amounts remaining in the Participant s accounts after such ordering rules are applied are included in installment payments. The meaning of
unmatured accounts relates to the status of contributions as explained in Section 7.1(c). Unless specifically indicated otherwise, an account includes both contributions and earnings thereon.  
 Amounts invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund may be received under the installment payment option either in whole shares of the
Company s Common Stock with cash in lieu of any fractional share, or, at the Participant s election, in cash. A Participant s election to receive cash or not to receive cash for amounts invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund will apply
to all installment payments made to the Participant subsequent to such election, unless the Participant submits an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator prior to the installment payment date requesting that the Participant s election
be changed.  
      42  

Installment payments that consist of amounts from the Default Investment Fund and the Other
Investment Funds will be made only in cash.    Amounts included in installment payments will be withdrawn from a Participant s
investment funds pro rata in proportion to the Participant s respective investment in each Investment Fund under the account applicable to the level of installment payment.  

8.4(d)  
  Valuation of Distributions       The value received by a Participant requesting a lump-sum
distribution shall be determined in the following manner:    If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for a distribution  prior
to  4:00 p.m. E.T., (i) distributions from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the day the Appropriate Request is received; provided, however, that if the
distribution consists of amounts from the CEG Common Stock Fund, distributions from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the next business day after the Appropriate
Request is received, and (ii) distributions from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received.  
 If the Participant makes an Appropriate Request for a distribution  on or after 4:00  p.m. E.T., (i) distributions from the Default
Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the next business day after the Appropriate Request is received; provided, however, that if the distribution consists of amounts from the CEG
Common Stock Fund, distributions from the Default Investment Fund and Other Investment Funds shall be valued based on  
      43  

Closing Price for such funds on the second business day following receipt of the Appropriate Request, and (ii) distributions from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the
Transaction Price on the second business day following receipt of the Appropriate Request.    For a Participant electing the installment
distribution option, the value received for the first installment payment shall be determined in accordance with the above valuation procedures. For installment payments in subsequent years, the value received shall be determined in accordance with
the above valuation procedures.    The valuation procedures described above shall be applied by substituting the term  Plan
Administrator action  for each place the term  Appropriate Request  appears, in the case of (i) Participants subject to the required distribution provisions of Section 8.2, and (ii) beneficiaries who fail to elect an
earlier distribution as described in Section 8.7(a).      

8.5  
  Employee Stock Account Dividend Distributions       This Section 8.5 applies through,
but is no longer effective after, the Common Stock dividend payment on January 1, 2002.    Any dividends declared and paid on shares of
Common Stock in the Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund held by the Trustee pursuant to the Plan shall be invested by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement in interest bearing accounts. After the final dividend payment in each
year has been made by the Company, the Trustee will distribute to each Participant by not later than December 31st of that year the dividend amounts declared and paid on the shares of Common Stock allocated to the Participant s Employee
Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund. The Trustee shall invest, no less frequently than quarterly, any interest earned on such dividends prior to their distribution, in shares of Common Stock, and allocate such shares to the Participant s
Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund.  
      44  

When a Participant receives final distributions of all amounts in the Plan allocated to his
accounts, any additional dividends which have been declared and paid on shares of Common Stock in the Employee Stock Account and any related interest in the CEG Common Stock Fund which has not yet been distributed under the provisions of this
Section 8.5, will be distributed in cash at the same time as the distribution of the shares of Common Stock in the Participant s Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund.  

8.5(a)  
  CEG Common Stock Fund Employee Election       Effective February 1, 2006, any dividend
paid with respect to shares of the CEG Common Stock Fund allocated to the Participant s accounts as of the record of such dividend will be, as elected by the Participant prior to the payment date (1) distributed in cash to the Participant
as soon as administratively practicable following the date such dividend is paid by the Company or (2) retained by the Trustee and reinvested in Company stock for credit to the Participant s account in the CEG Common Stock Fund. The amount
distributed to the Participant pursuant to clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be the lesser of (A) the original amount of the dividends attributable to that Participant and (B) the amount of such dividends as adjusted for any
investment losses while held in the Trust or reduced for any withholdings. In accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may provide, a Participant shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make an election under this
Section 8.5(a) before the beginning of each quarter of the Company s taxable year with respect to dividends paid in such  
      45  

quarter. A Participant may have only one election in effect for his or her account at any time (and may not make separate elections with respect to the different portions of his or her account).
If a Participant who has previously made a timely election under this Section 8.5(a) does not make a new election with respect to dividends paid in a subsequent period, the Participant s prior election shall remain in effect for such
subsequent period (and shall apply to all dividends paid on Company Stock during such period with respect to which an election is offered). In the absence of a timely election, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have the dividends
with respect to which an election is offered accumulated in his or her account and reinvested in Company Stock.  
      46  

8.6  
  Unlocated Participants       If and when the balance in a Participant s account(s) under
the Plan becomes payable and the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom such amounts are payable, the Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account,
Employee Stock Account, and Rollover Account of the Participant will be closed after three (3) years from the date amounts in the Plan first become payable under Sections 8.2, 8.3, or 8.7. The balances in the closed accounts will be forfeited
and thereafter applied to reduce Company contributions to the Plan. However, if the Participant or his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries subsequently files a proper claim with the Plan Administrator for such amounts, and the claim is filed
prior to the termination of the Plan, the Company will restore the Participant s accounts to the balances that existed when they were closed.  
 Once the amounts have been restored, the balances will be available for distribution in accordance with the distribution provisions of the
Plan.      

8.7  
  Distribution Upon Death of Participant         

8.7(a)  
  Payment to Beneficiary       When a Participant dies, the deceased Participant s
beneficiary is entitled to a distribution of all amounts held in the Participant s accounts.    Unless the Participant s
beneficiary requests an earlier distribution to be made or commenced as soon as possible after an Appropriate Request is submitted to the Plan Administrator, all amounts held in the Participant s accounts will be distributed to the beneficiary
within sixty (60) days after the end of the Plan Year in which the Participant dies.  
      47  

Amounts held in the CEG Common Stock Fund will be paid to the Participant s beneficiary in
Common Stock or in cash in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.4(a). If the beneficiary wishes to receive the distribution in cash, an Appropriate Request must be submitted by the beneficiary to the Plan Administrator. Amounts held in
the Default Investment Fund and the Other Investment Funds will be paid to the Participant s beneficiary in the form of a lump-sum cash payment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.4(b). A beneficiary may not elect to receive the
distribution under the installment payment option.    If a Participant elected a distribution under the installment payment option
provisions of Section 8.4(c) and dies during the installment payment period, or before the installment payment period begins, the remaining balance in the Investment Funds that was to be paid out under the installment payment option will be
paid to the Participant s beneficiary in a lump-sum. Any amounts remaining in the CEG Common Stock Fund will be paid to the beneficiary in Common Stock or in cash in accordance with the Participant s most recent election under
Section 8.4(c). If the beneficiary wishes to receive the distribution in a different form than that which will be received under the Participant s most recent election, an Appropriate Request must be submitted by the beneficiary with the
Plan Administrator. Amounts remaining in the Default Investment Fund and the Other Investment Funds will be paid to the Participant s beneficiary in the form of a lump-sum cash payment.  
 In the event any Participant is deceased at the time of a dividend distribution from the Participant s Employee Stock Account paid under
the dividend distribution provisions of Section 8.5(b), the distribution will be made to the Participant s beneficiary, as determined in accordance with this Section 8.7(a).  
 In the case of a Participant who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)), the survivors of
the Participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.  
      48  

8.7(b)  
  Designation of Beneficiaries       Any interests in the Plan which have not been distributed
to a Participant prior to his death will be distributed to the Participant s surviving Spouse, unless the Participant and his Spouse have jointly designated some other beneficiary or beneficiaries. A joint designation must be made on a special
form provided by the Plan Administrator and duly witnessed by a notary public.    The consent of the Spouse of the Participant will not be
required if it is established to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that the consent of the Spouse may not be obtained because there is no Spouse, because the Spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary
of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe. Any consent of a Spouse (or establishment that the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained) as provided above shall be effective only with respect to such Spouse. For purposes of this
Section 8.7(b), the Spouse or surviving Spouse of the Participant is the Spouse at the time of the Participant s death, except that a former Spouse will be treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse to the extent provided under a qualified
domestic relations order as described in Code Section 414(p). The designation of a beneficiary may be changed at any time by the proper completion and forwarding to the Plan Administrator of the beneficiary-designation form.  
 If a Participant dies and does not leave a surviving Spouse, any undistributed interests will be paid to any beneficiary or beneficiaries that
the Participant has designated on the beneficiary-designation form provided by the Plan Administrator. If a Participant dies and leaves no surviving Spouse and no beneficiary is effectively designated in connection with the benefits due under the
Plan, the benefits provided under the Plan will be distributed to any effectively designated beneficiary (as indicated  
      49  

on the life insurance beneficiary-designation form) of any Company-sponsored life insurance of the Participant. If there is no beneficiary effectively designated to take the proceeds of such life
insurance, the benefits due under the Plan shall be distributed to the personal representative, if any, of the deceased Participant. In any case where the exact intention of a Participant is in doubt in connection with the designation of a
beneficiary, the Plan Administrator shall have full authority to determine such probable intention. The effectiveness of the Participant s beneficiary designation and the Plan Administrator s determination of the intention of the
Participant shall be final and binding upon all parties.    The Plan Administrator may require such proper proof of death and such evidence
of the right of any person to receive payment of the value of the account of a deceased Participant as the Plan Administrator may deem desirable. The Plan Administrator s determination of death and of the right of any person to receive payment
shall be conclusive.      

8.8  
  Direct Rollover of Distributions       Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee s election under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of a distribution from the Plan that is an Eligible
Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover, including, for distributions made after December 31, 2009, an individual retirement plan described in Code Section 408(a)
or (b) for non-spouse beneficiary Distributees as described in Code Section 402(c)(11). Effective for distributions made after October 30, 2009 and subject to the provisions of Section 3.3 of the Plan, an Eligible Rollover
Distribution that includes amounts that are not includable in gross income may be transferred pursuant to this Section 8.8 if the qualified trust or annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the
 
      50  

Code receiving such Direct Rollover separately accounts for the portions of the distribution that are and are not includable in gross income. Effective for calendar years beginning on or after
December 31, 2008, solely for purposes of applying the direct rollover provisions of the Plan, 2009 required minimum distributions pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(9)(H) and extended 2009 required minimum distributions will be treated as
Eligible Rollover Distributions in 2009.      

8.9  
  Qualified Reservist Distributions          The Plan permits a Participant to elect a
Qualified Reservist Distribution. For purposes of this Section 8.9, a Qualified Reservist Distribution is any distribution to an individual who is ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001, if: (i) the distribution is
from amounts attributable to elective deferrals including After-Tax and Before-Tax Options; (ii) the individual was (by reason of being a member of a reserve component, as defined in Section 101 of Title 37, United States Code) ordered or
called to active duty for a period in excess of 179 days or for an indefinite period; and (iii) the Plan makes the distribution during the period beginning on the date of such order or call, and ending at the close of the active duty period. A
Participant that meets the requirements for a Qualified Reservist Distribution under this Section 8.9 will be treated as taking a distribution under this Section 8.9 regardless of whether such Participant is also entitled to distribution
under Section 7.8.  
      51  

Article IX   Loans to Participants   
   
   A Participant will continue to be considered a Participant for purposes of this
Article IX as long as the Participant continues to be a Party in Interest.    At the direction of the Plan Administrator, the Trustee may
make loans to Participants from the Plan. Plan loans will in all cases meet the following requirements.      

a) 
 Loans will be available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis.        

b) 
 Loans will not be made available to Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Participants.    

c) 
 Loans will be made in accordance with all other specific provisions regarding Participant Loans under the Plan.        

d) 
 Loans will bear a reasonable rate of interest as provided under Section 9.3.        

e) 
 Loans will be adequately secured as provided under Section 9.4.        
   A Participant may apply for a loan from his account balance in the Plan subject
to the limitations and other provisions of this Article IX or as may be adopted by the Plan Administrator. Application for loans is made by submitting an Appropriate Request with the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator s action in
approving or disapproving any application for a loan shall be final. The Plan Administrator, in his sole discretion, may direct the Trustee to lend a Participant an amount which does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Participant s
Total Account Balance; provided, however, that the minimum loan amount shall be $1,000 and the maximum loan amount shall be $50,000.  
      52  

For purposes of determining whether a loan exceeds $50,000, such loan shall be added to the
highest outstanding balance of all other loans from the Plan or any other plans of the Employer during the twelve-month period preceding the date on which the loan is made (i.e., the date of the check). Participants making application for a loan
from the Plan may be required to demonstrate their creditworthiness to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator.    A Participant may have
no more than two loans outstanding at a time. A Participant who has an existing loan and qualifies for a hardship withdrawal may be required to obtain a second loan pursuant to Section 7.5(c).  
 Loan proceeds may not be used for the purpose of investing in stocks, securities, or other similar or intangible investments. All loans shall
be subject to the approval of the Plan Administrator, or his designee, who shall review each application for a loan. The Plan Administrator shall adopt such rules, procedures and documents as he may deem advisable in regard to the granting of loans,
provided such rules, procedures, and documents are consistent with the provisions of this Article IX.      

9.3  
  Reasonable Rate of Interest       Each loan will bear a reasonable rate of interest on the
unpaid balance during the term of the loan which (except as provided in Section 9.14) will be equal to the prime rate plus one percent (1%), as reported in the Eastern Edition of the  Wall Street Journal  on the last day of the month
preceding the month in which the Participant submits an Appropriate Request for a loan with the Plan Administrator. The interest rate on a loan will remain in effect for the term of the loan.  
      53  

The Participant shall grant to the Trustee a security interest in the
loan account to the extent of his outstanding principal loan balance. The security interest will secure repayment of the loan and will remain in effect until the loan, together with accrued interest, is paid in full. The amounts in a
Participant s loan account used to secure the loan balance are not available for withdrawal or distribution.      
   Each loan shall be treated as a separate investment of the portion of
the Participant s Plan account balance borrowed and the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee to reduce the Participant s Plan account balance by an amount equal to the amount borrowed. A loan account will be established for the
Participant reflecting the amount of his loan. The money borrowed will be taken from the Participant s Plan accounts in the order shown below. The meaning of matured and unmatured accounts as used below relates to the status of contributions as
explained in Section 7.1(c). Unless specifically indicated otherwise, an account includes both contributions and earnings thereon. Loan amounts will be taken from a Participant s Investment Funds on a pro rata basis.  

First  
      
 Before-Tax Option Account.  

Second  
      
 Unmatured After-Tax Option Account.  

Third  
      
 Company Matching Contributions Account.  

Fourth  
      
 Employee Stock Account,  except  the Participant s investment in the account.  

Fifth  
      
 Employee Stock Account representing the Participant s investment in the account.  

Sixth  
      
 Rollover Account.  

Seventh  
      
 Matured After-Tax Option Account.  
 
      54  

The value received by a Participant requesting a loan shall be
determined in accordance with this Section. Loans will be processed as soon as practicable after the Participant s properly executed loan agreement is received by the Plan Administrator. Loans from the Default Investment Fund and Other
Investment Funds shall be valued based on the Closing Price for such funds on the day the loan is processed. Loans from the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be valued based on the Transaction Price on the day the loan is processed.  
   
   For Participants who are active Employees, payments of principal and
interest on the loan must be made by payroll deduction, whichever is applicable. Participants who are not active Employees are required to make regular monthly payments of principal and interest on the loan by personal check or money order payable
to the Company or its designee, as directed by the Plan Administrator. Each loan shall by its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized in level payments over a loan term that is arrived at by mutual agreement between the
Plan Administrator and the Participant. In no event (other than as provided under Section 9.14), however, will the term of the loan exceed five (5) years unless the loan is to be used to acquire a Participant s principal residence, in
which case, the term of the loan may not exceed thirty (30) years.    A Participant may repay the entire outstanding balance of a loan,
plus any accrued interest, at any time by personal check or money order made payable to the Plan or the Trustee. Loan repayments constituting a repayment of principal will be allocated to the Participant s Plan accounts in the reverse order
from which borrowed. Within the accounts, principal repayments will be allocated among the various Investment Funds in accordance with the Participant s most recent investment directions. The interest portion
 
      55  

of the loan repayment will be allocated to the Participant s Plan accounts on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts originally withdrawn from the Participant s accounts in
order to fund the loan. Within such accounts, interest payments will be allocated among the various Investment Funds in accordance with the Participant s most recent investment directions.  
   
   A default occurs if a Participant fails to make a loan payment within 90 days
after its due date or a beneficiary fails to continue the loan repayments or to repay the loan in full within 90 days after the payment s due date. Upon the occurrence of a default, the Participant or beneficiary, as the case may be, will be
subject to any legal remedies available for collecting the debt. In addition, the outstanding principal amount of the loan may be treated as a distribution, reportable to the Internal Revenue Service. If a Participant defaults on a loan while an
active Employee, the Participant will be suspended from making contributions to, and taking loans from, the Plan for two (2) years from the date of default. If a Participant who is not an active Employee defaults on a loan, the Participant will
be unable to take loans from the Plan for two (2) years from the date of default. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to allow additional time for repayment, subject to the requirements of Code Section 72(p) and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.      

9.9  
  Death of a Participant       If a Participant dies prior to repaying a loan, the outstanding
loan principal will be treated, and reported to the Internal Revenue Service, as a distribution to the beneficiary unless the beneficiary elects either to continue to make monthly loan repayments until the Plan balance is distributed to the
beneficiary under the provisions of Section 8.7(a), or to repay the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest, within 90 days after the last loan repayment was made.  
      56  

A Participant s loan will be evidenced by a loan
agreement, which will include a promissory note and security agreement and payroll deduction authorization, if applicable. Participants will be required to execute a document, or otherwise evidence their agreement electronically (in such form and
manner as the Plan Administrator shall specify), specifying the terms of the loan. Amendments to the loan terms must be authorized by both parties; provided, however, that amendments required as a result of a change to any applicable law or
regulation or the issuance of any new ruling or interpretation by any governmental agency may be made unilaterally to the Plan and the loan agreement upon written notice to the Participant. The loan is at all times subject to such other conditions
as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency.      
   A Participant cannot assign his loan or obligation to repay his
loan to any other person, corporation, or entity. Any attempted assignment of a Plan loan or obligation to repay will be void.      
   No loan shall be made unless such loan is exempt from the tax
imposed on prohibited transactions by Code Section 4975.      
   A Participant who applies for a loan will be charged a loan
initiation fee, as determined from time to time by the Plan Administrator, which will be deducted from the Participant s Plan account balance in the same manner set forth in Section 9.5.  
      57  

9.14(a)  
  Non-Military Leaves of Absence       Participants who are on an approved leave of absence
other than a Military Leave of Absence must continue to make loan repayments during such leave. Interest continues to accrue during such leave of absence at the original interest rate.  
   
   Participants may elect to discontinue making loan repayments
during a Military Leave of Absence, in which case the loan termination date shall be extended for a period equal to the length of the Military Leave of Absence (not to exceed the number of months of missed repayments). In addition, the loan interest
rate for any Participant who is on a Military Leave of Absence and who does not elect otherwise shall, while the Participant is on such Military Leave of Absence, be the lesser of 6% per annum or the original interest rate.  
      58  

Article X   Plan Administration   
   
   The Plan will be administered by the Director   Benefits of the
Company (or the position succeeding to that function) as a fiduciary and as Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall discharge his duties for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their beneficiaries. The Plan Administrator shall be
authorized to delegate his duties and responsibilities hereunder.      
   The Plan Administrator may adopt such rules and regulations as he
may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan on a consistent and non-discriminatory basis.      

10.3  
  Powers and Duties of the Plan Administrator       The Plan Administrator shall administer the
Plan in accordance with its provisions and shall have all powers necessary for that purpose, including, but not limited to, the power (i) to interpret the Plan, (ii) to resolve all questions concerning eligibility for benefits or loans
under the Plan and to require any person to furnish such information as he may reasonably request as a condition to receiving any benefit or loan under the Plan, (iii) to compute or cause to be computed the amount of benefits payable or loans
available here under to Participants or their beneficiaries, and (iv) to direct the Trustee concerning all payments that shall be made out of the Investment Funds pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may, in writing,
delegate any part of his responsibilities and duties (including but not limited to the approval of loans to Participants) to one or more designees and may withdraw such authority by a subsequent writing.  
      59  

The Plan Administrator shall cause to be furnished to each
Participant, on at least a semiannual basis and upon any withdrawal, distribution, or loan to him, a detailed report, indicating the current value of the Participant s interest in the Plan, as well as any other reports now or hereafter required
by law to be furnished to each Participant or any regulatory agency.      
     
   If after a Participant makes a claim for benefits by submitting an
Appropriate Request, such claim is denied in full or in part, the Plan Administrator shall, within ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim, provide the Participant (at the Participant s last address appearing on the records of the
Plan) with written notice by mail, in language calculated to be understood by the Participant, of the denial of the claim stating (i) the specific reasons for the denial, (ii) the specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which
the denial is based, (iii) any additional material or information necessary for the Participant to resubmit the claim, including an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and (iv) an explanation of the claims appeal
procedure, including a statement of the Participant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. If special circumstances require an extension of time to process the
claim, within 90 days after receipt of the claim, the Plan Administrator shall provide the Participant with written notice by mail specifying the reasons for the need for an extension of time, and a date by which he expects to render a decision. In
that event, the initial 90-day period for notice of denial shall be extended by an additional 90 days.  
      60  

If a Participant s claim has been denied or if the Participant has
not received written notice of denial within the period prescribed by Section 10.5(a), he may file an appeal with the Administrative Committee. The Participant or his duly authorized representative may request to review pertinent documents. The
appeal must be submitted in writing within sixty (60) days of the date the Participant receives notice of the denial. The appeal may be made by the Participant or his duly authorized representative. The appeal must state the reasons for the
appeal and shall be accompanied by any evidence or documentation to support the Participant s position. The Administrative Committee shall review the Participant s appeal promptly and shall advise the Participant of his decision in
writing, in language calculated to be understood by the Participant, stating (i) the specific reasons for his decision with specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based, (ii) that the Participant is
entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim, and (iii) that the Participant has a right to bring an action under
Section 502(a) of ERISA.    This written decision shall be sent to the Participant (at his last address appearing on the records of the
Plan) by mail no later than 60 days after receipt of the written appeal, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the appeal, obtaining more information or conducting an investigation of facts. In no event shall the
written decision be sent to the Participant later than 120 days after receipt by the Administrative Committee of the written appeal. The determination of the Administrative Committee shall be final and binding on all parties and not subject to
further appeal.  
      61  

The procedure for review of claims outlined in this Section 10.5
is the exclusive method available for resolving claims under the Plan, notwithstanding the existence of other Employer procedures applicable to Employee grievances in other areas. No Participant or beneficiary is entitled to bring any action,
whether at law or in equity, against any Employer or the Trustee or any of their respective agents, officers or employees, including the Plan Administrator, his designees, or the Chief Human Resources Officer in connection with any right, privilege,
or benefit provided under this Plan unless and until, as a condition precedent, all of the remedies provided under this Section 10.5 have been exhausted.      
   The Company may, in its sole discretion, determine from time to time
which expenses incident to the operation and maintenance of the Plan, and the fees and expenses of the Trustee will be paid by either the Company or the Plan Participants. Any fees and expenses not paid by the Company shall be paid by Plan
Participants.    All brokerage fees and commissions, stock transfer taxes, and other charges incurred by the Trustee in connection with the
purchase and sale of shares of Common Stock for the CEG Common Stock Fund shall be borne by the CEG Common Stock Fund. All expenses and other charges incurred by the Other Investment Funds shall be borne by the respective fund.  
 Administrative fees charged by the institutions which issue contracts for the Default Investment Fund shall be borne by the Default Investment
Fund and shall be reflected in the interest rate for such Fund.    Loan initiation fees will be paid by Plan Participants as set forth in
Section 9.13.  
      62  

The Plan Administrator shall not receive any compensation for his services as Plan Administrator.
     
   The Plan Administrator is the named fiduciary under the Plan
within the meaning of Section 402(a) of ERISA, and shall control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan.    The Plan
Administrator (and his delegatees), the Investment Committee, the Administrative Committee, the Trustee, and any other person who is deemed to be a fiduciary under the Plan, shall not be liable for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another
fiduciary under the Plan except to the extent it or he (a) shall have participated knowingly in, or shall have knowingly undertaken to conceal, an act or omission of such fiduciary, knowing such act or omission was a breach of the
fiduciary s fiduciary responsibilities, (b) shall have, through a breach of its or his fiduciary responsibilities, enabled such fiduciary to commit a breach of its or his fiduciary responsibilities, or (c) shall have knowledge of a
breach of fiduciary responsibilities by such fiduciary, unless it or he has made reasonable efforts to remedy the breach.    This Plan is an
ERISA Section 404(c) plan, as described in Section 404(c) of ERISA and defined by Section 2550.404(c)-1 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under ERISA Section 404(c), Plan Participants and beneficiaries are generally
deemed to be responsible for the results of their investment decisions, and fiduciaries of the Plan may be relieved of liability for any loss, or with respect to any breach of part 4 of Title I of ERISA, that is the direct and necessary result of
the exercise of control by Plan Participants and beneficiaries over assets in their Plan accounts.  
      63  

The Plan Administrator (and his delegatees), members of the Board of
Directors, the Executive Group, and the Investment Committee, the Administrative Committee, and any other officer or employee of any Employer shall be indemnified by the Company or from proceeds under insurance policies purchased by the Company
against any and all liabilities arising by reason of any act or failure to act made in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, including expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of any claim relating thereto.  
      64  

Article XI   Management of Funds   
   
   The Company shall maintain a Trust Agreement with a Trustee, pursuant to
which a Trust shall be established to hold the assets of the Plan. All cash contributions made by Participants and the Company under the Plan shall be paid over to the Trustee as soon as administratively practicable for the purpose of providing
benefits under the Plan. No part of the corpus of or income from these funds shall be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their beneficiaries.  

11.2  
  Trust Agreement; Powers of Trustee       The Trust Agreement shall be subject to the approval
of the Board of Directors prior to execution of the Trust Agreement by the Company. The Company or the Plan Administrator may from time to time amend the Trust Agreement and shall give written notice of any such amendment to the Trustee. The Trust
Agreement, as amended from time to time, shall contain provisions appropriate to carrying out the purposes of the Plan, including, but not limited to, provisions with respect to (i) the power and authority of the Trustee, (ii) the
investment, reinvestment, control, and disbursement of the Trust assets, (iii) the contract or contracts with one or more financial institutions for the Default Investment Fund, and (iv) the authority of the Company or the Plan
Administrator to amend the Trust Agreement, review the performance of the Trustee, and to terminate the Trust Agreement and settle the account of the Trustee.      

11.3  
  Removal and Resignation of Trustee       The Company shall have the power, without
terminating the Trust Agreement, to remove the Trustee and to designate a successor Trustee upon such removal or in the event the Trustee elects to resign.  
      65  

11.4  
  Accounts and Records Maintained by Trustee       The Trustee or the Plan Administrator shall
keep complete and accurate records of all of the assets of, and transactions involving, the Investment Funds with respect to Participant Contribution Accounts under the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options, the Company Matching Contribution Accounts,
the Employee Stock Accounts and Rollover Accounts. If the records are maintained by the Trustee, it shall, in a timely manner, prepare and render all reports and accounting required by law or regulation and shall provide the Plan Administrator with
such reports, accountings, and other information as he may reasonably request. All such records shall be available for inspection and copying during the Trustee s normal business hours by the Plan Administrator, who may elect to employ an
independent certified public accounting firm to review the accounts and records maintained by the Trustee as of the close of each Plan Year and report the results of such review to the Plan Administrator. This report shall be made available by the
Plan Administrator to the Board of Directors, along with such other reports and information as the Board of Directors shall, from time to time, request.      
     
   Each Participant shall have the right, and shall be afforded the
opportunity (on the prescribed form) to instruct the Trustee how to vote or whether or not to tender shares of the Company s Common Stock allocated to his Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account, Employee Stock
Account, and Rollover Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund. To the extent possible, fractional shares will be combined and voted by the Trustee to reflect the instructions of the Participants whose Participant Contribution Accounts, Company Matching
Contribution Accounts, Employee Stock Accounts, and Rollover Accounts in the CEG Common Stock Fund have been allocated with such fractional shares. Shares of Common Stock with  
      66  

respect to which no instructions are received shall be tendered by the Trustee, but shall be voted by the Trustee in the same proportions as the Trustee was instructed to vote with respect to the
shares for which it received instructions. At the time of the mailing of any notice of an annual or special meeting of the Company s Common Stockholders, a copy of such notice and all accompanying proxy solicitation material, together with the
prescribed voting instruction form, shall be furnished to each Participant.    In the case of a tender offer, or other right or option with
respect to Common Stock, a Participant who does not issue valid directions to the Trustee to sell, offer to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of such Participant s Common Stock, shall be deemed to have directed the Trustee that shares of
Common Stock allocated to his Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account, Employee Stock Account, and Rollover Account remain invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund. A Participant s instruction to tender shares of
Common Stock invested in the CEG Common Stock Fund shall not constitute an Appropriate Request for a withdrawal or distribution pursuant to Articles VII and VIII, respectively. Any proceeds received as a result of the sale of Common Stock pursuant
to a tender offer shall be credited to the Participant s accounts from which the tendered shares were taken and shall be reinvested in the CEG Common Stock Fund provided Common Stock is available for purchase and continues to be traded on a
national securities exchange. In the event that, subsequent to any tender offer, Common Stock is no longer available and traded on a national securities exchange, Participants may elect to invest the proceeds received from the tendered Common Stock
in one or more of the other available Investment Funds other than the CEG Common Stock Fund, by submitting an Appropriate Request to the Plan Administrator. Until such time that the Appropriate Request is received by the Plan Administrator, the
proceeds received from the tendered Common Stock shall be invested in the Default Investment Fund.  
      67  

Each Participant shall have the right, and shall be afforded the
opportunity (on the prescribed form), to instruct the Trustee how to vote (if applicable) the Other Investment Fund shares held in his Participant Contribution Account, Company Matching Contribution Account, Employee Stock Account, and Rollover
Account. Shares of Other Investment Funds with respect to which no instructions are received shall be voted (if applicable) by the Company. At the time of the mailing of any notice of an annual or special meeting of any Other Investment Fund, a copy
of such notice and all accompanying proxy solicitation material, together with the prescribed voting instruction form, shall be furnished by the Trustee to each Participant holding shares in the Other Investment Fund.  
      68  

Article XII   Amendment, Termination, Mergers, or Consolidations   
   
   The Plan may be amended, from time to time, by the Plan Administrator as
shall be necessary or advisable in the interpretation, administration, or operation thereof or as required by law upon the advice of counsel. Further, the bonuses and incentives includable in Eligible Compensation in Appendix C may be amended by the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Human Resources Officer of the Company, acting together. The Executive Group may make any amendment to the Plan that does not increase annual Plan liabilities by more than $1 million per
amendment; the Company s Chief Executive Officer shall report all such amendments to the Board of Directors no less frequently than annually. The Chief Human Resources Officer may make any amendment to the Plan that does not increase the annual
Plan liabilities materially, or as required by law upon the advice of counsel. In all other cases, the Plan may only be amended by resolution of the Board of Directors, who shall be entitled to delegate such authority. Under no circumstances shall
the Plan be amended to cause any of the assets of the Investment Funds to be used for or be diverted to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of Participants or their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan,
or to cause the elimination or reduction of any Plan benefit as prohibited under the provisions of Code Section 411(d)(6). Furthermore, no amendment may retroactively reduce the rate at which a Participant shall make contributions to such
Investment Funds, or, except as may be required to conform with future governmental regulations, adversely affect the rights of any Participant with respect to contributions made on his behalf prior to the date of such amendment.  
      69  

The Plan may be terminated, in whole or in part, at any time, by resolution
of the Board of Directors. The Trustee will thereafter be directed to liquidate the Investment Funds. Upon any termination of the Plan other than as provided in Section 13.9, all Participant Contribution Accounts, Company Matching Contribution
Accounts, Employee Stock Accounts, Rollover Accounts, and dividends, if any, accumulated under the provisions of Section 8.5(b), shall be deemed to be matured, and distribution of the balances in such accounts shall be promptly made by the
Trustee in accordance with direction from the Plan Administrator. In making such distribution, any and all determinations, divisions, appraisals, apportionments, and allotments so made shall be final and conclusive.  
   
   In the event of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with,
or transfer of any assets or liabilities of the Plan to, any other plan, each Participant shall be entitled to receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation, or transfer (computed as if such other plan had then terminated) which is
equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before such merger, consolidation, or transfer (computed as if the Plan had then terminated).  
      70  

Article XIII   General Provisions   
   
   Benefits under the Plan shall be payable only out of the Investment
Funds. The Company shall have no responsibility or liability (legal or otherwise) to make any payment of benefits under the Plan. No persons shall have any rights under the Plan with respect to such Investment Funds, or against the Plan
Administrator (and his delegatees), the Company, any other Employer, the Board of Directors, the Executive Group, the Investment Committee, the Administrative Committee, or the Trustee, except as specifically provided for under the Plan.  

No benefit or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assignment,
attachment, alienation, or other legal process, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Except as provided in Section 13.2(b), the preceding sentence will also apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable
with respect to a Participant pursuant to a domestic relations order. Except as provided in Section 13.2(c), benefits under the Plan will be made available to and in the name of the person entitled to such benefits under the terms of the Plan,
or to and in the name of such person s authorized representative. Payments to any financial institution to the credit of such person will constitute payments to and in the name of the person entitled to such payments under the terms of the
Plan.    In addition, to the extent permitted by Code Section 401(a)(13), a Participant s benefits may be offset against an amount
that the Participant is ordered or required to pay to this Plan pursuant to a judgment in a criminal action involving this Plan, a civil judgment in connection with a violation or alleged violation of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, or a
settlement agreement between the Secretary of Labor  
      71  

and the Participant in connection with a violation or alleged violation of such Part. Furthermore, this Section 13.2(a) shall not preclude either (i) the enforcement of a Federal tax
levy made pursuant to Code Section 6331, or (ii) the collection by the United Sates on a judgment resulting from an unpaid tax assessment, to the extent permitted under Code Section 401(a)(13) and the regulations thereunder.  

13.2(b)  
  Qualified Domestic Relations Orders       The anti-alienation provisions of
Section 13.2(a) do not apply to qualified domestic relations orders, as the term is defined in Code Section 414(p), ERISA 206(d)(3) and any applicable regulations thereunder. The Plan Administrator has established and will maintain written
procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Further, to the extent provided under a qualified domestic relations order, a former Spouse of a Participant shall
be treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse for all purposes under the Plan.      
   The anti-alienation provisions of Section 13.2(a) do not
apply to the payment of taxes to any governmental agency, to the extent such payment is authorized by the person entitled to such payment under the terms of the Plan, or is otherwise required by a law that is not preempted by the ERISA
anti-alienation provisions.      
   Each Participant who is subject
to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder shall, in effecting any transaction in the Plan, comply with all applicable provisions of such law, rules, and regulations in addition to
the applicable Plan provisions.  
      72  

13.4  
  Put Option Rights Applicable to Common Stock       Effective February 1, 2006, but only
to the extent required under the applicable rules of Code section 4975(e)(7) with regard to an employee stock ownership plan of the type represented by the CEG Common Stock Fund, shares of Company Stock distributed to a Participant or Beneficiary
with respect to the CEG Common Stock Fund (including a distribution that is a withdrawal) that at the time of the distribution, are not readily tradable on an established market within the meaning of Code section 409(h), as determined by the Plan
Administrator, shall be subject to a put option which shall permit the Participant or Beneficiary to sell such stock to the Company at any time during two option periods, at the fair market value of such shares (as of the most recent valuation
date). The first period shall be for at least 60 days beginning on the date of distribution. The second period shall be for at least 60 days beginning on the first valuation date in the calendar year following the year in which the distribution was
made. The Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee to purchase shares tendered to the Company under a put option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the period during which the put option is exercisable shall not include any time when the shares are
determined by the Plan Administrator to be readily tradable, or when a Participant or Beneficiary is unable to exercise the put option because the Company is prohibited from honoring it, as determined by the Company s chief legal officer, by
applicable federal or state laws, including for these purposes any insider trading policy adopted by the Company in furtherance of applicable federal or state laws. Payment for any shares of stock sold under a put option shall be made in a lump sum
or in substantially equal annual installments over a period not exceeding five years, with interest payable at a reasonable  
      73  

rate (as determined by the Plan Administrator). For purposes of this Section, shares of Company Stock that are listed on a national securities exchange registered under Section 6 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or that are quoted on a system sponsored by a national securities association registered under section 15A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall not be treated as ceasing to be readily tradable for these
purposes merely because the Participant or Beneficiary who receives a distribution of such shares (i) is subject to a stock ownership policy of the Company, (ii) would be subject to liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 if the Participant or Beneficiary transferred such shares, or (iii) is subject to volume limitation or manner of sale requirements pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to transfers of such
shares. Except as may be permitted under applicable law or regulations, the rights of a Distributee of Company Stock under this Section 13.4 shall survive the termination of the Plan and any amendment of the Plan. The Plan is not obligated to
acquire securities from a Participant or Beneficiary at an indefinite time that is determined upon the happening of an event, such as the death of the Participant or Beneficiary.  
   
   Neither the Plan Administrator, the Company, the Board of
Directors, the Executive Group, the Investment Committee, the Administrative Committee, any officer or employee of any Employer, the Trustee, nor their delegatees, guarantees the assets of the Trust in any manner against loss or decline in value.
 
      74  

Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract
of employment between any Participating Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to continue in the employment of any Participating Employer or as a limitation of the right of any Participating Employer to discharge any Employee with
or without cause.      
   The Plan and its administration shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Maryland, except to the extent preempted by Federal law.      
   The masculine pronoun, when used herein, refers to both men and
women, and words used in the singular are intended to include the plural, whenever appropriate.      
   Titles of Articles and headings to Sections in the Plan are placed
herein solely for convenience of reference and, in any case of conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles and headings, shall control.      
   This Plan as amended and restated shall become effective,
provisionally, on September 1, 2006, and shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service for its review and approval. The Company may make further amendments to this Plan which it deems necessary or advisable to achieve Internal Revenue
Service approval. Upon such approval, the effectiveness of this Plan as amended and restated shall become final. If such approval is not forthcoming in a form satisfactory to the Company, this Plan as amended and restated shall be treated as null
and void ab initio; and the Plan as previously approved by the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed to have continued in operation in all respects and without change from that day forward.

is classified prospectively or retroactively by any court, governmental agency, or other authority as an employee under any federal, state, or local law, regulation, or rule for any income tax, wage withholding, wage and hour, or other purposes).
Employee shall include a leased employee within the meaning of Code Sections 414(n)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if leased employees are covered by a plan described in Code Section 414(n)(5) and such leased employees do not constitute
more than 20% of the Employer s Nonhighly Compensated Employee work force, the term  leased employee  shall not include such leased employees.  
 An Employee may be a Full-Time Employee or an On-Call Employee. A Full-Time Employee is any Employee employed on an ongoing and regular basis
who has a basic workweek generally consisting of 40 hours, although Employees who work part-time on a regular and ongoing basis with a basic workweek of less than 40 hours are also considered to be Full-Time Employees. On-Call Employees constitute a
reasonable classification of Employees who do not have a basic workweek, but rather work on an irregular,  on call  basis and do not participate in any  time off  or related benefit plans and are compensated only for those hours
actually worked.    25   Employee Stock Account   means an account established for each Participant in the CEG Common Stock
Fund, into which shares of Common Stock purchased or acquired by the Trustee with Corporate Performance Award Program contributions, loan repayments, or with dividends on shares of Common Stock already in
 
      82  

such account are invested. The Employee Stock Account in the CEG Common Stock Fund is also comprised of amounts for an Employee or former Employee who elected to direct the transfer of the entire
balance of his account in the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to this Plan upon termination of the ESOP. An Employee Stock Account is also established for each Participant in the Default Investment Fund and
the Other Investment Funds pursuant to the interfund transfer provisions as set forth in the Plan.    26   Employer   means

and regulations promulgated thereunder.    28   Executive Group   means the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Human Resources Officer (or the positions succeeding to those functions), acting collectively.  
 29   Full-Time Employee     See definition of  Employee.   
 30   Highly Compensated Employee  , for purposes of the operation of the Plan, generally means an Employee who either received
compensation greater than the amount prescribed in Code Section 414(q)(1) in the year preceding the current Plan Year (e.g., $90,000 for 2003 to determine who is a Highly Compensated Employee in 2004). As used in this definition, compensation
means compensation under Code Section 414(q)(4) and the accompanying regulations.  
      83  

As used below in describing a Highly Compensated Employee, the  determination year  is
the Plan Year for which testing is performed, and the  look-back year  is the immediately preceding 12-month period. Highly Compensated Employees may include both active and former Highly Compensated Employees.  
 As provided under Code Section 414(q), an active Highly Compensated Employee includes any Employee who performed services for the
Employer during the determination year and who is described in either paragraphs (a) or (b) below.      

(a) 
 Employees who at any time during the determination year or look-back year were 5-percent owners of the Employer, within the meaning of Code Section 414(q)(2).    

(b) 
 Employees who received compensation during the look-back year from the Employer in excess of $80,000 (as adjusted under Code Section 414(q)(1)).    
 A former Highly Compensated Employee includes any former Employee who separated from service (or was deemed to have separated) prior to the
determination year, performs no service for the Employer during the determination year, and was an active Highly Compensated Employee for either the separation year or any determination year ending on or after the day the Employee reaches age
fifty-five (55).    Unless otherwise specified, the term Highly Compensated Employee as used throughout the Plan shall refer to an active
Highly Compensated Employee.    The determination of who is a Highly Compensated Employee will be made in accordance with Code
Section 414(q) and the regulations thereunder.    31   Hour(s) of Service   means: (1) each hour for which an
Employee is directly or indirectly compensated or is entitled to receive Compensation from the Employer for the performance of duties during the applicable computation period; (2) each hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly
compensated or entitled to receive Compensation from the Employer (irrespective of whether the employment  
      84  

relationship has terminated) for reasons other than performance of duties (such as vacation, holidays, sickness, jury duty, disability, lay-off, military duty, or leave of absence) during the
applicable computation period; (3) each hour otherwise recognized under one or more of the medical or time-off fringe benefit plans maintained by the Employer; and (4) each hour for which back pay is awarded or agreed to by the Employer
without regard to mitigation of damages. The same Hour of Service shall not be credited under (1), (2), or (3), as the case may be, and under (4).  
 Notwithstanding (2) above, no more than 501 Hours of Service are required to be credited to an Employee on account of any single
continuous period during which the Employee performs no duties (whether or not such period occurs in a single computation period). An hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly paid, or is entitled to payment on account of a period during
which no duties are performed is not required to be credited to the Employee if such payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable worker s compensation, or unemployment compensation or
disability insurance laws. An Hour of Service is not required to be credited for a payment which solely reimburses an Employee for medical or medically related expenses incurred by the Employee.  
 For purposes of (2) above, a payment shall be deemed to be made by or due from the Employer regardless of whether such payment is made by
or due from the Employer directly, or indirectly through, among others, a trust fund, or insurer, to which the Employer contributes or pays premiums and regardless of whether contributions made or due to the trust fund, insurer, or other entity are
for the benefit of particular Employees or are on behalf of a group of Employees.  
      85  

An Hour of Service must be counted for the purpose of determining employment commencement date
(or reemployment commencement date). The provisions of Department of Labor Regulations 2530.200b-2(b) and (c) are incorporated herein by reference.

APPENDIX B   
  CODE LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN   
 B-1  Dollar Limitation on Participants  Before-Tax Option Contributions    During any Plan Year, a Participant s
contributions under the Before-Tax Option of the Plan, when combined with his elective deferrals within the meaning of Code Section 402(g)(3) under all other plans of the Employer and any other employer during the Plan Year, may not exceed the
limitation of Code Section 402(g) (e.g., $13,000 in 2004). This dollar limitation will be adjusted annually at the same time and in the same manner as provided under Code Section 402(g)(5). To prevent the limitation from being exceeded in
any Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may prospectively limit the rate of contribution which a Participant may elect to contribute under the Before-Tax Option. Participants whose Before-Tax Option contributions are limited by this Section B-1 are
automatically treated as electing to increase their contributions under the After-Tax Option by an amount equal to the Participant s Before-Tax Option contribution percentage in excess of the limitation.  
 If due to an administrative error a Participant s contributions under the Before-Tax Option exceed the limitation of Code
Section 402(g) as of the close of any Plan Year, the Participant will receive a distribution from the Plan of the amount constituting such excess Before-Tax Option contributions and any income or loss allocable thereto by no later than
April 15th following the close of the Plan Year to which such excess deferrals relate.    If during the Plan Year in which such excess
Before-Tax Option contributions occurred, or prior to March 1st following the close of such Plan Year, a Participant submits a written certification to the Plan Administrator stating that all or a portion of the Participant s contributions
to the Plan under the Before-Tax Option constitute excess  
      90  

deferrals within the meaning of Code Section 402(g), the Participant will receive a distribution of such excess deferrals, which will be designated as such by the Company, and any income or
loss allocable to such excess deferrals by no later than April 15th following the close of the Plan Year to which the excess deferrals relate.  
 To the extent any Company Matching Contributions were allocable to the Participant s account as a result of excess deferrals, such
Company Matching Contributions and any income or loss allocable thereto will be forfeited and thereafter applied to reduce future Company contributions to the Plan.  
 Distributions of excess deferrals required under this Section B-1 shall be made first from Participant s Supplemental Contributions made
under the Before-Tax Option and income or loss allocable thereto and, thereafter, from Participant s Basic Contributions made under the Before-Tax Option, and income or loss allocable thereto.  
 Income or loss allocable to excess deferrals for the Plan Year will be computed using either a reasonable method that meets the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.402(g)-1(e)(5)(ii) or the fractional method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.402(g)-1(e)(5)(iii). For the purposes of clarity, the income or loss allocable to excess deferrals will not be calculated for
the period after the close of the Plan Year in which the excess deferral occurred and prior to the distribution (i.e. the  gap period ).  
 For purposes of computing the Section B-2 limitations under Code Section 415(c), excess deferrals under Code Section 402(g) will be
treated as contributions under the Before-Tax Option, unless a distribution of such excess deferrals and any income or loss allocable thereto is made no later than April 15th following the close of the Plan Year to which such excess deferrals
relate. Excess deferrals under Code Section 402(g) will be treated as contributions under the Before-Tax Option for purposes of computing the Code Section 401(k) limitations as provided in Section B-4.1, but only for contributions on
behalf of Highly Compensated Employees, even if such excess deferrals and any income or loss allocable thereto is distributed by April 15th following the close of the Plan Year to which such excess deferrals relate. Excess deferrals by
Nonhighly Compensated Employees will not be taken into account.  
      91  

It is the intent of the Plan that the limitations set forth above will conform to the limitations
prescribed by Code Section 402(g). As of the date of any adjustment in the limitations prescribed by Code Section 402(g), the provisions of this Section B-1 will be deemed to have been amended to reflect such adjustment.  
 B-2  Limitation on Total Annual Additions   
 B-2.1  Maximum Annual Additions    The total annual additions to a Participant s account under this Plan and any and all other
defined contribution plans of the Employer shall not in any limitation year exceed the lesser of the limitation in effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A) ($49,000 for 2009) as adjusted for cost of living increases pursuant to Code
Section 415(d) or 100% of the Compensation as defined in Section 4.2(b) of the Plan actually paid or made available to the Participant during such limitation year.  Annual addition , for purposes of this Appendix B-2, means the
sum of the following amounts allocated to the Participant s Plan accounts for the limitation year:      

(a) 
 Employer contributions,        

(b) 
 Employee contributions, and        

(c) 
 Forfeitures.      Amounts contributed by the Participant under the rollover provisions of the Plan
are not considered to be annual additions to a Participant s account for purposes of determining the limitations under this Section. Catch-up contributions under Section 3.1(a) of the Plan and repayment of loans to Participants under
Article IX of the Plan are not annual additions to a Participant s account for purposes of determining the limitations under this Section.  
      92  

B-2.2  Elimination of Excess Annual Additions    To the extent necessary to prevent the
limitation of this Section B-2 from being exceeded in any limitation year, the Plan Administrator may prospectively reduce contributions under the Plan during such limitation year. A Participant s prospective Supplemental Contributions under
the After-Tax Option will be reduced first, followed in order by Supplemental Contributions under the Before-Tax Option, Basic Contributions under the After-Tax Option, and Basic Contributions under the Before-Tax Option until such reductions
eliminate any excess annual additions.    B-2.3  Limitation Year    For purposes of applying the limitations of Code
Section 415 to the Plan, the  limitation year  shall be the calendar year.    If the Employer maintains multiple defined
contribution plans that are aggregated with the Plan for purposes of Code Section 415 pursuant to Appendix B-2.4 and that have different limitation years, the rules of Code Section 415(c) will be applied to the limitation year of the Plan,
and are to be applied with respect to each limitation year of each other such plan. For each limitation year of the Plan, the requirements of Code Section 415 are applied to annual additions that are made for that time period with respect to
the Participant under all such aggregated plans.    B-2.4  Aggregated Plans    The sum of the annual additions credited to a
Participant s account in any limitation year for all of the qualified defined contribution plans of the Employer or a predecessor employer (as such term in used in Code Section 415(f) and the regulations thereunder), regardless of whether
a plan is terminated, may not exceed the limitations of Code Section 415(c).  
      93  

B-2.5  Incorporation by Reference    Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Appendix B or Article IV of the Plan to the contrary, the limitations, adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in this Appendix B-2 shall at all times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the regulations thereunder, the
terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. As of the date of any adjustment in the limitations prescribed by Code Section 415(c), the provisions of this Appendix B-2 will be deemed to have been amended to reflect such
adjustment.    B-3  Reserved .  
 B-4  Limitation on Participant Contributions Under the Before-Tax Option (ADP Test)   
 B-4.1  Maximum Annual Contributions    For each Plan Year, annual Participant contributions under the Before-Tax Option shall
satisfy one of the following actual deferral percentage (ADP) tests:      

(1) 
 The actual deferral percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year shall not be more than 125 percent of the actual deferral
percentage for the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year, or        

(2) 
 The excess of the actual deferral percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year over the actual deferral percentage for the group
of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year shall not be more than two (2) percentage points. Additionally, the actual deferral percentage for the group of Highly Compensated
Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year shall not exceed the actual deferral percentage for the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for
the Plan Year, multiplied by two (2).    
      94  

In determining whether the Plan satisfies the limitation under this Section B-4,
all Before-Tax Option contributions and other elective deferrals, that are made to the Plan and any other plans of the Employer that are aggregated with the Plan for purposes of Code Section 401(a)(4) and 410(b) (other than Code
Section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)), are to be treated as made under a single plan. If the Plan and any other plans of the Employer are permissively aggregated for purposes of satisfying this limitation under Section B-4, the aggregated plans must also
satisfy Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) as though they were a single plan.    For the purposes of this Section
 actual deferral percentage  means, with respect to the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option and the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate
under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year, the average of the actual deferral ratios, calculated separately for each Employee who is eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option for the Plan Year in each group.  
 The  actual deferral ratio  for each such Employee is equal to the annual Participant contributions under the
Before-Tax Option and any  Qualified Nonelective Contribution  made on behalf of such Participant divided by the Participant s Compensation. For purposes of this Section, Compensation generally means an Employee s total
Compensation for the Plan Year; however, Compensation does not include amounts related to any portion of the Plan Year in which an Employee was not eligible to  
      95  

participate in the Before-Tax Option of the Plan. The actual deferral ratio of a Highly Compensated Employee is determined by treating all plans of the Employer that are subject to Code
Section 401(k) under which the Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to participate (other than those that may not be permissively aggregated) as a single plan.  
 The actual deferral ratio for each Employee who is eligible to participate under the Before-Tax Option and the actual deferral
percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee group and the Nonhighly Compensated Employee group shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.  
 B-4.2  Elimination of Excess Contributions    To prevent the limitation under this Section B-4 from being exceeded in any Plan Year,
the Plan Administrator may prospectively limit the rate of contribution which a Highly Compensated Employee may elect to contribute under the Before-Tax Option.  
 The Plan Administrator will establish a maximum rate of contribution for Highly Compensated Employees to avoid exceeding the limits of this
Section B-4.    The maximum rate of contribution for Highly Compensated Employees will be determined by first reducing by 1/10 of a percent
the rate of contribution under the Before-Tax Option of the Highly Compensated Employees having the highest actual deferral ratio. The rate of contribution will be reduced until the ADP test is satisfied, or until the actual deferral ratio is
reduced to the point where it equals the ratio of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest actual deferral ratio. This  leveling  process will be repeated until the ADP test is satisfied.  
 Highly Compensated Employee Participants whose Before-Tax Option contributions are prospectively limited by this Section B-4 are automatically
treated as electing to increase their contributions under the After-Tax Option by an amount equal to the Participant s Before-Tax Option contribution percentage in excess of the limitation.  
      96  

If, after the end of the Plan Year, it is determined that the limitation of this Section B-4 has
been exceeded, the Plan Administrator may authorize the Trustee to distribute the excess contributions and the income or loss allocable thereto to the Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar deferral amounts. Excess contributions are
determined by first determining how much the actual deferral ratio of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest actual deferral ratio would have to be reduced to satisfy the ADP test or cause such ratio to equal the actual deferral ratio of
the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest ratio. Second, this process is repeated until the ADP test would be satisfied. The amount of excess contributions is equal to the sum of these hypothetical reductions multiplied by the Highly
Compensated Employee s Compensation. Excess contributions shall be distributed or recharacterized as contributions under the After-Tax Option (each as set forth below), starting with the Highly Compensated Employee with the greatest dollar
amount of contributions under the Before-Tax Option during the Plan Year until the amount of excess contributions has been accounted for. At the discretion of the Plan Administrator, the excess contributions may be distributed on or before
March 15th following the end of the Plan Year for which the limitation of this Section B-4 is exceeded. With respect to the distribution of excess contributions, such distribution may be postponed, but not later than the close of the Plan Year
following the Plan Year to which the contributions are allocable. To the extent any Company Matching Contributions were allocable to the Participant s account as a result of excess contributions, such Company Matching Contributions and income
or loss allocable thereto will be forfeited and thereafter applied to reduce Company contributions to the Plan.  
      97  

Distributions required under this Section B-4.2 shall be made first from Participants 
Supplemental Contributions made under the Before-Tax Option and income or loss allocable thereto and, thereafter, from Participants  Basic Contributions made under the Before-Tax Option, and income or loss allocable thereto.  
 Income or loss allocable to excess contributions for the Plan Year will be computed using either a reasonable method that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) or the fractional method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(iv)(C). Income allocable to excess contributions shall be determined on a date that is no more
than 7 days before such contributions are distributed.    In the event a distribution of excess contributions occurs, the Company will
designate that the distribution is comprised of excess contributions and income or loss allocable thereto.    As an alternative to the
distribution of amounts exceeding the limitation of this Section B-4.2 after the end of the Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may cause the excess contributions to be recharacterized first as  catch-up contributions  in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations of, Section 414(v) of the Code to the extent that the Participant would otherwise be eligible to make such catch-up contributions under Section 3.1(a) of the Plan, and then as contributions under the
After-Tax Option. The option to recharacterize excess contributions is provided at the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator.    The
limitation set forth in this Section B-4 will be determined and the computation of any distribution or recharacterization of contributions required under this Section B-4.2 will be made after adjustments are made to contributions under the
Before-Tax Option as necessary to avoid exceeding the Code Section 402(g) dollar limitations on contributions as provided in Section B-1.  
      98  

It is the intent of the Plan that the limitations set forth in Section B-4.1 and the corrective
measures set forth in Section B-4.2 will conform to the respective provisions of Code Section 401(k) and the accompanying regulations. As of the date of any adjustment in the limitations prescribed by Code Section 401(k), the provisions of
this Section B-4 will be deemed to have been amended to reflect such adjustment.    B-5  Limitation on Participant Contributions Under the
After-Tax Option and Company Matching Contributions (ACP Test)     B-5.1  Maximum Annual Contribution    For each Plan Year,
the actual contribution percentage (ACP) for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through Payroll Deduction for the Plan Year shall not exceed the  greater of :  

(1) 
 125 percent of the actual contribution percentage for the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through Payroll Deduction for the Plan Year;  or     

(2) 
 the lesser of (a) 200 percent of the actual contribution percentage for the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through Payroll Deduction for the Plan Year,  or 
(b) the actual contribution percentage for the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through Payroll Deduction for the Plan Year plus two (2) percentage points.    
 In determining whether the Plan satisfies the limitation under this Section B-5, all employee and matching contributions that are made to the
Plan and any other plans of the Employer that are aggregated with the Plan for purposes of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) (other than Code Section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)), are to be treated as made under a single plan. If the Plan and any other
plans of the Employer are permissively aggregated for purposes of satisfying this limitation under Section B-5, the aggregated plans must also satisfy Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) as though they were a single plan.  
      99  

For purposes of this Section,  actual contribution percentage  for a Plan Year means,
with respect to the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options and the group of Nonhighly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate through the After-Tax and/or
Before-Tax Options for the Plan Year, the average of the actual contribution ratios, calculated separately for each Employee who is eligible to participate through the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options for the Plan Year in each group.  
 The  actual contribution ratio  for each such Employee is equal to the sum of their annual Participant contributions under the
After-Tax Option and the Company Matching Contributions allocated to their accounts, divided by the Participant s Compensation. For purposes of this Section, Compensation generally means an Employee s total Compensation for the Plan Year;
however, Compensation does not include amounts related to any portion of the Plan Year in which an Employee was not eligible to participate under the After-Tax Option of the Plan or to have Company Matching Contributions allocated to his account.
The actual contribution ratio of a Highly Compensated Employee is determined by treating all plans of the Employer that are subject to Code Section 401(m) under which the Highly Compensated Employee is eligible to participate (other than those
that may not be permissively aggregated) as a single plan.    The actual contribution ratio for each Employee who is eligible to participate
through the After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Options and the actual contribution percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee group and the Nonhighly Compensated Employee group shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.  
      100  

To the extent provided by Treasury regulations, the Plan Administrator may elect to apply the
limitation under this Section by including Employee elective deferrals under the Before-Tax Option.    B-5.2  Elimination of Excess
Contributions    To prevent the limitation under this Section B-5 from being exceeded in any Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may prospectively limit the rate of contribution which a Highly Compensated Employee may elect to contribute under
the After-Tax Option and, if necessary, may reduce amounts which would otherwise be contributed for a Highly Compensated Employee as a Company Matching Contribution.  
 The Plan Administrator will establish a maximum rate of contribution for Highly Compensated Employees to avoid exceeding the limits of this
Section B-5.    The maximum rate of contribution for Highly Compensated Employees will be determined by first reducing by 1/10 of a percent
the rate of contribution under the After-Tax Option, and any related Company Matching Contribution, of the Highly Compensated Employees having the highest actual contribution ratio. The rate of contribution will be reduced until the ACP test is
satisfied, or until the actual contribution ratio is reduced to the point where it equals the ratio of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest actual contribution ratio. This  leveling  process will be repeated until the ACP
test is satisfied.    Any After-Tax Option contributions resulting from the recharacterization of Before-Tax Option contributions under the
provisions of Section B-4.2 are included in the computation of the actual contribution percentage and are subject to limitation under this Section B-5. If the After-Tax Option contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest average
contribution ratio have been reduced to zero, and further reduction is necessary to avoid exceeding the limitation, then Company Matching Contributions relating to Before-Tax Option contributions will be reduced also.  
      101  

Highly Compensated Employees whose After-Tax Option contributions are limited by this Section
B-5, may elect to either prospectively increase their contributions under the Before-Tax Option or increase their cash compensation by an amount equal to the percentage of Eligible Compensation in excess of the limitation. If the Participant fails
to make an election regarding such excess, the excess will be paid to the Participant as cash compensation. Any recharacterization elected by the Participant will be permitted only if it does not cause any other limitations described in Appendix B
to be exceeded.    If, after the end of the Plan Year, it is determined that the limitation of this Section B-5 has been exceeded, the Plan
Administrator may authorize the Trustee to distribute the excess aggregate contributions and income or loss allocable thereto to the Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar contribution amounts. Excess contributions are determined by
first determining how much the actual contribution ratio of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest actual contribution ratio would have to be reduced to satisfy the ACP test or cause such ratio to equal the actual contribution ratio of the
Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest ratio. Second, this process is repeated until the ACP test would be satisfied. The amount of excess contributions is equal to the sum of these hypothetical reductions multiplied by the Highly
Compensated Employee s Compensation. Excess contributions shall be distributed as set forth below, starting with the Highly Compensated Employee with the greatest dollar amount of contributions under the After-Tax Option during the Plan Year
until the amount of excess contributions has been accounted for. At the discretion of the Plan Administrator, the excess aggregate contributions may be distributed on or before March 15th following the end of the Plan Year for which the
limitation of this Section B-5 was exceeded. With respect to the distribution of excess aggregate contributions, such distribution may be postponed, but not later than the close of the Plan Year following the Plan Year to which the contributions are
allocable.  
      102  

Distributions required under this Section B-5.2 shall be made first from Participants 
Supplemental Contributions made under the After-Tax Option and income or loss allocable thereto, and, thereafter, from Basic Contributions made under the After-Tax Option and income or loss allocable thereto, and Company Matching Contributions and
income or loss allocable thereto.    Income or loss allocable to excess aggregate contributions for the Plan Year will be computed using
either a reasonable method that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) or the fractional method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(iv)(C). Income allocable to excess aggregate
contributions shall be determined on a date that is no more than 7 days before such contributions are distributed.    In the event a
distribution of excess aggregate contributions occurs, the Company will designate that the distribution is comprised of excess aggregate contributions and income or loss allocable thereto.  
 The limitation of this Section B-5 will be determined and the computation of any distribution of contributions required under this Section
B-5.2 will be made after adjustments are made to contributions under the Before-Tax Option as necessary to avoid exceeding Code Section 402(g) dollar limitations on contributions as provided in Section B-1 or the Code Section 401(k)
limitations on contributions as provided in Section B-4.    It is the intent of the Plan that the limitations set forth in Section B-5.1 and
the corrective measures set forth in Section B-5.2 will conform to the respective provisions of Code Section 40l(m) and the accompanying regulations. As of the date of any adjustment in the limitations prescribed by Code Section 40l(m),
the provisions of this Section B-5 will be deemed to have been amended to reflect such adjustment.  
      103  

B-6  Gap Period Income on Excess Contributions and Excess Aggregate Contributions  
 The Plan Administrator will not calculate and distribute allocable income for the gap period ( i.e. , the period after the close of the Plan Year in which the excess contribution or excess aggregate contribution occurred and prior to the
distribution). For purposes of this Appendix B-6, the term excess contribution is defined as in Code Section 401(k)(8)(B) and excess aggregate contribution is defined as in Code Section 401(m)(6)(B).

 administrator  of the Plan, within the meaning of such term as used in ERISA. In addition, the Plan Administrator shall be the  named fiduciary  of the Plan, within the meaning of such term as used in ERISA, solely with respect

hereunder, the Chief Human Resources Officer shall appoint a successor. Any successor Plan Administrator shall have all the rights, privileges and duties of the predecessor, but shall not be held accountable for the acts of the predecessor. None of

Company s notice of and right to direct any litigation, select any counsel or advisor, and approve any settlement), except to the extent that such effects and consequences result from their own willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification

None of the Plan Administrator, any person employed in
the Exelon Investment Office nor any member of the Corporate Investment Committee may receive any compensation or fee from the Plan for services as the Plan Administrator, the Investment Office or a member of the Corporate Investment Committee;
provided, however that nothing contained herein shall preclude the Plan from reimbursing the Company or any Employer for compensation paid to any such person if such compensation constitutes  direct expenses  for purposes of ERISA. The
Employers shall reimburse the Plan Administrator, the persons employed in the Exelon Investment Office and the members of the Corporate Investment Committee for any reasonable expenditures incurred in the discharge of their duties hereunder.  
   
   The Plan Administrator, the
Investment Office and the Corporate Investment Committee may employ such counsel (who may be counsel for an Employer) and agents and may arrange for such clerical and other services as each may require in carrying out its respective duties under the
Plan.

is entitled to benefits in an amount greater than those which he or she is receiving or has received may file a claim with the Plan Administrator. Such a claim shall be in writing and state the nature of the claim, the facts supporting the claim,
the amount claimed, and the address of the claimant. The Plan Administrator shall review the claim and, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, within 90 days after receipt of the claim, give notice to the claimant, either in
writing by registered or certified mail or in an electronic notification, of the Plan Administrator s decision with respect to the claim. Any electronic notice delivered to the claimant shall comply with the standards imposed by applicable
Regulations. If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension
exceed 90 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the benefit determination. The notice of the decision of the Plan
Administrator with respect to the claim shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if the claim is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit determination
and shall set forth the specific reasons for the adverse determination, the references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect
the claim, an explanation of why such material or information  

is necessary, and a description of the claim review procedure under the Plan and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant s right (subject to the
limitations described in Sections 13.11 and 13.13) to bring a civil action under Section 502 of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. The Plan Administrator shall also advise the claimant that the claimant or the
claimant s duly authorized representative may request a review by the by the Vice President, Health   Benefits (or such other officer designated from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) of the adverse benefit
determination by filing with such officer, within 60 days after receipt of a notification of an adverse benefit determination, a written request for such review. The claimant shall be informed that, within the same 60-day period, he or she
(a) may be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits and (b) may submit to such officer written comments,
documents, records and other information relating to the claim for benefits. If a request is so filed, review of the adverse benefit determination shall be made by such officer within, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, 60
days after receipt of such request, and the claimant shall be given written notice of the officer s final decision. If the reviewing officer determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the
claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 60-day period and in no event shall such an extension exceed 60 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the
officer expects to render the determination on review. The review of the officer shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such
information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The notice of the final decision shall include specific reasons for the determination and references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based
and shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.    14. By deleting paragraph 1 of current Section 10.6 (now renumbered

fees and expenses of the Trustee, the fees of counsel for the Trustee and other administrative expenses shall, to the extent permitted by law, be paid from the Trust Fund to the extent such expenses are not paid by the Participating Employers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may authorize

expense, shall determine the portion of the expense that is to be borne by each Participating Employer.    16. By deleting paragraph 5 of Section 10.6
(now renumbered 10.3) and replacing it in its entirety as follows:    None of the Plan Administrator, any person employed in

Employers shall reimburse the Plan Administrator, the persons employed in the Exelon Investment Office and the members of the Corporate Investment Committee for any reasonable expenditures incurred in the discharge of their duties hereunder.

  Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan       Except for actions to
which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413 of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant

receives a final decision from the Company s Vice President, Health   Benefits (or such other officer designated from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) in response
to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason
to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from recovering overpayments of benefits or other
amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal or equitable action against any party.      
   Any legal action involving the
Plan that is brought by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the federal courts located in the District of Maryland.      
   Any award of legal fees in connection with an action
involving the Plan shall be calculated pursuant to a method that results in the lowest amount of fees being paid, which amount shall be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to
(a) administrative proceedings under the Plan, (b) unsuccessful claims brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or (c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be
no enhancement for the risk of contingency, nonpayment or any other risk nor shall there be applied a contingency multiplier or any other multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the
Administrator, the Investment Office, the Vice President, Health   Benefits, any Plan fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan
