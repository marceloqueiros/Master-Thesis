      PART I          

ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS                  General             Exelon, a utility services holding company, operates through its principal subsidiaries Generation, ComEd and PECO as described below, each of which is treated as a reportable segment by Exelon. See Note
20 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information.            Exelon was incorporated in Pennsylvania in February 1999. Exelon s principal executive offices are located at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, and its telephone number is 312-394-7398.
            Generation    
        Generation s business consists of its owned and contracted
electric generating facilities, its wholesale energy marketing operations and its competitive retail supply operations. Generation has three reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South and West regions.   
        Generation was formed in 2000 as a Pennsylvania limited liability
company. Generation began operations as a result of a corporate restructuring, effective January 1, 2001, in which Exelon separated its generation and other competitive businesses from its regulated energy delivery businesses at ComEd and PECO.
Generation s principal executive offices are located at 300 Exelon Way, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania 19348, and its telephone number is 610-765-5959.         
   ComEd          
  ComEd s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and
distribution services to retail customers in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.            ComEd was organized in the State of Illinois in 1913 as a result of the merger of Cosmopolitan Electric Company into the original corporation named Commonwealth Edison Company, which was incorporated in 1907.
ComEd s principal executive offices are located at 440 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60605, and its telephone number is 312-394-4321.         
   PECO          
  PECO s energy delivery business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and
distribution services to retail customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services to retail customers in the
Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.         
  PECO was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. PECO s principal executive offices are located at 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
19103, and its telephone number is 215-841-4000.         
     Generation          
  Generation is one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States, as measured by owned and controlled MW. Generation
combines its large generation fleet with an   
         1   

Table of Contents  

experienced wholesale energy marketing operation and a competitive retail supply operation. Generation s presence in well-developed wholesale energy markets, integrated hedging strategy that
mitigates the adverse impact of short-term market volatility, and low-cost nuclear generating fleet, which is operated consistently at high capacity factors, position it well to succeed in competitive energy markets.   
        At December 31, 2010, Generation owned generation resources with
an aggregate net capacity of 25,619 MW, including 17,047 MW of nuclear capacity. Generation controlled another 6,139 MW of capacity through long-term contracts.         
  Generation s wholesale marketing unit, Power Team, draws upon Generation s energy generation portfolio and logistical expertise to ensure
delivery of energy to Generation s wholesale customers under long-term and short-term contracts and in spot markets.         
  Generation s retail business provides retail electric and gas services as an unregulated retail energy supplier in Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Ohio. Generation s retail business is dependent upon continued deregulation of retail electric and gas markets and Generation s ability to obtain supplies of electricity and gas at competitive prices in the wholesale market.
           Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act,
which gives the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales
of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. The FERC s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including Generation, which is a
public utility as FERC defines that term) and set cost-based rates should the FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited
to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and
cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities. Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various
other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC, with the approval of the
FERC.            RTOs exist in a number of regions to provide
transmission service across multiple transmission systems. To date, PJM, the MISO, ISO-NE and Southwest Power Pool, have been approved as RTOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger
wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market monitoring and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service
across several transmission systems.

     Generating Resources     
        At December 31, 2010, the generating resources of Generation
consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  See  Fuel  for sources of fuels used in electric generation.     

(b)  
  Includes 933 MW of capacity related to Units 1 and 2 at Cromby Generating Station and Units 1 and 2 at Eddystone Generating Station, which were approved for retirement by the
Exelon Board of Directors on December 1, 2009. See Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.     

(c)  
  Includes Exelon Wind assets acquired on December 9, 2010. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

(d)  
  Long-term contracts range in duration up to 21 years.           
  Generation has three reportable segments, the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South and West, representing the different geographical areas in which
Generation s power marketing activities are conducted and where Generation s owned and contracted generating resources are located. Mid-Atlantic represents Generation s operations primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland
(approximately 36% of capacity); Midwest includes the operations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota (approximately 46% of capacity); and the South and West includes operations primarily in Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Idaho
and Oregon (approximately 18% of capacity).              Nuclear Facilities
             Generation has ownership interests in eleven
nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 19 units with an aggregate of 17,047 MW of capacity. Generation wholly-owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for Quad Cities Generating Station (75% ownership), Peach
Bottom Generating Station (50% ownership) and Salem Generating Station (Salem) (42.59% ownership). Generation s nuclear generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG
Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2010 and 2009, electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 82% and 81%, respectively, of Generation s total electric supply, which
also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of
Generation s electric supply sources.              AmerGen
Reorganization.   AmerGen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation through January 8, 2009, owned and operated the Clinton Nuclear Power Station (Clinton), the Three Mile Island (TMI) Unit No. 1 and the Oyster Creek Generating
Station (Oyster Creek) through that time. Effective January 8, 2009, AmerGen was merged into Generation, which now holds the operating licenses for Clinton, TMI and Oyster Creek.              Oyster Creek Station Shutdown.   On December 8, 2010, in connection with the executed Administrative
Consent Order (ACO) with the NJDEP, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the closure of Oyster Creek.

     Nuclear Operations.   Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and
duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. As the largest generator of nuclear power in the United States, Generation can negotiate favorable terms for the materials and
services that its business requires. Generation s nuclear plants have historically benefited from minimal environmental impact from operations and a safe operating history.   
        During 2010 and 2009, the nuclear generating facilities operated by
Generation achieved capacity factors of 93.9% and 93.6%, respectively. Generation aggressively manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable
generation base for Generation s short and long-term supply commitments and Power Team marketing and trading activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the
occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe reliable operations.            In addition to the rigorous maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe
operation of the nuclear units. Generation has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident.   
          Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation.   Generation is
subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering,
among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and
inspection results, and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2010, the NRC categorized each unit operated by Generation in the Licensee Response Column, which is the highest performance band. The NRC may modify,
suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial
increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities and/or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units.   
         4

     Licenses   .  Generation has 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its
nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3, Dresden Units 2 and 3, Quad Cities Units 1 and 2, Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island Unit 1. The following table summarizes the current operating
license expiration dates for Generation s nuclear facilities in service:         

(a)  
  Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.     

(b)  
  Stations previously owned by ComEd.     

(c)  
  Stations previously owned by AmerGen.     

(d)  
  Stations previously owned by PECO.     

(e)  
  Stations for which the NRC has issued a renewed operating licenses for Dresden Unit 2 and Unit 3.     

(f)  
  On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. See Note 18 of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.              On May 29, 2009, a coalition of citizen groups filed a Petition for Review of the NRC s renewal of Oyster Creek s operating license in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Oral
argument was held before the Court on January 5, 2011. If the appeal is successful, it is unlikely that it would result in a revocation of the renewed license; however, it could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions over the course of
the period of extended operation.           On August 18, 2009,
PSEG submitted an application to the NRC to extend the operating licenses of Salem Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. The NRC is expected to spend a total of 22 to 30 months to review the application before making a decision.   
        Generation expects to apply for and obtain approval of license renewals
for the remaining nuclear units. The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process until completion of the NRC s review. The NRC review process takes approximately two
years from the docketing of an application. Each requested license renewal is expected to be for 20 years beyond the original license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the
actual and assumed renewal of operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations.

     Nuclear Uprate Program.   During 2009, Generation announced a series of planned power
uprates across its nuclear fleet that will result in between 1,300 and 1,500 MW of additional generation capacity within eight years. The uprate projects represent a total investment of approximately $3.65 billion in overnight cost, as measured in
2010 dollars. Using proven technologies, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and learning from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Uprate projects, representing approximately 60% of the
planned uprate MW, are underway at the Limerick and Peach Bottom nuclear stations in Pennsylvania and the Byron, Braidwood, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities plants in Illinois. The remainder will come from additional projects across
Generation s nuclear fleet beginning in 2011 and ending in 2017. At 1,500 nuclear-generated MW, the uprates would displace 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually that would otherwise come from burning fossil fuels. The uprates
are being undertaken pursuant to an organized, strategically sequenced implementation plan. The implementation effort includes a periodic review and refinement of the projects in light of changing market conditions. As part of this periodic review
process, the uprate project at Three Mile Island is currently under evaluation. The amount of expenditures to implement the plan ultimately will depend on economic and policy developments, and will be made on a project-by-project basis in accordance
with Exelon s normal project evaluation standards. The ability to implement several projects requires the successful resolution of various technical issues. The resolution of these issues may affect the timing and amount of the power increases
associated with the power uprate initiative. Through December 31, 2010, Generation has added 101 MWs of nuclear generation through its uprate program, with another 98 MWs scheduled to be added in 2011.   
          New Site Development.   Generation is keeping open the
option of a new nuclear plant located in Victoria County in southeast Texas; however, Generation has not made a decision to build a nuclear plant at this time. In response to the overall downturn of the economy and the projection of sustained, low
natural gas prices, Exelon revised its new nuclear plant development strategy. Exelon had previously submitted a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) application to the NRC for the Victoria site. On March 25, 2010, Exelon submitted
an application for an Early Site Permit (ESP) application for the site and subsequently withdrew its COL application. The ESP allows Exelon to establish the suitability of the Victoria site, which lessens the amount of work to do should it later
decide to reapply for a COL. Additionally, the ESP accommodates a variety of possible future plant designs, allowing for flexibility in selecting a reactor technology later as part of a COL application. If approved by the NRC, the ESP would
effectively reserve the site for 20 years with the possibility of renewal for another 20 years. Any decision to build at the Victoria County site would be made later based on then current economics. The Exelon board authorized a budget of $130
million for the Victoria County project, of which a total of $108 million had been expensed through December 31, 2010. The review and approval schedule published by the NRC estimates final issuance of the ESP in late 2014.   
          Nuclear Waste Disposal.   There are no facilities for the
reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools or in
dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations.   
        As of December 31, 2010, Generation had approximately 54,300 SNF
assemblies (13,100 tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage (this includes SNF at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership, see Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding Zion Station Decommissioning). On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation s sites through the end of the license renewal
periods, and through

Dry cask storage will be in operation at those sites prior to the closing of their on-site storage pools.     

(b)  
  The DOE previously has indicated it will begin accepting spent fuel in 2020. If this does not occur, Three Mile Island will need an onsite dry cask storage facility.
             For a discussion of matters associated with
Generation s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
  As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed
of at Federally licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste
generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020. Pennsylvania, which had agreed to be the host
site for LLRW disposal facilities for generators located in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia, has suspended the search for a permanent disposal site.   
        Generation is currently utilizing on-site storage capacity at its
nuclear generation stations for limited amounts of LLRW and has been shipping its Class A LLRW, which represent 93% of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina. The disposal facility in South Carolina at
present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Oyster Creek and Salem), and Connecticut. Generation has pending license amendments for its Peach Bottom and LaSalle stations that will allow it to
store LLRW from its remaining stations that have limited capacity. If approved, there will enough storage capacity to store all Class B and C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generations nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative
disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize cost impacts and on-site storage.         
    Nuclear Insurance.   Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with a major accidental outage at
any of its nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See  Nuclear Insurance  within Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for details.            For information regarding property
insurance, see ITEM 2. Properties Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a
material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition and results of operations.

     Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities
demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. See ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations Exelon Corporation, Executive Overview; ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning Asset
Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Notes 2, 8 and 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation s NDT funds and its decommissioning
obligations.            Dresden Unit 1 and Peach Bottom Unit 1 have
ceased power generation. SNF at Dresden Unit 1 is currently being stored in dry cask storage until a permanent repository under the NWPA is completed. All SNF for Peach Bottom Unit 1, which ceased operation in 1974, has been removed from the site
and the SNF pool is drained and decontaminated. Generation s estimated liability to decommission Dresden Unit 1 and Peach Bottom Unit 1 was $182 million at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, NDT funds set aside to pay for
these obligations were $330 million.             Zion Station
Decommissioning.  On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC. (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions, under which ZionSolutions
has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998.         
  On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred
to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and
other liabilities associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions can periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However,
ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined in the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are
met. See Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Zion Station Decommissioning.         
    Fossil, Hydroelectric and Renewable Facilities           
  Generation operates various fossil, hydroelectric and renewable facilities and maintains ownership interests in several other facilities including
LaPorte, Keystone, Conemaugh and Wyman, which are operated by third parties. In 2010 and 2009, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generating facilities was 6% of Generation s total electric supply.
The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation s power marketing activities. For additional information regarding Generation s electric generating facilities, see ITEM 2. Properties Generation.   
          John Deere Renewables   .  On December 9,
2010, Generation acquired all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind), a leading operator and developer of wind power, for approximately $893 million in cash. Generation acquired 735 MWs of installed,
operating wind capacity located in eight states. Approximately 75% of the operating portfolio s expected output is already sold under long-term power purchase arrangements. Additionally, Generation will pay up to $40 million related to three
projects with a capacity of 230 MWs which are currently in advanced stages of development, contingent upon meeting certain contractual commitments related to the commencement of construction of each project. This contingent consideration was valued
at $32 million of which approximately $16 million has been recorded as a current liability and the remainder has been recorded as a noncurrent liability. As a result, total   
         8   

Table of Contents  

consideration recorded for the Exelon Wind acquisition was $925 million. See Note 3 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Exelon
Wind acquisition.              Plant Retirements.   On
December 2, 2009, Exelon announced its intention to permanently retire three coal-fired generating units and one oil/gas-fired generating unit, effective May 31, 2011. The units to be retired are Cromby Generating Station (Cromby) Unit 1
and Unit 2 and Eddystone Generating Station (Eddystone) Unit 1 and Unit 2. These actions were in response to the economic outlook related to the continued operation of these four units. Subsequently, PJM determined that transmission reliability
upgrades will be necessary to alleviate reliability impacts and that those upgrades will be completed in a manner that will permit Generation s retirement of the units on the following schedule: Cromby Unit 1 and Eddystone Unit 1 on
May 31, 2011; Cromby Unit 2 on December 31, 2011; and Eddystone Unit 2 on June 1, 2012. These dates are dependent upon the completion of required transmission reliability upgrades and may be subject to further change. Generation
revised the depreciable useful lives for the affected units to reflect the revised deactivation dates. For more information regarding plant retirements, see Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
          Licenses.   Fossil and renewable generation plants are
generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or
connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project expires on August 31, 2014 and for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project expires on September 1, 2014. In March 2009, Generation filed a
Pre-Application Document and Notice of Intent to renew the licenses, pursuant to FERC relicensing requirements. For those plants located within the control areas administered by PJM or the New England control area administered by ISO-NE, notice is
required to be provided to PJM or ISO-NE, as applicable, before a plant can be retired.              Insurance.   Generation does not purchase business interruption insurance for its wholly owned fossil and hydroelectric operations. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For
property damage and liability claims, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon and
Generation s financial condition and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. Properties Generation.   
          Long-Term Contracts     
        In addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation
sells electricity purchased under the following long-term contracts in effect as of December 31, 2010:         
 
         9   

Table of Contents  

(a)  
  Generation has sold its rights to 945 MW of capacity, energy, and ancillary services supplied from its existing long-term contract with Tenaska Georgia Partners, LP through a PPA
with Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company for a 20 year period that began on June 1, 2010.     

(b)  
  Commencing June 1, 2012 and lasting for 10 years, Generation has agreed to sell its rights to 520 MW, or approximately two-thirds, of capacity, energy, and ancillary
services supplied from its existing long-term contract with Green Country Energy, LLC through a PPA with Public Service Company of Oklahoma, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc..     

(c)  
  Includes long-term capacity contracts with seven counterparties.           
    Fuel           
  The following table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for 2010 and estimated for 2011:   

(a)  
  Represents Generation s proportionate share of the output of its generating plants.     
        The fuel costs for nuclear generation are substantially less than for
fossil-fuel generation. Consequently, nuclear generation is generally the most cost-effective way for Generation to meet its wholesale obligations, including to ComEd and PECO, and some of Generation s retail business requirements.   
        The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the
mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has uranium concentrate
inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through 2015. Generation s contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through 2015. All of
Generation s enrichment requirements have been contracted through 2012. Contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through 2013. Generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion,
enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units.            Coal is procured primarily through annual supply contracts, with the remainder supplied through either short-term contracts or spot-market purchases.            Natural gas is procured through annual, monthly and spot-market purchases. Some fossil generation stations can use either
oil or natural gas as fuel. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market
pricing.            Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate
price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Generation also hedges forward price risk with both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.

     Power Team           
  Generation s wholesale marketing and retail electric supplier operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through
its generation capacity and through long-term, intermediate-term and short-term contracts. Generation seeks to maintain a net positive supply of energy and capacity, through ownership of generation assets and power purchase and lease agreements, to
protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its owned or contracted power generating units. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. PPAs are commitments related to power
generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature similar to asset ownership. Generation enters into PPAs as part of its overall strategic plan, with objectives such as obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its
physical delivery obligations to customers and assisting customers to meet renewable portfolio standards. Generation may buy power to meet the energy demand of its customers, including ComEd and PECO. These purchases may be for more than the energy
demanded by Power Team s customers. Power Team then sells this open position, along with capacity not used to meet customer demand, in the wholesale electricity markets. Where necessary, Generation also purchases transmission service to ensure
that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs in markets without an organized RTO. Generation also incorporates contingencies into its planning for extreme weather conditions,
including potentially reserving capacity to meet summer loads at levels representative of warmer-than-normal weather conditions.         
  Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing
activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation also enters into transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan, such as a financial swap with ComEd
that is described below and runs into 2013. However, except for the ComEd swap arrangement, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk beyond 2011 for which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio may be unhedged.
Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in subsequent years. As of December 31, 2010, the percentage of expected generation hedged was 90%-93%, 67%-70%, and 32%-35% for 2011, 2012
and 2013, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or
contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include cash flow hedges, other derivatives and certain non-derivative contracts, including sales to ComEd and PECO to serve their retail load. A portion of
Generation s hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. The trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy
that includes stringent risk management limits including volume, stop-loss and value-at-risk limits to manage exposure to market risk. Additionally, the corporate risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the power
marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation s efforts.   
         11   

Table of Contents  

   At December 31, 2010, Generation s short and long-term commitments relating to the purchase
and sale of energy and capacity from and to unaffiliated utilities and others were as follows:         

(a)  
  Net capacity purchases include PPAs and other capacity contracts that are accounted for as operating leases. Amounts presented as commitments represent Generation s expected
payments under these arrangements at December 31, 2010, including certain capacity charges which are subject to plant availability.     

(b)  
  Excludes renewable energy PPA contracts that are contingent in nature.     

(c)  
  Transmission rights purchases include estimated commitments for additional transmission rights that will be required to fulfill firm sales contracts.     
        ComEd procures all of its electricity through a competitive procurement
process, through which Generation supplies a portion of ComEd s load. Additionally, in order to fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement, Generation and ComEd entered into a five-year financial swap contract that expires on May 31,
2013. See ComEd Retail Electric Services, Procurement Related Proceedings for additional information regarding ComEd s procurement-related proceedings and the financial swap contract.   
        Generation had a PPA with PECO under which Generation supplied PECO
with all of PECO s electric supply needs through December 31, 2010. Generation supplied electricity to PECO from its portfolio of generation assets, PPAs and other market sources. As of January 1, 2011, PECO procures all of its
electricity through a competitive procurement process, through which Generation will continue to supply a portion of PECO s load. See PECO Retail Electric Services, Procurement Related Proceedings for additional information regarding
PECO s competitive, full-requirements energy-supply procurement process after 2010.              Capital Expenditures              Generation s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation and in other internal infrastructure projects. Generation s estimated capital expenditures for 2011 are
as follows:         

(a)  
  Includes Generation s share of the investment in nuclear fuel for the co-owned Salem plant

      ComEd    
        ComEd is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale
of electricity and the provision of distribution and transmission services to a diverse base of residential, commercial and industrial customers in northern Illinois. ComEd is a public utility under the Illinois Public Utilities Act subject to
regulation by the ICC related to distribution rates and service, the issuance of securities, and certain other aspects of ComEd s business. ComEd is a public utility under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to
transmission rates and certain other aspects of ComEd s business. Specific operations of ComEd are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, ComEd is subject to mandatory
reliability standards set by the NERC.            ComEd s retail
service territory has an area of approximately 11,300 square miles and an estimated population of 9 million. The service territory includes the City of Chicago, an area of about 225 square miles with an estimated population of 3 million. ComEd has
approximately 3.8 million customers.            ComEd s
franchises are sufficient to permit it to engage in the business it now conducts. ComEd s franchise rights are generally nonexclusive rights documented in agreements and, in some cases, certificates of public convenience issued by the ICC. With
few exceptions, the franchise rights have stated expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2066. ComEd anticipates working with the appropriate agencies to extend or replace the franchise agreements prior to expiration.   
        ComEd s kWh sales and peak electricity load are generally higher
during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. ComEd s highest peak load occurred on August 1, 2006 and was 23,613 MW; its highest peak load during a winter season
occurred on January 15, 2009 and was 16,328 MW.              Retail Electric
Services              Under Illinois law, transmission and
distribution service is regulated, while electric customers are allowed to purchase generation from a competitive electric generation supplier.         
  At December 31, 2010, approximately 66,200 retail customers (primarily commercial and industrial customers), representing approximately 52% of
ComEd s annual retail kWh sales, had elected to purchase their electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. There are currently a minimal number of residential customers being served by alternate suppliers. Customers who receive
electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier continue to pay a delivery charge to ComEd. Under the current regulatory mechanisms in effect, ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers, without
mark-up. Thus, although energy sales affect ComEd s reported revenues, they do not affect its net income, as the energy sales are offset by equal amount of purchased power expense.            Under Illinois law, ComEd is required to deliver electricity to all customers. ComEd s obligation to provide
generation supply service, which is referred to as a POLR obligation, primarily varies by customer size. ComEd s obligation to provide such service to residential customers and other small customers with demands of under 100 kW continues for
all customers who do not or cannot choose a competitive electric generation supplier or who choose to return to the utility after taking service from a competitive electric generation supplier. ComEd does not have a fixed-price generation supply
service obligation to most of its largest customers with demands of 100 kW or greater, as this group of customers has previously been declared competitive. Beginning June 2010 ComEd had no fixed price generation supply service obligations for
customers with demands of 100-400 kW. Customers with competitive declarations may still purchase power and energy from ComEd, but only at hourly market prices.  
         13   

Table of Contents  

    Procurement Related Proceedings.  ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity procurement
costs from retail customers without mark-up. Beginning on January 1, 2007, ComEd procured 100% of energy to meet its load service requirements through ICC-approved staggered SFCs with various suppliers, including Generation. Beginning in June
2009, under the Illinois Settlement Legislation, the IPA designs, and the ICC approves an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and administers a competitive process under which ComEd procures its electricity supply from various suppliers,
including Generation. In order to fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement, ComEd hedged the price of a significant portion of energy purchased on the spot market with a five-year variable-to-fixed financial swap contract with Generation
that expires on May 31, 2013. See Notes 2 and 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ComEd s procurement-related proceedings and the financial swap contract.   
         Electric Distribution Rate Cases . The ICC issued an order in
ComEd s 2007 electric distribution rate case approving a $274 million increase in ComEd s annual delivery services revenue requirement, which became effective in September 2008. ComEd and several other parties filed appeals of the rate
order with the Illinois Appellate Court (Court). The Court issued a decision on September 30, 2010, ruling against ComEd on the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation and the recovery of costs for an AMI/Customer Applications
pilot program via a rider (Rider SMP). On November 18, 2010, the Court denied ComEd s petition for rehearing in connection with the September 30, 2010 ruling. On January 25, 2011, ComEd filed a Petition for Leave to Appeal to the
Illinois Supreme Court. Subsequent to the Illinois Appellate Court s ruling, ComEd filed a request with the ICC to allow it to request recovery, through inclusion in the 2010 Rate Case, of $3 million in operation and maintenance costs, as well
as carrying costs associated with capital investment in the ICC-approved AMI/Customer Applications pilot program. The AMI pilot program capital investment had already been requested in rate base in the 2010 Rate Case. On December 2, 2010, the
ICC approved ComEd s request. The investment and the pilot program costs are subject to challenge in the 2010 Rate Case proceeding.         
  On June 30, 2010, ComEd requested ICC approval for an increase of $396 million, subsequently changed to $326 million, to its annual delivery
services revenue requirement (2010 Rate Case) to allow ComEd to continue modernizing its electric delivery system and recover the costs of substantial investments made since its last rate filing in 2007. The requested rate increase also reflects
increased costs, most notably pension and OPEB, since ComEd s rates were last determined. The Court s September 30, 2010 ruling in connection with ComEd s 2007 electric distribution rate case makes it highly unlikely that the ICC
would decide the post-test year accumulated depreciation issue in ComEd s favor in the 2010 Rate Case. ComEd estimates that its requested revenue requirement increase of $326 million could be reduced by approximately $85 million as a result of
this adjustment. Certain parties have submitted testimony recommending significant reductions to ComEd s requested increase as well as the write-off of certain assets, most notably the regulatory asset associated with severance costs, which was
approximately $74 million as of December 31, 2010. Management believes the regulatory asset is appropriate based on the ICC s orders in ComEd s last two rate cases. The new electric distribution rates are expected to take effect no
later than June 2011. ComEd cannot predict how much of the requested electric distribution rate increase the ICC may approve. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ComEd s rate case
proceedings.             Other.  Illinois law provides that in
the event an electric utility, such as ComEd, experiences a continuous power interruption of four hours or more that affects (in ComEd s case) 30,000 or more customers, the utility may be liable for actual damages suffered by customers as a
result of the interruption and may be responsible for reimbursement of local governmental emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with the interruption. Recovery of consequential damages is barred. The affected utility may seek
from the ICC a waiver of these liabilities when the   
         14   

Table of Contents  

utility can show that the cause of the interruption was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions, customer tampering, or certain other causes enumerated in the law. ComEd does not
believe that during the years 2010, 2009 and 2008 it had any interruptions that have triggered this damage liability or reimbursement requirement.        
    Construction Budget           
  ComEd s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments primarily in energy transmission and distribution facilities, to
ensure the adequate capacity and reliability of its system. Based on PJM s RTEP, ComEd has various construction commitments, as discussed in Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ComEd s most recent estimate
of capital expenditures for electric plant additions and improvements for 2011 is $1,015 million which includes RTEP projects. See ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity
and Capital Resources for further information.         
     PECO          
  PECO is engaged principally in the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services to
retail customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services to retail customers in the Pennsylvania counties
surrounding the City of Philadelphia. PECO is a public utility under the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code subject to regulation by the PAPUC as to electric and gas distribution rates and service, the issuances of certain securities and certain other
aspects of PECO s operations. PECO is a public utility under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC as to transmission rates and certain other aspects of PECO s business and by the U.S. Department of Transportation as to
pipeline safety and other aspects of gas operations. Specific operations of PECO are subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies. Additionally, PECO is also subject to NERC mandatory reliability
standards.            PECO s combined electric and natural gas
retail service territory has an area of approximately 2,100 square miles and an estimated population of 3.8 million. PECO provides electric delivery service in an area of approximately 1,900 square miles, with a population of approximately
3.8 million, including approximately 1.5 million in the City of Philadelphia. PECO supplies natural gas service in an area of approximately 1,900 square miles in southeastern Pennsylvania adjacent to the City of Philadelphia, with a
population of approximately 2.3 million. PECO delivers electricity to approximately 1.6 million customers and natural gas to approximately 490,000 customers.   
        PECO has the necessary authorizations to deliver regulated electric and
natural gas service in the various municipalities or territories in which it now supplies such services. PECO s authorizations consist of charter rights and certificates of public convenience issued by the PAPUC and/or  grandfathered
rights,  which are rights generally unlimited as to time and generally exclusive from competition from other electric and natural gas utilities. In a few defined municipalities, PECO s natural gas service territory authorizations overlap
with that of another natural gas utility but PECO does not consider those situations as posing a material competitive or financial threat.         
  PECO s kWh sales and peak electricity load are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand
for either summer cooling or winter heating. PECO s highest peak load occurred on August 3, 2006 and was 8,932 MW; its highest peak load during a winter season occurred on December 20, 2004 and was 6,838 MW.   
        PECO s natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter
months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. PECO s highest daily natural gas send out occurred on January 17, 2000 and was 718 mmcf.   
         15   

Table of Contents  

     Retail Electric Services     
        PECO s retail electric sales and distribution revenues are
derived pursuant to rates regulated by the PAPUC. Under the 1998 restructuring settlement, PECO s electric generation rates were capped through a transition period which ended on December 31, 2010. During the transition period, PECO was
authorized to recover from customers $5.3 billion of costs that might not have otherwise been recovered in a competitive market (stranded costs) with a 10.75% return on the unamortized balance through the imposition and collection of a
non-bypassable CTC, which was a component of the capped electric generation rate on customer bills. At December 31, 2010, PECO s stranded costs were fully recovered.   
        Beginning January 1, 2011, PECO s electric supply procurement
cost rates charged to default service customers are subject to quarterly adjustments designed to recover or refund the difference between PECO s actual cost of electricity delivered and the amount included in rates without markup through the
GSA.            Pennsylvania permits competition by EGSs for the
supply of retail electricity while transmission and distribution service remains regulated under the Competition Act. For the year ended December 31, 2010, less than 1% of PECO s residential and large commercial and industrial and 4% of
its small commercial and industrial loads were purchased from alternative EGSs. The small percentage of customer load provided by an alternative EGS is due to the electric generation rate caps that were lower than current market prices throughout
the transition period. Customers that choose an alternative EGS are not subject to PECO s electric supply procurement cost rates. In preparation for the transition to market-based competitive pricing, multiple alternative EGSs began marketing
to customers in PECO s service territory. As of January 31, 2011, PECO believes that at least 10% of residential, 46% of small commercial and industrial and 86% of large commercial and industrial loads will be purchased from alternative
EGSs. Beginning with January 2011 customer bills, PECO presented its electric supply Price to Compare, which will be updated quarterly, to assist customers with the evaluation of offers from alternative EGSs. PECO s average residential Price to
Compare for the first three months of 2011 is 9.92 cents per kWh.            Customer selection of an alternative EGS or PECO as default service provider does not impact PECO s results of operations or financial position. PECO s cost of electric supply is passed directly through
to default service customers without markup. For those customers that choose an alternative EGS, PECO will act as the billing agent but will not record revenues or expenses related to this electric supply. PECO remains the distribution service
provider for all the customers in its service territory and charges a regulated rate for delivery service. PECO receives transmission revenue from PJM for customers that select an alternative EGS.   
         Procurement Proceedings.  Prior to January 1, 2011, PECO
procured all its electric supply under a full requirements PPA with Generation, which expired on December 31, 2010. The term and procurement costs under the PPA with Generation corresponded with PECO s transition period and capped electric
generation rates in accordance with its 1998 restructuring settlement. Beginning January 1, 2011, PECO s electric supply for its customers is procured through a competitive process in accordance with its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. During
2010, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders for its third and fourth competitive procurements of electric supply for default electric service commencing January 2011, which included fixed price full requirement contracts for all
procurement classes, spot market price full requirements contracts for the commercial and industrial procurement classes, and block energy contracts for the residential procurement class. As of December 31, 2010, including the previous
competitive procurements completed in 2009 and 2010, the 2011 expected electric supply for all customer classes had been substantially procured. PECO will conduct five additional competitive procurements for electric supply for all customer classes
during the term of its DSP Program.

    Electric Distribution Rate Case.  In December 2010, the PAPUC approved a settlement of
PECO s electric distribution rate case filed in August 2010 that provides for an annual revenue increase of $225 million. The approved electric distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2011. The electric distribution rate case
settlement and the electric supply procurement results indicate an increase of 5.1% in the average residential customer total electric bill in January 2011, above 2010 bills.   
        See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.              Smart Meter and Energy Efficiency
Programs               Smart Meter Programs.  In April
2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s $550 million Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan, which was filed in accordance with the requirements of Act 129. PECO filed for PAPUC approval of an initial dynamic pricing and customer acceptance
program in October 2010, and plans to file for approval of a universal meter deployment plan for its remaining customers in 2012.         
  Also, in April 2010, PECO entered into a Financial Assistance Agreement with the DOE for SGIG funds under the ARRA. Under the SGIG, PECO has been
awarded $200 million, the maximum grant allowable under the program, for its SGIG project Smart Future Greater Philadelphia. As a result of the SGIG funding, PECO will deploy 600,000 smart meters within three years, accelerate universal
deployment of more than 1.6 million smart meters from 15 years to 10 years and increase smart grid investments to approximately $100 million over the next three years. In total, over the next 10 years, PECO is planning to spend up to $650
million on its smart grid and smart meter infrastructure. The SGIG funding will be used to significantly reduce the impact of those investments on PECO customers.   
         Energy Efficiency Programs.  In February 2010, the PAPUC approved
PECO s EE C plan, which was filed pursuant to Act 129 s EE C reduction targets. The approved four-year plan totals more than $330 million and includes a CFL program, weatherization programs, an energy efficiency appliance rebate
and trade-in program, rebates and energy efficiency programs for non-profit, educational, governmental and business customers, customer incentives for energy management programs and incentives to help customers reduce energy demand during peak
periods. In September 2010, PECO filed revisions to the EE C Plan previously approved in February 2010 that included adjustments to certain incentive levels and the addition of energy efficiency measures to the existing portfolio. These
revisions do not impact the total spending or timely recovery under the approved EE C plan. On January 27, 2011, the PAPUC unanimously approved PECO s EE C Plan revisions.            See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
          Natural Gas              PECO s natural gas sales and distribution revenues are derived pursuant to rates regulated by the PAPUC. PECO s
purchased natural gas cost rates, which represent a portion of total rates, are subject to quarterly adjustments designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates without
markup through the PGC.            PECO s natural gas customers
have the right to choose their natural gas suppliers or to purchase their gas supply from PECO at cost. In 2010, 39% of PECO s current total yearly throughput was provided by natural gas suppliers other than PECO and is related primarily to the
supply of PECO s large commercial and industrial customers. Natural gas distribution service provided to customers by

PECO remains subject to rate regulation. PECO also provides billing, metering, installation, maintenance and emergency response services at regulated rates.   
         Procurement Proceedings.  PECO s natural gas supply is
provided through purchases from a number of suppliers. These purchases are primarily delivered under long-term firm transportation contracts for terms of up to two years. PECO s aggregate annual firm supply under these firm transportation
contracts is 46 million dekatherms. Peak natural gas is provided by PECO s liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility and propane-air plant. PECO also has under contract 23 million dekatherms of underground storage through service
agreements. Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 30% of PECO s 2010-2011 heating season planned supplies.         
   Natural Gas Distribution Rate Cases.  On January 1, 2009, PECO implemented the natural gas distribution rates approved by the PAPUC in
its settlement of the 2008 natural gas distribution rate case that provided for an additional $77 million of revenue annually. In December 2010, the PAPUC approved a settlement of PECO s natural gas distribution rate case filed in August
2010 that provides an increase in annual revenue of $20 million. The approved natural gas distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2011.         
  See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
          Construction Budget     
        PECO s business is capital intensive and requires significant
investments primarily in energy transmission and distribution facilities to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability and efficiency of its system. Based on PJM s RTEP, PECO has various construction commitments, including costs related to
transmission system reliability upgrades due to Generation s plant retirements, as discussed in Notes 14 and 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. PECO s most recent estimate of capital expenditures for plant
additions and improvements for 2011 is $450 million, which includes capital expenditures related to the smart meter program and SGIG project net of DOE expected reimbursements.   
         ComEd and PECO               Transmission Services           
  ComEd and PECO provide unbundled transmission service under rates established by FERC. FERC has used its regulation of transmission to encourage
competition for wholesale generation services and the development of regional structures to facilitate regional wholesale markets. Under FERC s open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, ComEd and PECO, as owners of
transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. ComEd and PECO are required to comply with FERC s Standards of Conduct regulation, as amended, governing the
communication of non-public information between the transmission owner s employees and wholesale merchant employees.         
  PJM is the ISO and the FERC-approved RTO for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of,
the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff), operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the PJM region. ComEd and PECO are members of
PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. ComEd, PECO and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are currently under the
dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.   
         18

   ComEd s transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC in
January 2008. FERC s order establishes the agreed-upon treatment of costs and revenues in the determination of network service transmission rates and the process for updating the formula rate calculation on an annual basis.   
        As a result of PECO s 1998 restructuring settlement, retail
transmission rates were capped at the level in effect on December 31, 1996, which remained unchanged through December 31, 2010. PECO s transmission rate included in the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff is a FERC-approved rate. This
is the rate that all load serving entities in the PECO transmission zone pay for transmission service. PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement provided for recovery of PJM transmission network service charges and RTEP charges
from default service customers, on a full and current basis through a rider.            See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding transmission services.   
           Employees    
        As of December 31, 2010, Exelon and its subsidiaries had 19,214
employees in the following companies, of which 8,550 or 44% were covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs):         

(a)  
  A separate CBA between ComEd and IBEW Local 15, ratified on November 20, 2009, covers approximately 36 employees in ComEd s System Services Group.

(b)  
  1,258 PECO craft and call center employees in the Philadelphia service territory are covered by CBAs with IBEW Local 614. The CBAs expire on March 31, 2015. Additionally,
Exelon Power, an operating unit of Generation, has an agreement with IBEW Local 614, which expires on March 31, 2015 and covers 199 employees.     

(c)  
  During 2009 and early 2010, CBAs were agreed to with the following Security Officers unions: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, Oyster Creek and TMI. The agreements generally
expire during 2012 except for the agreements at Clinton and Oyster Creek, which expire in 2013. Additionally, during 2009, a 5-year agreement was reached with Oyster Creek Nuclear Local 1289, which will expire in 2015. Also in 2010, a 3-year
agreement was negotiated with New England ENEH, UWUA Local 369, which will expire in 2014, and covers 10 employees.

     Environmental Regulation          
    General           
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO are subject to environmental regulation administered by the U.S. EPA and various state and local environmental
protection agencies or boards. State and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water and noise emissions and solid waste disposals. The Registrants are also subject to legislation regarding environmental matters by the United
States Congress and by various state and local jurisdictions where the Registrants operate their facilities.         
  The Exelon board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address
environmental matters, including the CEO who also serves as Exelon s Chief Environmental Officer; the Vice President, Corporate Strategy and   
         19   

Table of Contents  

Exelon 2020; the Corporate Environmental Strategy Director and the Environmental Regulatory Strategy Director, as well as senior management of Generation, ComEd and PECO. Performance for those
individuals directly involved in environmental strategy activities is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Exelon board has delegated to its corporate governance committee authority to
oversee Exelon s strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including, but not limited to, Exelon s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, and Exelon 2020, Exelon s comprehensive
business and environmental plan, as discussed in further detail below. The Exelon board has also delegated to its generation oversight committee authority to oversee environmental, health and safety issues relating to Generation, and to its energy
delivery oversight committee authority to oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to ComEd, PECO and Exelon Transmission Company.         
    Water           
  Under the Federal Clean Water Act (Clean Water Act), NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the U.S. EPA or
from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. All of Generation s power generation facilities discharge industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to
these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being granted an administrative extension.         
  See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact to Exelon of state permitting
agencies  administration of the Phase II rule implementing Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, as well as the planned cessation of generation operations at Oyster Creek.            Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain other state and regional agencies and compacts, including the
Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.         
    Solid and Hazardous Waste           
  The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the U.S. EPA in the event of threatened releases of
hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. Government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so.
Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are
listed by the U.S. EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with a U.S. EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the U.S. Government concerning their
liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Illinois and Pennsylvania, have also enacted statutes that contain
provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, the RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.   
        Generation, ComEd and PECO and their subsidiaries are or are likely to
become parties to proceedings initiated by the U.S. EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they
may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third party.   
         20   

Table of Contents  

     Environmental Remediation     
        ComEd and PECO s environmental liabilities primarily arise from
contamination at former MGP sites. MGPs manufactured gas in Illinois and Pennsylvania from approximately 1850 to the 1950s. ComEd and PECO generally did not operate MGPs as corporate entities but did acquire MGP sites as part of the absorption of
smaller utilities, for which they may be liable for environmental remediation. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to the joint settlements of the 2008 and 2010 natural gas distribution rate cases, are recovering environmental
remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. PECO s 2010 natural gas distribution rate case increased the annual MGP recovery to be collected from customers beginning in January 2011.   
        The amount to be expended in 2011 at Exelon for compliance with
environmental remediation is expected to total $23 million, consisting of $17 million and $6 million at ComEd and PECO, respectively. In addition, Generation, ComEd and PECO may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently
determinable.            See Notes 2 and 18 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  environmental remediation efforts and related impacts to the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
          Air     
        Air quality regulations promulgated by the U.S.
EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies in Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Amendments) impose restrictions on emission of
particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ), nitrogen oxides (NO   x   ), mercury and other pollutants and require permits for operation of emissions sources. Such
permits have been obtained by Exelon s subsidiaries and must be renewed periodically. The Amendments establish a comprehensive and complex national program to substantially reduce air pollution, including a two-phase program to reduce acid rain
effects by significantly reducing emissions of SO   2    and NO   x    from power plants. Flue-gas desulfurization systems (SO   2    scrubbers) have been installed at all of Generation s coal-fired units.   
        See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding clean air regulation and legislation in the forms of the proposed Transport Rule, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants from fossil generating stations, and regulation of GHG emissions, in addition to NOVs
issued to Generation and ComEd for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.         
    Global Climate Change           
  Exelon believes the evidence of global climate change is compelling and that the energy industry, though not alone, is a
significant contributor to the human-caused emissions of GHGs that many in the scientific community believe contribute to global climate change, as reported by the National Academy of Sciences in May 2010. Exelon, as a producer of electricity from
predominantly low-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, wind and hydroelectric), has a relatively small GHG emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity. By virtue of its significant investment
in low-carbon intensity assets, Generation s emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO   2   e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Exelon does produce GHG emissions, primarily at its fossil fuel-fired generating plants; CO   2   , methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process, with CO   2    representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. GHG emissions from
Generation s combustion of fossil fuels represent approximately 90% of Exelon s total GHG emissions. However, only approximately 6% of Exelon s total electric supply is provided by its fossil fuel generating plants. Other GHG emission
sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the gas pipeline system and the coal piles at its generating plants,   
         21   

Table of Contents  

sulfur hexafluoride (SF   6   )
leakage in its electric operations and refrigerant leakage from its chilling and cooling equipment as well as fossil fuel combustion in its motor vehicles and usage of electricity in its facilities. Despite its small carbon footprint, Exelon
believes its operations could be significantly affected by the possible physical risks of climate change and by mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for information regarding the market and financial, regulatory
and legislative, and operational risks associated with climate change.              Climate Change Regulation.   Exelon is, or may become, subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the international, Federal, regional and state levels.   
         International Climate Change Regulation.  At the
international level, the United States is currently not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, which is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and became effective for signatories on February 16, 2005. The
United Nations  Kyoto Protocol process generally requires developed countries to cap GHG emissions at certain levels during the 2008-2012 time period. At the conclusion of the December 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali,
Indonesia, the Bali Action Plan was adopted, which identifies a work group, process and timeline for the consideration of possible post-2012 international actions to further address climate change. In December 2009, the United States agreed to the
non-binding Copenhagen Accord at the conclusion of the 15th Conference of the Parties under the UNFCCC. Under the Copenhagen Accord, the United States agreed to undertake a number of voluntary measures, including the establishment of a goal to
reduce GHG emissions and contributions toward a fund to assist developing nations to address their GHG emissions. The Conference of the Parties met in Mexico in December 2010 and while some progress was made in the Cancun Agreement, the fundamental
issues around GHG emission reductions and a successor to the Kyoto Protocol remain unresolved. The next Conference of the Parties meeting will be held in December 2011 in South Africa.             Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  Various stakeholders, including Exelon, legislators and
regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors are considering ways to address the climate change issue. Mandatory programs to reduce GHG emissions are likely to evolve in the future.
If these programs become effective, Exelon may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or procure emission allowances or credits.   
        Numerous bills were introduced in Congress during
the 111   th    Congress that address climate change from different perspectives,
including direct regulation of GHG emissions and the establishment of Federal Renewable Portfolio Standards, but none were passed by both houses of Congress. Exelon supports the enactment, through Federal legislation, of a cap-and-trade program for
GHG emissions that is mandatory, economy-wide and designed in a way to limit potential harm to the economy and protect consumers. Exelon believes that any mechanism for allocation of GHG emission allowances should include significant free grants of
allowances to electric (and potentially gas) distribution companies to help offset the cost impact of GHG regulation to the end-use consumer. Over the last few years, Exelon has worked with other businesses and environmental organizations that
participate in the United States Climate Action Partnership to support the development of an integrated package of recommendations for the Federal government to address the climate change issue through Federal legislation, including aggressive
emission reduction targets for total U.S. emissions and robust cost containment measures to ensure that program costs are reasonable. In reaction to the U.S. EPA s proposed regulation of GHG emissions, various bills have been introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives that would prohibit or impede the U.S. EPA s rulemaking efforts. The timing of the consideration of such legislation is unknown.   
        The issue of GHG regulation of stationary sources will likely be
addressed either under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act by U.S. EPA regulation, or by new and comprehensive Federal   
         22   

Table of Contents  

legislation. The Obama administration and the U.S. EPA have stated a preference for addressing the issue through Federal legislation. The extent to which GHG emissions will be regulated is
currently unknown; however, potential regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources could cause Exelon to incur material costs of compliance.         
   Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.  At a regional level, on November 15, 2007, six Midwest state
Governors (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) signed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord. Under that Accord, an inter-state work group was formed to establish a Midwestern GHG Reduction Program that will: (1) establish
GHG reduction targets and timeframes consistent with member state targets; (2) develop a market-based and multi-sector cap-and-trade program to help achieve GHG reductions; and (3) develop other mechanisms and policies to assist in meeting
GHG reduction targets (e.g. a low carbon fuel standard). In May 2010, an advisory group appointed by the Governors issued recommendations, but no actions have been taken on the recommendations.   
        At the state level, the PCCA was signed into law in Pennsylvania in
July 2008. The PCCA requires, among other things, that: a Climate Change Advisory Committee be formed; a report on the potential impact of climate change in Pennsylvania be developed; the PA DEP develop a GHG inventory for Pennsylvania; a voluntary
GHG registry be identified; and the PA DEP, in consultation with the Climate Change Advisory Committee, develop a Climate Change Action Plan for Pennsylvania to be reviewed with the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The Climate Change Advisory
Committee issued its recommendations for an Action Plan for consideration by the Pennsylvania legislature on October 9, 2009.         
   Exelon s Voluntary Climate Change Efforts . In a world increasingly concerned about global climate change, nuclear power as well as other
virtually non-GHG emitting power will play a pivotal role. As a result, Exelon s low-carbon generating fleet is seen by management as a competitive advantage. Exelon believes that the significance of its low GHG emission profile can only grow
as policymakers take action to address global climate change.            Despite Exelon s low GHG emission inventory and the absence of a mandatory national program in the United States, Exelon is actively engaged in voluntary reduction efforts. Exelon made a voluntary commitment
in 2005 under the U.S. EPA s Climate Leaders Program to reduce its GHG emissions by 8% from 2001 levels by the end of 2008. Exelon achieved this goal by reducing its carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO   2   e) emissions to 9.7 million metric tons in 2008, from a 2001 baseline of 15.7 million metric tons. This was accomplished
through the retirement of older, inefficient fossil power plants, reduced leakage of SF   6   , increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives.         
  In 2008, Exelon expanded its commitment to GHG reduction with the announcement of a comprehensive business and environmental strategic
plan. The plan, Exelon 2020, details an enterprise-wide strategy and a wide range of initiatives being pursued by Exelon to reduce Exelon s GHG emissions and those of its customers, communities, suppliers and markets. Exelon 2020 sets
a goal for Exelon to reduce, offset, or displace more than 15 million metric tons of GHG emissions per year by 2020 (from 2001 levels).         
  Through Exelon 2020, Exelon is pursuing three broad strategies: reducing or offsetting its own carbon footprint, helping customers and communities
reduce their GHG emissions, and offering more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. In 2010, Exelon announced that it had achieved just over 50% of the annual Exelon 2020 goal. The planned retirement of fossil units, Cromby Units 1 and 2 and
Eddystone Unit 1 in 2011 and Eddystone Unit 2 in 2012, will further contribute to fully achieving the goal. The early retirement of Oyster Creek may result in increased generation from fossil generating plants in the PJM RTO, which could result in
increased GHG emissions under Exelon 2020 through reverse displacement. The current plan for achieving the Exelon 2020 goal accounts for these events.   
         23   

Table of Contents  

Initiatives to reduce Exelon s own carbon footprint include reducing building energy consumption by 25%, reducing vehicle fleet emissions, improving the efficiency of the generation and
delivery system for electricity and natural gas, and developing an industry-leading green supply chain. Plans to help customers reduce their GHG emissions include ComEd s Smart Ideas portfolio of energy efficiency programs, a similar
portfolio of energy efficiency programs at PECO to meet the requirements of Act 129, the implementation of smart-meters and real-time pricing programs and a broad array of communication initiatives to increase customer awareness of approaches to
manage their energy consumption. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding ComEd and PECO smart grid filings and stimulus grant awards. Finally, Exelon will offer more low-carbon
electricity in the marketplace by increasing its investment in renewable power and adding capacity to existing nuclear plants through uprates.         
  Exelon has incorporated Exelon 2020 into its overall business plans and has an organized implementation effort underway. This implementation
effort includes a periodic review and refinement of Exelon 2020 initiatives in light of changing market conditions. Specific initiatives and the amount of expenditures to implement the plan will depend on economic and policy developments, and will
be made on a project-by-project basis in accordance with Exelon s normal project evaluation standards. As further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of air pollutants are promulgated, Exelon s emissions reduction
efforts will position the company to benefit from the long-term positive impact of the requirements on capacity and energy prices while minimizing the impact of costs of compliance on Exelon s operations, cash flows or financial position.
           The Exelon 2020 strategy is reviewed annually and updated
to reflect changes in the market, regulations, technology and other factors that affect the merit of various GHG abatement options. In spite of the recent economic downturn, the decline in wholesale power prices and the uncertainty of Federal
climate policy, Exelon 2020 has been demonstrated to be a sustainable business strategy.              Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards           
  Thirty-three states have adopted some form of RPS requirement. As previously described, Illinois and Pennsylvania have laws specifically addressing
energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition to state level activity, RPS legislation has been considered and may be considered again in the future by the United States Congress. Also, states that currently do not have RPS
requirements may determine to adopt such legislation in the future.            The Illinois Settlement Legislation required that procurement plans implemented by electric utilities include cost-effective renewable energy resources or approved equivalents such as RECs in amounts that equal or
exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers by June 1, 2008, increasing to 10% by June 1, 2015, with a goal of 25% by June 1, 2025. Utilities are allowed to pass-through any
costs from the procurement of these renewable resources or approved equivalents subject to legislated rate impact criteria. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply
with the Illinois Settlement Legislation. See Note 2 and Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
  The AEPS Act is effective for PECO beginning in 2011, following the expiration of PECO s transition period. During 2011, PECO will be required
to supply approximately 3.5% and 6.2% of electric energy generated from Tier I (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy, coal mine methane and black liquor
generated within Pennsylvania) and Tier II (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing by-products of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems
and integrated combined coal gasification   
         24

technology) alternative energy resources, respectively, as measured in AECs. The compliance requirements will incrementally escalate to 8.0% for Tier I and 10.0% for Tier II by 2021. In order to
prepare for the first year of required compliance, PECO procured and banked AECs in accordance with their PAPUC-approved plan over the past three years. PECO has entered into five-year agreements and ten-year agreements with accepted bidders,
including Generation, to purchase annually 452,000 non-solar and 8,000 solar Tier 1 AECs, respectively. PECO also purchases AECs through its DSP Program full requirement contracts. In November 2010, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC for approval
to procure Tier II AECs to satisfy PECO s compliance requirements for the AEPS reporting years ending 2011 and 2012.         
  Similar to ComEd and PECO, Generation s retail electric business must source a portion of the electric load it serves in IL and PA from
renewable resources or approved equivalents such as RECs. While Generation is not directly affected by RPS or AEPS legislation from a compliance perspective, potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resources
could increase the pace of development of wind and other renewable/alternative energy resources, which could put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity in some markets where Exelon operates generation assets. At the same time,
such developments may present some opportunities for sales of Generation s renewable power, including from Exelon Wind, Generation s hydroelectric and landfill gas generating stations and wind energy PPAs.

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS            
  Each of the Registrants operates in a market and regulatory environment that poses significant risks, many of which are beyond each
Registrant s control. Management of each Registrant regularly meets with the Chief Risk Officer and the RMC, which is comprised of officers of the Registrants, to identify and evaluate the most significant risks of the Registrants 
businesses, and the appropriate steps to manage and mitigate those risks. The Chief Risk Officer and senior executives of the Registrants discuss those risks with the Risk Oversight and Audit Committees of the Exelon Board of Directors and the ComEd
and PECO Boards of Directors. In addition, the Exelon Board of Directors  Generation Oversight and Energy Delivery Oversight Committees, respectively, evaluate risks related to the generation and energy delivery businesses. The risk factors
discussed below may adversely affect one or more of the Registrants  results of operations and cash flows and the market prices of their publicly traded securities. Each of the Registrants has disclosed the material risks known to it to affect
its business at this time. However, there may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may in the future adversely affect its performance or financial condition.
           The Registrants  most significant risks arise as a
consequence of: (1) Generation s position as a predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive wholesale markets, and (2) the role of both ComEd and PECO as operators of electric transmission and distribution systems in
two of the   
         30   

Table of Contents  

largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The Registrants  major risks fall primarily under the following categories:         

Market and Financial Risks.   Exelon s and Generation s market and financial risks include the risk of price fluctuations in the wholesale
power markets. Wholesale power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are driven by factors such as the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas and coal, that drive the wholesale market prices that Generation s
nuclear power plants can command, the rate of expansion of subsidized low carbon generation such as wind energy in the markets in which Generation s output is sold, and the impacts on energy demand of factors such as weather, economic
conditions and implementation of energy efficiency and demand response programs.            

Regulatory and Legislative Risks.   The Registrants regulatory and legislative risks include changes to the laws and regulations that govern
competitive markets and utility cost recovery, and that drive environmental policy. In particular, Exelon s and Generation s financial performance may be adversely affected by changes that could affect Generation s ability to sell
power into the competitive wholesale power markets at market-based prices. In addition, potential regulation and legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standards could increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities,
which could put downward pressure in some markets on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation s nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets
under a carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future.            

Operational Risks.   The Registrants operational risks include those risks inherent in running the nation s largest fleet of nuclear power
reactors and large electric and gas distribution systems. The safe and effective operation of the nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations as well as the ability to maintain the
availability, reliability and safety of its energy delivery systems are fundamental to Exelon s ability to protect and grow shareholder value. Additionally, the operating costs of ComEd and PECO and the opinions of customers and regulators of
ComEd and PECO are affected by those companies  ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery systems.            
  A discussion of each of these risks and other risk factors is included below.   
          Market and Financial Risks     
         Generation is exposed to price fluctuations in the wholesale power market, which
may negatively affect its results of operations. (Exelon and Generation)             Generation hedges the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls through long-term power purchase agreements. Absent any hedging activity through long-term, fixed price transactions, Generation
would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices in the markets in which its assets are located, which would mean that Generation s cash flows would vary accordingly.            The wholesale spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying
the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Many times, the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating stations fueled by fossil fuels, and, therefore, the market price of power will reflect the market price of the
marginal fuel. As such, changes in the market price of fossil fuels will cause comparable changes to the market price of power. For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is expected to increase natural gas
supply and reserves, which will tend to place further downward pressure on natural gas prices and could reduce Generation s revenue, and, therefore, adversely affect the its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, in
the event that alternative generation resources, such as wind   
         31   

Table of Contents  

and solar, are mandated through RPS or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation and added to the supply, they could displace a higher marginal cost fossil
plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region, including Generation, would sell their output.   
        The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the
demand for electricity. Poorer than expected economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs can depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as
frequently, putting downward pressure on market prices for electricity. The continued sluggish economy in the United States has in fact led to a slow down in the growth of demand for electricity. If this continues, it could adversely affect the
Registrants  ability to pay dividends or fund other discretionary uses of cash such as growth projects. A slow recovery could result in a prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity prices, which could also adversely affect
Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.             In addition to price fluctuations, Generation is exposed to other risks of the wholesale power market that are beyond its control and may negatively affect its results of operations. (Exelon and Generation)
              Credit Risk.   In the bilateral markets,
Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money, or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to
these arrangements fail to perform, Generation might be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In
the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTO s and ISO s, the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participants. Generation
is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, the retail businesses subject Generation to credit risk through competitive electricity and
natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a
customer s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.         
    Unstable Markets.   The wholesale spot markets remain evolving markets that vary from region to region and are still developing
practices and procedures. Problems in or the failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect
on market stability.             Market performance and other factors may decrease
the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets and increase the related obligations, which then could require significant additional funding. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived
effects on particular businesses and the greater economy may adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation s NDTs and Exelon s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas
and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants  projected return rates. A decline in the market value
of the NDT fund investments may increase the funding requirements to decommission Generation s nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements
associated   
         32   

Table of Contents  

with Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest
rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also
increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets or other factors are not recoverable
from ComEd and PECO customers, the results of operations and financial positions of ComEd and PECO could be negatively affected. Ultimately, if the Registrants are unable to manage the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets and
obligations, their results of operations and financial positions could be negatively affected.             Unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets may adversely affect the Registrants  businesses in several ways, including the availability and cost of short-term funds
for liquidity requirements, the Registrants  ability to meet long-term commitments, Generation s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy markets; each could adversely affect
the Registrants  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  The Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet
their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from the Registrants  respective operations. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets can adversely affect the Registrants  ability to
access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The Registrants  access to funds under those credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their
funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from the Registrants and other
borrowers within a short period of time. Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in
the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, changes to Generation s hedging strategy to reduce collateral-posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash.   
        In addition, the credit facilities for Exelon, Generation and PECO
largely expire in October 2012. Exelon anticipates refinancing these credit facilities, approximately $6.4 billion, in the first half of 2011. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants  ability to
secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. The Registrants may choose to establish cost-effective alternative liquidity sources as appropriate.   
        The strength and depth of competition in competitive energy markets
depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that may affect participants in commodities
transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the
Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the
requirement of long-term contracts such as the financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd as described further in Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which could have a material adverse effect on
Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and cash flows.   
         33

    If any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or
otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of its trading counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs. (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Generation s trading
business is subject to credit quality standards that may require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating)
or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under trading agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity.
The amount of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time is dependent on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of trading positions, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and
(3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Generation could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the
credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry or Generation has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could
also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation.         
  ComEd s financial swap contract with Generation and its operating agreement with PJM contain collateral provisions that are affected by its
credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions exist and ComEd were to lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required under the financial swap contract with
Generation to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. Collateral posting by ComEd under the financial swap will generally increase as forward market prices fall and
decrease as forward market prices rise. Conversely, collateral requirements under the PJM operating agreement will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Given the relationship to market prices, contract
collateral requirements can be volatile. In addition, if ComEd were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.         
  PECO s operating agreement with PJM and its power and natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by its
credit rating. If certain wholesale market conditions exist and PECO were to lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash,
which may have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. PECO s collateral requirements relating to its natural gas supply contracts are a function of market prices. Collateral posting requirements for PECO with respect to these contracts
will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. Given the relationship to forward market prices, contract collateral requirements can be volatile. In addition, if PECO were downgraded, it could
experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.            Either or both ComEd and PECO could experience a downgrade in its ratings if any of the credit rating agencies concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility
industry in general or ComEd or PECO in particular has deteriorated. ComEd or PECO could experience a downgrade if the current regulatory environments in Illinois and Pennsylvania become less predictable by materially lowering returns for utilities
in the applicable state or adopting other measures to mitigate higher electricity prices. Additionally, the ratings for ComEd or PECO could be downgraded if either company s financial results are weakened from current levels due to weaker
operating performance or due to a failure to properly manage its capital structure. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of ComEd or PECO.   
         34   

Table of Contents  

   ComEd and PECO conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other
arrangements and procedures intended to assure that ComEd and PECO are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate ComEd and PECO from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the
event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as  ringfencing ) may help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of ComEd and PECO in the event of a reduction in the
credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ringfencing measures, the credit ratings of ComEd or PECO could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a
reduction of the credit rating of ComEd or PECO, or both. A reduction in the credit rating of ComEd or PECO could have a material adverse effect on ComEd or PECO, respectively.   
        See Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Market Conditions and
Security Ratings for further information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants  cash flows.         
   Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by price volatility, availability and other risk factors associated with the procurement of
nuclear and fossil fuel. (Exelon and Generation)          
  Generation depends on nuclear fuel, coal, natural gas and oil to operate its generating facilities. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through
long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. Coal, natural gas and oil are procured for generating plants through annual, short-term and
spot-market purchases. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, coal, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions and counterparty default that may negatively affect the results of operations for Generation.
            Generation s risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the
risk associated with its commodity trading activities. (Exelon and Generation)             Generation s asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation attempts to
manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when
its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect.
Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot
predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions may have on its business, operating results or financial position.         
  Generation buys and sells energy and other products in the wholesale markets and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various
positions in Generation s power generation portfolio. The proportion of hedged positions in its power generation portfolio may cause volatility in Generation s future results of operations.   
         35

    Generation may not be able to effectively respond to increased demand for energy. (Exelon and Generation)
            Generation s financial growth may depend in part
on its ability to respond to increased demand for energy. If demand for electricity rises in the future, it may be necessary for the market to increase capacity through the construction of new generating facilities. Development by Generation of new
generating facilities would require the commitment of substantial capital resources, including access to the capital markets. The wholesale markets for electricity and certain states  statutes contemplate that future generation will be built in
those markets at the risk of market participants. Thus, the ability of Generation to recover the costs of and to earn an adequate return on any future investment in generating facilities will be dependent on its ability to build, finance and
efficiently operate facilities that are competitive in those markets. Additionally, construction of new generating facilities by Generation in markets in which it currently competes would be subject to market concentration tests administered by
FERC. If Generation cannot pass these tests administered by FERC, it could be limited in how it responds to increased demand for energy.         
   Financial performance and load requirements may be adversely affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio. (Exelon and Generation)
            A significant portion of Generation s power
portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with ComEd, PECO and other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation s output is sold in the wholesale market. To the
extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation s financial results may be negatively affected if it
is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio and effectively handle the changes in the wholesale power markets.   
         Challenges to tax positions taken by the Registrants as well as tax law changes and
the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact the Registrants  results of operations and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
          1999 sale of fossil generating assets.   The IRS has
challenged Exelon s 1999 tax position on an involuntary conversion and like-kind exchange transaction. In the third quarter of 2010, Exelon and IRS Appeals reached a nonbinding, preliminary agreement to settle Exelon s involuntary
conversion and CTC positions and for the IRS to withdraw its assertion of a $110 million substantial understatement penalty related to the involuntary conversion position. However, Exelon and IRS Appeals failed to reach a settlement on the like-kind
exchange position. Exelon expects to initiate litigation on this matter during the second half of 2011. If the IRS is successful in its challenge to the like-kind exchange position, it would accelerate future income tax payments and increase
interest expense related to the deferred tax gain that would become currently payable. As of December 31, 2010, Exelon s and ComEd s potential cash outflow, including tax and interest (after tax), could be as much as
$830 million, excluding penalties. If the deferral were successfully challenged by the IRS, Exelon s and ComEd s results of operations could also be negatively impacted by up to $230 million (after tax) related to interest
expense. In addition to attempting to impose tax on the like-kind exchange position, the IRS has asserted penalties for a substantial understatement of tax, which could result in an after-tax charge of $86 million to Exelon s and ComEd s
results of operations should the IRS prevail in asserting the penalties. The timing effects of the final resolution of the like-kind exchange matter are unknown. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.   
         36

     Tax reserves and the recoverability of deferred tax assets.   The Registrants are required
to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax matters. These judgments
include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. The Registrants also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of
carryforwards and tax credits. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.         
   Increases in customer rates and the impact of economic downturns may lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. Additionally, increased rates
could lead to decreased volumes delivered. Both of these factors may decrease ComEd s and PECO s results from operations and cash flows. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)    
        ComEd s current procurement plan includes purchasing power
through contracted suppliers and the spot market. PECO began procuring power at market-based rates through contracted suppliers and the spot market on January 1, 2011 following the end of its transition period. ComEd s and PECO s
costs of purchased power are charged to customers without a return or profit component. For PECO, purchased natural gas costs are charged to customers with no return or profit component. Purchased power and natural gas prices fluctuate based on
their relevant supply and demand. Significantly higher rates related to purchased power and natural gas can result in declines in customer usage, lower electric transmission and distribution revenues and potentially additional uncollectible accounts
expense for ComEd and PECO as well as lower gas distribution revenues for PECO. Also, ComEd s and PECO s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate
recovery from customers.            In addition to increased purchased
power charges for ComEd and PECO customers and purchased natural gas costs for PECO customers, the impact of economic downturns on ComEd and PECO s customers, such as unemployment for residential customers and less demand for products and
services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations may result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances, which would negatively impact
ComEd s and PECO s results from operations and cash flows. See ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion of the Registrants  credit risk.   
         The effects of weather may impact the Registrants  results of operations and
cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels
in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues. Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms may stress
ComEd s and PECO s transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company s ability to meet peak customer demand. These extreme conditions may have detrimental effects on
ComEd s and PECO s results of operations and cash flows.            Generation s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than
assumed, Generation may require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms may affect the availability of generation and its transmission,   
         37

limiting Generation s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions can impact Generation s ability to run certain generating assets at full
capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may have an adverse effect by causing Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when those markets
are weak.             Certain long-lived assets recorded on the Registrants 
statements of financial position may become impaired, which would result in write-offs of the impaired amounts. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants  statement of financial position. Specifically, long-lived assets
account for 57%, 48%, 58% and 63% of total assets for Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The Registrants evaluate for impairment the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever
indications of impairment exist. Factors such as the business climate, including current energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment. An
impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the long-lived asset through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment, and such an impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations.
           Exelon holds certain investments in coal-fired plants in
Georgia and Texas subject to long-term leases extending through 2028-2032. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of these leased assets to determine whether any indications of impairment exist. In determining the
estimate of residual value, the expectation of future market conditions, including commodity prices, is considered. An impairment would require Exelon to reduce the value of its investment in the plants through a non-cash charge to expense. Such an
impairment could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s results of operations.            Exelon and ComEd had approximately $2.6 billion of goodwill recorded at December 31, 2010 in connection with the merger between PECO and Unicom Corporation, the former parent company of ComEd. Under GAAP,
goodwill remains at its recorded amount unless it is determined to be impaired, which is generally based upon an annual analysis that compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the
impaired goodwill will be written-off and expensed, reducing equity. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments will depend on many sensitive, interrelated and uncertain variables. Adverse regulatory actions or a fully successful IRS
challenge to Exelon s and ComEd s like-kind exchange income tax position in combination with changes in significant assumptions used in estimating ComEd s fair value (e.g., discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance
and transactions, operating and capital expenditure requirements and the fair value of debt) could result in an impairment. Such an impairment would result in a non-cash charge to expense, which could have a material impact on Exelon s and
ComEd s operating results.            See ITEM 7.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Notes 5 and 7 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on
long-lived asset and goodwill impairments.             The Registrants 
businesses are capital intensive and the costs of capital projects may be significant. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation and in other internal transmission
and distribution infrastructure projects. The Registrants

results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. See
Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Registrants  potential future capital expenditures.         
   Exelon and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance. (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO)             The Registrants have
issued certain guarantees of the performance of others, which obligate Exelon and its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, the Registrants could incur
substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Due to its
significant contractual agreements with ComEd, Generation will be negatively affected in the event of non-performance or change in the creditworthiness of ComEd. (Exelon and Generation)             Generation currently provides power under procurement contracts with ComEd for a significant portion of ComEd s
electricity supply requirements. In addition, Generation entered into a financial swap contract with ComEd, effective August 2007, to hedge a portion of ComEd s electricity supply requirements through May 2013. Consequently, Generation is
highly dependent on ComEd s continued payments under these procurement contracts and would be adversely affected by negative events affecting these agreements, including the non-performance or a significant change in the creditworthiness of
ComEd. A default by ComEd under these agreements would have an adverse effect on Generation s results of operations and financial position.         
   Generation s business may be negatively affected by competitive electric generation suppliers. (Exelon and Generation)    
        Because retail customers where Generation serves load can switch from
their respective energy delivery company to a competitive electric generation supplier for their energy needs, planning to meet Generation s obligation to provide the supply needed to serve Generation s share of an electric distribution
companies  default service obligation is more difficult than planning for retail load before the advent of retail competition. Before retail competition, the primary variables affecting projections of load were weather and the economy. With
retail competition, another major factor is the ability of retail customers to switch to competitive electric generation suppliers. If fewer of such customers switch from its retail load serving counterparties than Generation anticipates, the load
that Generation must serve will be greater than anticipated, which could, if market prices have increased, increase Generation s costs (due to its need to go to market to cover its incremental supply obligation) more than the increase in
Generation s revenues. If more customers switch than Generation anticipates, the load that Generation must serve will be lower than anticipated, which could, if market prices have decreased, cause Generation to lose opportunities in the market.
             Regulatory and Legislative Risks     
         The Registrants  generation and energy delivery businesses are highly
regulated and could be subject to adverse regulatory and legislative actions. Fundamental changes in regulation or legislation could disrupt the Registrants  business plans and adversely affect their operations and financial results. (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Substantially all aspects
of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation. Further, Exelon s and Generation s operating results and   
         39   

Table of Contents  

cash flows are heavily dependent upon the ability of Generation to sell power at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates, and Exelon s, ComEd s
and PECO s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on their ability to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customers. In the planning and management of operations, the Registrants must
address the effects of regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by Federal and state legislatures, RTOs, ratemaking agencies and taxing authorities. Fundamental changes in regulations or other
adverse legislative actions impacting the Registrants  businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations and could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial position.   
        Regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change and
RPS may also significantly affect Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change through GHG emission reductions, if enacted,
could result in increased costs to entities that generate electricity through carbon-emitting fossil fuels, which could increase the market price at which all generators in that region, including Generation, may sell their output, thereby increasing
the revenue Generation could realize from its low-carbon nuclear assets. However, regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an RPS could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facilities in the Midwest, which could
put downward pressure on wholesale market prices for electricity from Generation s Midwest nuclear assets, partially offsetting any additional value Exelon and Generation might derive from Generation s nuclear assets under a carbon
constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.   
         Generation may be negatively affected by possible Federal or state legislative or
regulatory actions that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets. (Exelon and Generation)          
  Federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are facing pressures to address consumer concerns that energy prices in wholesale markets are
too high because the competitive model is not working, and are therefore facing calls for some form of re-regulation or some other means of reducing wholesale market prices. As the energy markets continue to mature, a low number of wholesale market
power participants entering procurement proceedings may also influence how certain regulators and legislators view the effectiveness of these competitive markets.   
        The criticism of restructured electricity markets, which has escalated
in recent years as retail rate freezes have expired, is expected to continue in 2011. Generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy markets to achieve its business objectives.   
        Approximately 80% of Generation s generating resources, which
include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the region encompassed by PJM. Generation s future results of operations will depend on (1) FERC s continued adherence to and support for
policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets, such as the PJM s, and (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect the competitiveness of the PJM
market. Generation could also be adversely affected by efforts of state legislatures, such as the New Jersey Capacity Legislation enacted into law on January 28, 2011 and other states seeking to enact similar programs, and regulatory
authorities to respond to the concerns of consumers or others about the costs of energy that are reflected through wholesale markets.         
  In addition, FERC s application of its Order 697 and its subsequent revisions could pose a risk that Generation will have difficulty satisfying
FERC s tests for market-based rates. Since Order 697 became   
         40   

Table of Contents  

final in June 2007, Generation has obtained orders affirming Generation s authority to sell at market-based rates and none denying that authority. Generation s next submission seeking
reauthorization to sell at market-based rates was filed on December 30, 2010 for the PJM region. In its filing, Generation submitted studies showing that it continues to satisfy the tests required by Order 697. Should FERC take a more stringent
tack with respect to Order 697 applications, it is possible that Generation s authority to sell at market-based rates could be in doubt. Generation, however, currently expects that FERC will approve its pending application.   
        On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law.
Dodd-Frank calls for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC and the Federal Reserve to regulate the market for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative products. Currently, rulemakings are pending at these agencies, the product of which
will be rules that implement the mandates in Dodd-Frank to eliminate the risk of systemic failure of financial markets. The significance of the effect on Generation will depend in part on whether it is determined to be a swap dealer or a qualifying
end-user, based on the meaning of those terms established in the final rules. If Generation is deemed a swap dealer, it will be required execute bilateral OTC derivative transactions through an exchange or central clearinghouse. This could require
Generation to tie up substantial additional capital in order to satisfy exchange-based margin requirements.         
  Even if Generation is not deemed a swap dealer, the rules could impose burdens on market participants to such an extent that liquidity in the
bilateral OTC derivative market decreases substantially. As Generation s hedging program relies heavily on its ability to trade actively in the current bilateral OTC derivatives market, the effect of the new rules could significantly impede
Generation s ability to meet its hedge targets. Generation continues to monitor the rulemaking procedures and cannot predict the ultimate outcome that the financial reform legislation will have on its results of operation, cash flows or
financial position.             Generation s affiliation with ComEd and PECO,
together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation s physical asset base within the ComEd and PECO service territories, could increase Generation s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges
regarding ComEd and/or PECO retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation. (Exelon and Generation)    
        Generation has significant generating resources within the service
areas of ComEd and PECO and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of Generation s
affiliation with ComEd and PECO and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups may question or challenge costs
incurred by ComEd or PECO, including transactions between Generation, on the one hand, and ComEd or PECO, on the other hand, regardless of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The prospect of such challenges
may increase the time, complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges may subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition,
government officials and legislators may seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes and contributions to rate-relief packages.   
         The Registrants may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to
environmental and other matters. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             The businesses in which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in
  
         41   

Table of Contents  

which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These regulations affect how the Registrants handle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of
these emission and disposal requirements can subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and
exposure to third parties  claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental
contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Registrants have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance, site
remediation and clean-up. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies is one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where
hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.         
  If application of Section 316(b), which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic organisms at existing
generating stations, requires the retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this development could result in material costs of compliance. On December 8, 2010, pursuant to discussions with the NJDEP
regarding the application of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act to Oyster Creek, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019, ten years before the expiration of its
operating license in 2029.            Additionally, Generation is
subject to exposure for asbestos-related personal injury liability alleged at certain current and formerly owned generation facilities. Future legislative action could require Generation to make a material contribution to a fund to settle
lawsuits for alleged asbestos-related disease and exposure.         
  In some cases, a third party who has acquired assets from a Registrant has assumed the liability the Registrant may otherwise have for environmental
matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee fails to discharge the assumed liability, a regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold the Registrant responsible, and the Registrant s remedies against the
transferee may be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Changes in ComEd s and PECO s terms and conditions of service, including
their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which may introduce time
delays in effectuating rate changes. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)             ComEd and PECO are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple
parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The proceedings
generally have timelines that may not be limited by statute. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that
rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for ComEd or PECO to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators,
whereby various portions of rates can be adjusted, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.
  
         42   

Table of Contents  

   In certain instances, ComEd and PECO may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate
matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.         
  ComEd and PECO cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by Illinois, Pennsylvania or Federal regulators for
establishing rates, including the extent, if any, to which certain costs such as significant capital projects will be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed. Nevertheless, the expectation is that ComEd and PECO will continue to be
obligated to deliver electricity to customers in their respective service territories and will also retain significant POLR and default service obligations to provide electricity and natural gas to certain groups of customers in its service area who
do not choose an alternative supplier. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of ComEd and PECO, as applicable, to recover their costs and could have a material adverse effect on
ComEd s and PECO s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on appeals in connection with ComEd s 2007 Illinois electric
distribution rate case.             Federal or additional state RPS and/or energy
conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers, could negatively affect the results of operations and cash flows of ComEd and PECO. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)             Changes to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and
alternate fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could significantly impact ComEd and PECO, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed. The impact could include increased costs for RECs and purchased power and increased
rates for customers.            Federal and state legislation
mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, have increased capital expenditures and could significantly impact ComEd and PECO, if timely cost
recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of
Exelon, ComEd and PECO. For additional information, see ITEM 1. Business  Environmental Regulation-Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards .   
         ComEd and PECO are likely to be subject to higher transmission operating costs in
the future as a result of PJM s RTEP. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)             Uncertainties exist as to the construction of new transmission facilities, their cost and how those costs will be allocated to transmission system participants and customers. In accordance with a FERC order and
related settlement, PJM s RTEP requires the costs of new transmission facilities to be allocated across the entire PJM footprint for new facilities greater than or equal to 500 kV, and requires costs of new facilities less than 500 kV to be
allocated to the beneficiaries of the new facilities. On August 6, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit remanded to FERC its decision related to allocation of new facilities 500 kV and above for further proceedings. See Notes
2 and 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             The impact of not meeting the criteria of the FASB guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation could be material to Exelon, ComEd and PECO. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)    
        As of December 31, 2010, Exelon, ComEd and PECO have concluded
that the operations of ComEd and PECO meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of their
  
         43   

Table of Contents  

businesses no longer meets the criteria, Exelon, ComEd and PECO are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of their business. That action would include
the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in their Consolidated Balance Sheets and the recognition of a one-time extraordinary item in their Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impact of not
meeting the criteria of the authoritative guidance could be material to the financial statements of Exelon, ComEd and PECO. At December 31, 2010, the extraordinary gain could have been as much as $1.8 billion (before taxes) as a result of the
elimination of ComEd s regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2010, the extraordinary charge could have been as much as $534 million (before taxes) as a result of the elimination of PECO s regulatory assets and
liabilities. Exelon would record the same amount of extraordinary gain and charge related to ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively. Further, Exelon would record a charge against OCI (before taxes) of up to $2.7
billion and $45 million for ComEd and PECO, respectively, related to Exelon s regulatory assets associated with its defined benefit postretirement plans. The impacts and resolution of the above items could lead to an additional impairment of
ComEd s goodwill, which could be significant and at least partially offset the extraordinary gain discussed above. A significant decrease in equity as a result of any changes could limit the ability of ComEd and PECO to pay dividends under
Federal and state law and cause significant volatility in future results of operations. See Notes 1, 2 and 7 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounting for the effects of regulation,
regulatory matters and ComEd s goodwill, respectively.             Exelon and
Generation may incur material costs of compliance if Federal and/or state regulation or legislation is adopted to address climate change. (Exelon and Generation)    
        Various stakeholders, including legislators and
regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as other companies in many business sectors, including utilities, are considering ways to address the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. In 2009, select Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic states implemented a model rule, developed via the RGGI, to regulate CO   2    emissions from fossil-fired generation. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, Exelon and Generation may incur costs either to limit further the GHG emissions from their operations or to
procure emission allowance credits. The nature and extent of environmental regulation may also impact the ability of Exelon and its subsidiaries to meet the GHG emission reduction targets of Exelon 2020. For example, more stringent permitting
requirements may preclude the construction of lower-carbon nuclear and gas-fired power plants. Similarly, a Federal RPS could increase the cost of compliance by mandating the purchase or construction of more expensive supply alternatives. For more
information regarding climate change, see  Global Climate Change  in ITEM 1 of this Form 10-K and Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K.   
         The Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to
mandatory reliability standards. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation, ComEd and PECO, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by
NERC and enforced by FERC. PECO as operator of a natural gas distribution system is also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to
ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards may subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital
expenditures. In addition, the ICC and PAPUC impose certain distribution reliability standards on ComEd and PECO, respectively. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to
remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.   
         44

    The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to their business activities. An
adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising out of their business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures
that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants  results of operations.              Operational Risks               The
Registrants  employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Employees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and
customers and the general public may be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at risk for serious injury, including loss of
life. Significant risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.        
   War, acts and threats of terrorism, natural disaster, pandemic and other significant events may adversely affect Exelon s results of operations, its ability
to raise capital and its future growth. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Exelon does not know the impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry in general and on Exelon in particular. As owner-operators of infrastructure facilities, such as nuclear, fossil and
hydroelectric generation facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities, Exelon faces a risk that its operations would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or
sustained military campaign may affect its operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Additionally, natural disasters and other events that have an adverse
effect on the economy in general may adversely affect Exelon s operations and its ability to raise capital. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other
factors also may affect Exelon s results of operations and its ability to raise capital. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.   
        Further, the physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or
more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, sea level rise and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of the Registrant s operations. Severe
weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants  service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing
disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. Finally, climate change could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for
Exelon s and Generation s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units.         
  Exelon would be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the
severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected, resulting in decreased service levels and increased
costs.

    Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and
operation of nuclear facilities. (Exelon and Generation)          
    Nuclear capacity factors.   Capacity factors, particularly nuclear capacity factors, significantly affect Generation s results
of operations. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs but produce electricity at low variable costs due to nuclear fuel costs typically being lower than fossil fuel costs. Consequently, to be successful, Generation must
consistently operate its nuclear facilities at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase Generation s operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional
energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation s obligations to committed third-party sales, including ComEd and PECO. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear
stations.              Nuclear refueling
outages.   Refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and currently average approximately 26 days in duration for the nuclear plants operated by Generation. The total number of refueling outages, along
with their duration, can have a significant impact on Generation s results of operations. When refueling outages at wholly and co-owned plants last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease
and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales. Each 26-day outage, depending on the capacity of the station, will decrease the total nuclear annual capacity factor between 0.3% and 0.5%.
             Nuclear fuel quality   .  The quality
of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation can affect the efficiency and costs of Generation s operations. Certain of Generation s nuclear units have previously had a limited number of fuel performance issues. Remediation actions could result
in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.         
    Spent nuclear fuel storage.   The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain,
Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs. Through the NRC s  waste
confidence  rule, the NRC has determined that, if necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmental impacts for at least 60 years beyond the licensed life for operation, which may include
the term of a revised or renewed license of that reactor, at its spent fuel storage basin or at either onsite or offsite independent spent fuel storage installations. Any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for
SNF may adversely affect Generation s ability to decommission fully its nuclear units. Furthermore, under its contract with the DOE, Generation would be required to pay the DOE a one-time SNF storage fee including interest of approximately $1
billion as of December 31, 2010, prior to the first delivery of SNF. Generation currently estimates 2020 to be the earliest date when the DOE will begin accepting SNF, which could be delayed by further regulatory action. See Note 18 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the spent nuclear fuel obligation.         
    License renewals.   Generation cannot assure that economics will support the continued operation of the facilities for all or any
portion of any renewed license period. If the NRC does not renew the operating licenses for Generation s nuclear stations or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could be
adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. In
addition, Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.

   Should a national policy for the disposal of SNF not be developed, the unavailability of a repository
for SNF could become a consideration by the NRC during future nuclear license renewal proceedings, including applications for new licenses.         
    Regulatory risk   .  The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for
failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital
expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and significantly affect Generation s results of operations or financial position. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, may
cause the NRC to initiate such actions.              Operational
risk   .  Operations at any of Generation s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation has to shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting
the causes may require significant time and expense. Generation may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation may lose revenue and incur increased fuel
and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. For plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation may also incur liability to the co-owners. For the plant not wholly owned by Generation and operated by PSEG, Salem Units 1
and 2, from which Generation receives its share of the plant s output, Generation s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the co-owner operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at
those plants. Additionally, poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy, which could significantly affect Generation s results of
operations or financial position. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of their operations, could have effects on transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity
in markets served by Generation.              Nuclear major
incident risk.   Although the safety record of nuclear reactors generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the United States and abroad. The consequences of a major incident can be severe and
include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned by Generation or owned by others, may exceed Generation s resources, including insurance coverage. Uninsured
losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation and could have a material adverse effect on Generation s results of operations or financial position. Additionally, an
accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the United States, owned by others or Generation, may result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy and significantly affect Generation s
results of operations or financial position. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of nuclear insurance.   
          Nuclear insurance.   As required by the Price-Anderson Act,
Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance. As of January 1, 2011, the required amount of nuclear liability insurance is $375 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through
mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $12.6 billion limit for a single incident.   
        Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL,
which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation s nuclear operations. In recent years, NEIL has made distributions to its members but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will
continue at all.   
         47

     Decommissioning.   NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities
demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for
Generation s two units that have been retired) addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC-estimated funding levels including scheduled contributions to and earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. The NRC funding levels are based
upon the assumption that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit.         
  Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results
may differ significantly from current estimates. The performance of capital markets also can significantly affect the value of the trust funds. Currently, Generation is making contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on
amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to Generation. While Generation has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional
amounts from ComEd customers or from the previous owners of Clinton, TMI Unit No. 1 and Oyster Creek generating stations, if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation were unable
to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds
for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former PECO units may be negatively affected. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        Ultimately, if the investments held by Generation s NDTs are not
sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation s nuclear plants, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or make additional contributions to
the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Generation s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected. See
Note 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Generation s financial performance may be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities. (Exelon and Generation)    
        FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal
hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. The license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project expires August 31, 2014, and the license for the Muddy Run Pumped Storage
Project expires on September 1, 2014. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed license of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not renew the operating licenses for Generation s
hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs,
since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. Generation may also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In
addition, conditions may be imposed as part of the license renewal process that may adversely affect operations, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating costs and significantly affect
Generation s results of operations or financial position. Similar effects may result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by
Generation.

    ComEd s and PECO s operating costs, and customers  and regulators  opinions of ComEd and PECO,
are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery systems. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)          
  Failures of the equipment or facilities used in ComEd s and PECO s delivery systems can interrupt the electric transmission and electric
and natural gas delivery, which could negatively impact related revenues, and increase maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including weather. Those failures or those of other
utilities, including prolonged or repeated failures, can affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and ComEd s and PECO s maintenance and capital expenditures. Regulated utilities, which are required to provide
service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd can be required to pay damages to its
customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers.             ComEd s and PECO s respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs and their capital expenditures may be negatively affected by transmission congestion. (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)
            Demand for electricity within ComEd s and
PECO s service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations. Also, insufficient availability
of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize ComEd and PECO s ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission
capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring ComEd and PECO to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.   
         Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce may negatively
impact the Registrants  results of operations. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the
Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may
rise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and distribution operations. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract
and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be negatively affected.             The Registrants are subject to information security risks. (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  The Registrants face information security risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. A security breach of
the Registrants  information systems could impact the reliability of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject them to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain
types of information. The Registrants cannot accurately assess the probability that a security breach may occur, despite the measures taken by the Registrants to prevent such a breach, and are unable to quantify the potential impact of such an
event.

    The Registrants may make acquisitions that do not achieve the intended financial results. (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd and PECO)             The Registrants may make investments
and pursue mergers and acquisitions that fit their strategic objectives and improve their financial performance. It is possible that FERC or state public utility commission regulations may impose certain other restrictions on such transactions.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of an investment is subject to a number of uncertainties, and failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined
company and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

  Base-load units are plants that normally operate to take all or part of the minimum continuous load of a system, and consequently, produce electricity at an essentially constant
rate. Intermediate units are plants that normally operate to take load of a system during the daytime higher load hours, and consequently, produce electricity by cycling on and off daily. Peaking units consist of lower-efficiency, quick response
steam units, gas turbines and diesels normally used during the maximum load periods.

         Dividends    
        Under applicable Federal law, Generation, ComEd and PECO can pay
dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at Generation, ComEd or PECO may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to Exelon.            The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility  to participate
in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital account  is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related
regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on
the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the
subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.            Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and
proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event
that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities
of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued.         
  PECO s Articles of Incorporation prohibit payment of any dividend on, or other distribution to the holders of, common stock if, after giving
effect thereto, the capital of PECO represented by its common stock together with its retained earnings is, in the aggregate, less than the involuntary liquidating value of its then outstanding preferred securities. At December 31, 2010, such
capital was $2.9 billion and amounted to about 33 times the liquidating value of the outstanding preferred securities of $87 million.         
  PECO may not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment
periods on the subordinated debentures which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO
Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued.         
  At December 31, 2010, Exelon had retained earnings of $9,304 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $2,633 million,
ComEd s retained earnings of $331 million consisting of retained earnings appropriated for future dividends of $1,970 million, partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficits, and PECO s retained earnings of $522
million.

   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                  Exelon          
     General          
  Exelon, a utility services holding company, operates through the following principal subsidiaries each of which is treated as a reportable segment:

Generation,  whose business consists of its owned and contracted electric generating facilities, its wholesale energy marketing operations and competitive
retail sales operations.            

ComEd,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services in
northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago.            

PECO,  whose business consists of the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services in
southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, as well as the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.
              See Note 20 of the Combined Notes to

  Through its business services subsidiary BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost. The costs of these
services are directly charged or allocated to the applicable business segments. Additionally, the results of Exelon s corporate operations include costs for corporate governance and interest costs and income from various investment and
financing activities.             Exelon Corporation    
           Executive Overview    
          Financial Results.   All amounts presented below are
before the impact of income taxes, except as noted.         
  Exelon s net income was $2,563 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $2,707 million for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2009, and diluted earnings per average common share were $3.87 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $4.09 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.   
        Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense,
which is a non-GAAP measure as discussed below, increased by $172 million primarily due to increased revenues of $201 million at Generation largely related to favorable capacity pricing in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. Exelon s results
were also affected by the impact of favorable weather conditions of $168 million in the ComEd and PECO service territories and a decrease in costs of $84 million associated with the Illinois Settlement Legislation, primarily at Generation. Further,
revenues at the utility companies increased by $92 million to recover the costs of regulatory required programs, which are offset in operating expenses, and ComEd recognized recovery of $59 million from customers associated with its uncollectible
accounts rider mechanism. Offsetting these favorable impacts were unfavorable market and portfolio conditions of $174 million, increased nuclear fuel costs of $115 million, a reduction of $95 million in mark-to-market gains from Generation s
hedging activities in 2010 compared to 2009 and a $57 million impairment of SO   2   
emissions allowances related to the U.S. EPA s proposed Transport Rule.   
         63

   Operating and maintenance expense decreased by $75 million primarily due to the impact of 2009
activities, including the $223 million impairment of the Handley and Mountain Creek stations in 2009 and reduced stock compensation costs in 2010 of $40 million across the operating companies. Decreased operating and maintenance expense was
partially offset by higher costs at the utility companies associated with regulatory required programs of $84 million, which are offset in revenue net of purchased power expense, a 2009 reduction in Generation s ARO of $51 million and
incremental costs of $42 million related to storms in the ComEd and PECO service territories.            Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $241 million primarily due to increased depreciation expense of $144 million related to ongoing capital expenditures and the change in estimated useful lives
associated with the plants subject to shutdowns announced in December 2009 and a scheduled increase in CTC amortization expense at PECO of $98 million in connection with the end of the transition period in accordance with its 1998 restructuring
settlement. Exelon s results were also significantly affected by $120 million in 2009 expenses related to debt extinguishment costs resulting from a 2009 debt refinancing, and by lower net NDT gains of $102 million in 2010 for Non-Regulatory
Agreement Units as a result of less favorable market performance.            Exelon results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were negatively affected by certain income tax-related matters. Exelon recorded a non-cash charge of $65 million (after tax) in 2010 and a non-cash
gain of $66 million (after tax) in 2009 for the remeasurement of income tax uncertainties. Exelon also recorded a $65 million (after tax) charge to income tax expense as a result of health care legislation passed in March 2010 that includes a
provision that reduces the deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefits for Federal income tax purposes.         
  For further detail regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, including explanation of the non-GAAP
measure revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense, see the discussions of Results of Operations by Segment below.         
    Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings.   Exelon s adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2010 were $2,689 million, or $4.06 per diluted share, compared with adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of $2,723 million, or $4.12 per diluted share, for the same period in 2009. In addition to net income, Exelon evaluates its
operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain
costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon s baseline operating performance
excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating
resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or
deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

Economic and Market Conditions              Exelon has exposure to various market and financial risks, including the risk of price fluctuations in the wholesale power markets. Wholesale power prices are a function of supply and demand, which in turn are
driven by factors such as (1) the price of fuels, in particular, the prices of natural gas and coal, which drive the wholesale market prices that Generation s nuclear power plants can command, (2) the rate of expansion of subsidized
low carbon generation such as wind energy in the markets in which Generation s output is sold, (3) the impacts on energy demand of factors such as weather, economic conditions and implementation of energy efficiency and demand response
programs, and (4) regulatory and legislative actions, such as the proposed U.S. EPA Transport Rule and the New Jersey capacity legislation. See  Environmental Matters  and  Regulatory and Legislative Matters  sections below for
further detail on the Transport Rule and New Jersey capacity legislation, respectively.            The use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is expected to increase natural gas supply and reserves, which will tend to place downward pressure on natural gas prices and therefore on
wholesale power prices, which would mean a reduction in Exelon s revenues.            The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity. Poorer than expected economic conditions, milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand
response programs can depress demand. The result is that higher-cost generating resources do not run as frequently, putting downward pressure on market prices for electricity and/or capacity. The continued sluggish economy in the United States has
in fact led to a slow down in the growth of demand for electricity, and ComEd and PECO are projecting load demand to remain flat in 2011 compared to 2010.         
    Hedging Strategy.   Exelon s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the
financial impact of market price volatility. Although Exelon s hedging policies have helped protect Exelon s earnings as wholesale market prices have declined, sustained increases in natural gas supply and reserve levels, or a slow
recovery of the economy, could result in a prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity prices and in long-term sluggish growth in demand.         
  Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into derivative
contracts including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. Generation has hedges in
place that significantly mitigate this risk for 2011 and 2012. However, Generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent years with respect to which a larger portion of its electricity portfolio is currently
unhedged. Generation currently hedges commodity risk on a ratable basis over the three years leading to the spot market. As of December 31, 2010, the percentage of   
         66   

Table of Contents  

expected generation hedged was 90%-93%, 67%-70% and 32%-35% for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by
the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include cash flow hedges,
other derivatives and certain non-derivative contracts including sales to ComEd and PECO to serve their retail load. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate this price risk in subsequent years as
well. The expiration of the PPA with PECO at the end of 2010 will likely result in increases in margins earned by Generation in 2011 for the portion of Generation s electricity portfolio previously sold to PECO under the PPA, however the
ultimate impact of entering into new power supply contracts under Generation s three-year ratable hedging program to replace the PPA will depend on a number of factors, including future wholesale market prices, capacity markets, energy demand
and the effects of any new applicable Pennsylvania laws and or rules and regulations promulgated by the PAPUC.         
  Generation procures coal and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained
predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel
services, coal and natural gas are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of
counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 57% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2011 through 2015 are supplied by three producers. In the event of non-performance
by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these
counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Generation uses long-term contracts and financial instruments such as over-the-counter and
exchange-traded instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures. Both ComEd and PECO mitigate exposure to commodity price risk through the recovery of procurement costs from retail customers.   
          New Growth Opportunities     
          Nuclear Uprate Program.   During 2009, Generation
announced a series of planned power uprates across its nuclear fleet that will result in between 1,300 and 1,500 MW of additional generation capacity within eight years. The uprate projects represent a total investment of approximately $3.65 billion
in overnight cost, as measured in 2010 dollars. Using proven technologies, the projects take advantage of new production and measurement technologies, new materials and learning from a half-century of nuclear power operations. Uprate projects,
representing approximately 60% of the planned uprate MW, are underway at the Limerick and Peach Bottom nuclear stations in Pennsylvania and the Byron, Braidwood, Dresden, LaSalle and Quad Cities plants in Illinois. The remainder will come from
additional projects across Generation s nuclear fleet beginning in 2011 and ending in 2017. At 1,500 nuclear-generated MW, the uprates would displace 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually that would otherwise come from burning
fossil fuels. The uprates are being undertaken pursuant to an organized, strategically sequenced implementation plan. The implementation effort includes a periodic review and refinement of the project in light of changing market conditions. As part
of this periodic review process, the uprate project at Three Mile Island is currently under evaluation. The amount of expenditures to implement the plan ultimately will depend on economic and policy developments, and will be made on a
project-by-project basis in accordance with Exelon s normal project evaluation standards. The ability to implement several projects requires the successful resolution of various technical issues. The resolution of these issues may affect the
timing and amount of the power   
         67

increases associated with the power uprate initiative. Through December 31, 2010, Generation had added 101 MWs of nuclear generation through its uprate program, with another 98 MWs scheduled
to be added in 2011.              Acquisition of John Deere
Renewables.   On December 9, 2010, Generation acquired all of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind), a leading operator and developer of wind power, for approximately $893 million in cash.
Generation acquired 735 MWs of installed, operating wind capacity located in eight states. Approximately 75% of the operating portfolio s expected output is already sold under long-term power purchase arrangements. Additionally, Generation will
pay up to $40 million related to three projects with a capacity of 230 MWs which are currently in advanced stages of development, contingent upon meeting certain contractual commitments related to the commencement of construction of each project.
This contingent consideration was valued at $32 million of which approximately $16 million has been recorded as a current liability and the remainder has been recorded as a noncurrent liability. As a result, total consideration recorded for the
Exelon Wind acquisition was $925 million. Generation also has the opportunity to pursue approximately 1,200 MWs of new wind projects that are in various stages of development. On September 30, 2010, Generation issued $900 million of senior
notes whose proceeds were used to fund the acquisition. The acquisition provides incremental earnings starting in 2012 and cash flows starting in 2013 and is a key part of Exelon 2020.              Transmission Development Project.   Exelon, Electric Transmission America, LLC (ETA) and AEP Transmission
Holding Company, LLC (AEP) have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to develop a 420-mile extra high-voltage transmission project from the Ohio border through Indiana to the northern portion of Illinois. The Reliability Interregional
Transmission Extension (RITE) Line project is expected to strengthen the high-voltage transmission system and improve overall system reliability. ComEd is expected to lead the building of the Illinois portion of the project. The total cost of the
RITE Line project is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, with the Illinois portion of the line expected to cost approximately $1.2 billion. These costs are expected to be funded by ComEd, Exelon or an affiliate, ETA and AEP. The ultimate cost
of the line will be dependent on a number of factors, including RTO requirements, state siting requirements, routing of the line, and equipment and commodity costs. The project will be built in stages over three to four years, likely between 2015
and 2018, and is subject to FERC, PJM and state approvals.         
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure.   On April 22, 2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan
under which PECO will deploy 600,000 smart meters within three years and deploy smart meters to all of its electric customers over the next 10 years. On April 12, 2010, PECO entered into a Financial Assistance Agreement with the DOE for SGIG
funds under the ARRA. Under the SGIG, PECO has been awarded $200 million, the maximum allowable grant under the program, for its SGIG project, Smart Future Greater Philadelphia. The SGIG project has a budget of more than $400 million and includes
approximately $7 million related to demonstration projects by two sub-recipients. In total, over the next ten years, PECO is planning to spend up to a total of $650 million on its smart grid and smart meter infrastructure. During 2010, PECO entered
into agreements for an AMI network, AMI systems, installation of the first 600,000 meters, and procurement of meters and fiber-cable. The $200 million SGIG from the DOE will be used to reduce the impact of these investments on PECO ratepayers. PECO
filed for PAPUC approval of an initial dynamic pricing and customer acceptance program under the Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan in October 2010, and plans to file for approval of a universal meter deployment plan for its remaining
customers in 2012.            In October 2009, the ICC approved
ComEd s proposed AMI pilot program, with minor modifications, and recovery of substantially all program costs from customers. The one-year program was operational in June 2010. The total anticipated cost of the pilot program is
approximately   
         68   

Table of Contents  

$69 million. The AMI pilot program allows ComEd to study the costs and benefits related to automated metering and to develop the cost estimate of potential full system-wide implementation of AMI.
In addition, the program allows customers the ability to manage energy use, improve energy efficiency and lower energy bills. Due to an adverse September 30, 2010 Illinois Appellate Court decision, ComEd faces certain cost recovery issues in
connection with the pilot program. See Regulatory and Legislative Matters below and Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on cost recovery issues related to ComEd s AMI pilot program.   
          Liquidity and Cost Management     
          Pension Plan Funding.   As a result of accelerated cash
benefits associated with the Tax Relief Act of 2010, Exelon contributed $2.1 billion to its pension plans in January 2011, representing all currently planned 2011 qualified pension contributions. Exelon s planned funding of these contributions
includes $500 million from cash from operations, $750 million from the tax benefits of making the pension contributions and $850 million with the accelerated cash tax benefits from the 100% bonus depreciation provision enacted as part of the Tax
Relief Act of 2010. Exelon expects the $2.1 billion contribution, along with other factors, will increase the pension funded status from 71% at December 31, 2010 to 89% at December 31, 2011, subject to actual 2011 asset returns and final
actuarial valuations. The $2.1 billion pension contribution will also decrease 2011 pension costs.              Financing Activities.   On January 18, 2011, ComEd issued $600 million of 1.625% First Mortgage Bonds due January 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the bonds were used as an interim source of
liquidity for the January 2011 contribution to Exelon-sponsored pension plans in which ComEd participates. ComEd anticipates receiving tax refunds as a result of both the pension contribution and the recent Federal tax legislation allowing for
accelerated depreciation deductions in 2011 and 2012. As a result, the immediate use of the net proceeds to fund the planned contribution will allow those future cash receipts to be available to fund capital investment and for general corporate
purposes.              Credit Facilities.   On
March 25, 2010, ComEd replaced its $952 million credit facility with a similar $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that extends to March 25, 2013. Although the covenants are largely the same as the prior facility, the new
facility has higher borrowing costs, reflecting current market pricing. See Note 10 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding those costs. Exelon s, Generation s, and PECO s
primary credit facilities largely extend through October 2012. These credit facilities currently provide sufficient liquidity to each of the Registrants. Upon maturity of these credit facilities, Exelon, Generation and PECO may not be able
to renew or replace these existing facilities at current terms or commitment levels from banks. Consequently, Exelon, Generation, and PECO may face increased costs for liquidity needs in 2011 and may choose to establish cost-effective alternative
liquidity sources as appropriate. Exelon anticipates refinancing these credit facilities, approximately $6.4 billion, in the first half of 2011.         
  On November 4, 2010, Generation entered into a supplemental credit facility, which provides for an aggregate commitment of up to $300 million.
The effectiveness and availability of the credit facility were subject to various conditions, which were satisfied on February 7, 2011. This facility will be primarily used to issue letters of credit. See Note 10 of the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this credit facility.             Cost Management.   Exelon is committed to operating its businesses responsibly and managing its operating and capital costs in a manner that serves its customers and produces value for its shareholders.
Exelon is also committed to an ongoing strategy to make itself more effective, efficient and innovative. Exelon is committed to maintaining a cost control focus and continues to analyze cost trends to identify future cost savings opportunities and
implement more planning and performance-measurement tools to allow it to better identify areas for sustainable productivity improvements and cost reductions across the Registrants.

     Environmental Matters     
        Exelon supports the promulgation of environmental
regulation by the U.S. EPA, including air, water and waste controls for electric generating units. See discussion below for further details. In addition, Exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation by the U.S Congress, which includes a
mandatory, economy-wide cap-and-trade program for GHG emissions that balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions. Several bills containing provisions for legislation of GHG
emissions were introduced in Congress during the 111   th    Congress, but none were
passed by both houses of Congress. In reaction to the U.S. EPA s proposed regulation of GHG emissions, various bills have been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would prohibit or impede the U.S. EPA s rulemaking efforts.
The timing of the consideration of such legislation is unknown.              Exelon 2020.   In 2008, Exelon expanded its commitment to GHG reduction with the announcement of a comprehensive business and environmental strategic plan, which details an enterprise-wide strategy and
a wide range of initiatives being pursued by Exelon to reduce, offset, or displace more than 15 million metric tons of GHG emissions per year by 2020 (from 2001 levels). Exelon has incorporated Exelon 2020 into its overall business plans, and
as further legislation and regulation imposing requirements on emissions of air pollutants are promulgated, its emissions reduction efforts will position Exelon to benefit from the long-term positive impact of the requirements on capacity and energy
prices while minimizing the impact of costs of compliance on Exelon s operations, cash flows or financial position.         
    Air.   On July 6, 2010, the U.S. EPA published its proposed Transport Rule, which is the first of a number of significant
regulations that the U.S. EPA expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. The air and waste regulations will have a disproportionate adverse impact on
fossil-fuel power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and will likely result in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. Due to its low carbon generation portfolio, Generation
will not be significantly directly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage for Generation relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil-fuel plants. Upon preliminary review, it is expected that
implementation of the proposed Transport Rule regulations will increase power prices over the long term, which would result in a net benefit to Generation s results of operations and cash flows. Exelon filed comments with the U.S. EPA in
support of the proposed Transport Rule on October 1, 2010. Extensive comments were filed by the public, both in support of and in opposition to the proposed Transport Rule. The U.S. EPA is reviewing the comments and is scheduled to issue a
final rule by the end of the year, to become effective in January 2012.            Beginning with the proposed Transport Rule, the air requirements are expected to be implemented through a series of increasingly stringent regulations relating to conventional air pollutants (e.g., NO   x   , SO   2    and particulate matter) as well as HAPs (e.g., acid gases, mercury and other heavy metals) The U.S. EPA has announced that it will
complete a review of NAAQS in the 2011   2012 timeframe for ozone (nitrogen oxide and volatile organic chemicals), particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead. This review could result in more stringent emissions limits on
fossil-fired electric generating stations. The U.S. EPA is also preparing a proposed rule for a new HAP standard for electric generating units, which is expected to be finalized in the 2011   2012 timeframe. The cumulative impact of these
regulations could be to require power plant operators to install wet flue gas desulfurization technology for SO   2    and selective catalytic reduction technology for NO   x   .            In the absence of
Federal legislation, the U.S. EPA is also moving forward with the regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, including permitting requirements under the PSD and Title V operating permit sections of the Clean Air Act for new and modified
stationary sources that became   
         70   

Table of Contents  

effective on January 2, 2011, and proposed GHG emissions limitations under the New Source Performance Standards scheduled for finalization in May 2012 pursuant to a litigation settlement.
             Water.   Following legal challenges to the
Phase II rule implementing Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, the rule has been withdrawn and remanded to the U.S. EPA for revisions consistent with the courts  decisions. In the interim, Generation has been complying with the
requirements of the state permitting agencies, which are administering the rule pursuant to their best professional judgment until a new final rule is issued by the U.S. EPA.   
        On January 7, 2010, the NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for
Oyster Creek that would have required, in the exercise of its best professional judgment, the installation of cooling towers as the best technology available within seven years after the effective date of the permit. On December 8, 2010, Exelon
announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. In reliance on that announcement, NJDEP determined that the existing measures at Oyster Creek represent the best technology available
for the facility s cooling water intake through the cessation of generation operations. See further discussion of the planned shutdown of Oyster Creek in the  Plant Retirements  section below.   
          Waste.   Under proposed U.S. EPA rules issued on
June 21, 2010, coal combustion waste (CCW) would be regulated for the first time under the RCRA. The U.S. EPA is considering several options, including classification of CCW either as a hazardous or non-hazardous waste. Under either option, the
U.S. EPA s intention is the ultimate elimination of surface impoundments as a waste treatment process. For plants affected by the proposed rules, this would result in significant capital expenditures and variable operating and maintenance
expenditures to convert to dry handling and disposal systems and installation of new waste water treatment facilities. Exelon anticipates that the only plants in which it has an ownership interest that would be affected by proposed rules would be
Keystone and Conemaugh. As a result, Exelon does not currently expect the adoption of the rules as proposed to have a significant impact on its future capital spending requirements and operating costs. The U.S. EPA has not announced a target date
for finalization of the CCW rules.            See Note 18 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to environmental matters, including the impact of environmental regulation.         
    Regulatory and Legislative Matters           
    Appeal of 2007 Illinois Electric Distribution Rate Case.   On September 30, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court (Court) issued a
decision in the appeals related to the ICC s order in ComEd s 2007 electric distribution rate case (2007 Rate Case). That decision ruled against ComEd on the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation and the recovery of costs
for an AMI/Customer Applications pilot program via a rider (Rider SMP). On November 18, 2010, the Court denied ComEd s petition for rehearing in connection with the September 30, 2010 ruling. On January 25, 2011, ComEd filed a
Petition for Leave to Appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. ComEd does not believe any of its other riders are affected by the Court s ruling. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to
the Court s order.            The following table presents the
impacts to Exelon s and ComEd s actual 2010 and estimated 2011 pre-tax earnings resulting from the Court s order.         
 
         71

(a)  
  ComEd currently expects new rates will be established in its 2010 distribution rate case no later than June 2011, at which point in time the impacts of the Court s decision
should be fully incorporated into ComEd s rates.     

(b)  
  The Court also required the ICC to consider whether an additional three months of net pro forma plant investment, beyond what was approved in the ICC order, should be included in
rate base. To the extent the ICC allows ComEd to include an additional three months of net plant additions in its revised rates, the pre-tax revenues subject to refund would be reduced by an estimated $12 million in total through the first five
months of 2011.                2010 Illinois Electric
Distribution Rate Case.   On June 30, 2010, ComEd requested ICC approval for an increase of $396 million to its annual delivery services revenue requirement (2010 Rate Case). On January 3, 2011, ComEd filed surrebuttal testimony
which adjusted ComEd s requested increase to $326 million to account for recent changes in tax law, corrections, acceptance of limited adjustments proposed by certain parties and the amounts expected to be recovered in the AMI pilot program
tariff. The request to increase the annual revenue requirement is to allow ComEd to continue modernizing its electric delivery system and recover the costs of substantial investments made since the last rate filing in 2007. The requested increase
also reflects increased costs, most notably pension and OPEB, since ComEd s rates were last determined. The requested increase in electric distribution rates would increase the average residential customer s monthly electric bill by
approximately 5%. In addition, ComEd is requesting future recovery of certain amounts that were previously recorded as expense. If that request is approved, ComEd would reverse the previously expensed costs and establish regulatory assets with
amortization over the period during which rate recovery is allowed. As a result, ComEd would recognize a one-time benefit of up to $39 million (pre-tax) to reverse the prior charges. The requested increase also includes $22 million for increased
uncollectible accounts expense. If the rate request is approved, the threshold for determining over/under recoveries under ComEd s uncollectible accounts tariff would be increased by $22 million.   
        The Court s September 30, 2010 ruling in connection with the
2007 Rate Case makes it highly unlikely that the ICC would decide the post-test year accumulated depreciation issue in ComEd s favor in the 2010 Rate Case. ComEd estimates that its requested revenue requirement increase of $326 million could be
reduced by approximately $85 million as a result of this adjustment. Certain parties have submitted testimony recommending significant reductions to ComEd s requested increase as well as the write-off of certain assets, most notably the
regulatory assets associated with severance costs, which was approximately $74 million as of December 31, 2010. Management believes the regulatory asset is appropriate based on the ICC s orders in ComEd s last two distribution rate
cases. The new electric distribution rates are expected to take effect no later than June 2011. ComEd cannot predict how much of the requested electric distribution rate increase the ICC may approve. See the discussion of ComEd s 2007 Rate Case
above and in Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.            Subsequent to the Court s ruling, ComEd filed a request with the ICC to allow it to request recovery, through inclusion in the 2010 Rate Case, of $3 million in operation and maintenance costs, as well as
carrying costs associated with capital investment in the ICC-approved AMI/Customer Applications pilot program. The AMI pilot program capital investment had already been requested in rate base in the 2010 Rate Case. On December 2, 2010, the ICC
approved ComEd s request. The investment and the pilot program costs are subject to challenge in the 2010 Rate Case proceeding.         
    ComEd Alternative Regulation Pilot Program.     On August 31, 2010, ComEd filed with the ICC an alternative regulation pilot
proposal as a companion proposal to its 2010 Rate Case under a provision of the Illinois Public Utility Act that contemplates an alternative regulatory structure. Rather than employing the traditional rate setting process in which the utility seeks
recovery of costs already incurred, the proposal, if approved, would bring utilities, stakeholders, and the ICC together to develop, review and approve ongoing investment programs before those investments are made. The pilot
  
         72   

Table of Contents  

process would include a flow-through mechanism to recover the depreciation and the carrying costs associated with an estimated $130 million in capital investments and $65 million in incremental
operating and maintenance expense over a two-year period, as incurred. The unrecovered portion of the capital investments would be included in ComEd s rate base in its future delivery services rate case filing. The alternative regulatory
structure as proposed by ComEd includes an immediate operating and maintenance savings to customers (up to $2 million) and an incentive mechanism for completing the capital investments under budget. This filing includes a request for approval of the
alternative regulatory mechanism as well as approval of costs related to electric vehicles, accelerated reinvestment of urban underground facilities and low income assistance. If the mechanism is approved, ComEd would also seek recovery of an
estimated $125 million of smart grid investments after the conclusion of the Illinois Statewide Smart Grid Collaborative workshops, the smart grid policy docket and the evaluation of its AMI pilot program. The ICC is scheduled to issue an order by
May 28, 2011.              Proposed Legislation to Modernize
Electric Utility Infrastructure and to Update Illinois Ratemaking Process.   ComEd and other Illinois utilities and legislators are working to develop legislation that would modernize Illinois  electric grid. The proposal includes a
policy-based approach which would provide a more predictable ratemaking system and would enable utilities to modernize the electric grid and set the stage for fostering economic development while creating and retaining jobs. Many other states are
changing or are considering changes to the way they regulate utilities in order to improve the predictability of the ratemaking process.         
  The proposed legislation, which was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly on February 8, 2011, includes a process for determining formula
rates that would provide for the recovery of actual costs of service that are prudently incurred and reasonable in amount, reflect the utility s actual capital structure (excluding goodwill), and include a formula for calculating the return on
equity component of the cost of capital. The proposed legislation would apply to electric and gas utilities in Illinois on an opt-in basis and would not have any effect on the IPA process for energy procurement.   
        If the proposed legislation were to be enacted, ComEd would anticipate
adopting a formula rate and investing an additional $2.6 billion in capital expenditures over the next ten years to modernize its system and implement smart grid technology, including improvements to cyber security. These investments would be
incremental to ComEd s otherwise planned capital expenditures. However, there can be no assurances that the proposed legislation will be enacted into law.         
    2011 Pennsylvania Electric and Natural Gas Rates.   On December 16, 2010, the PAPUC approved the settlement of PECO s electric
distribution rate case for an increase of $225 million in annual service revenue, which is approximately 71% of the $316 million originally requested. The natural gas distribution rate case settlement reflects an increase of approximately $20
million in annual service revenue, which is approximately 46% of the $44 million originally requested. The approved electric and natural gas distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2011.   
        In accordance with the DSP Program, PECO has completed four competitive
procurements for electric supply for default electric service customers commencing January 2011. As of December 31, 2010, PECO had procured substantially all of the total estimated electric supply needed to serve the residential customer class
in 2011.            The approved electric distribution rate case
settlement and the 2010 electric supply procurement results indicate an increase of 5.1% in the average residential customer total electric bill on January 1, 2011, above 2010 bills.            The approved natural gas distribution rate case settlement and the estimated 2011 PGC costs will result in an increase of
1% in the average residential customer total natural gas bill on January 1, 2011, above 2010 bills.

PECO s rate case and procurement proceedings.         
    Financial Reform Legislation.   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted into law on July 21,
2010. This financial reform legislation includes a provision that requires over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared. The legislation provides an exemption from mandatory clearing requirements
for transactions that are used to hedge commercial risk like those utilized by Generation. At the same time, the legislation includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements for
transactions, including those that are used to hedge commercial risk. However, during drafting of the legislation, members of Congress issued a public letter stating that it was not their intention to impose margin and collateral requirements on
counterparties that utilize transactions to hedge commercial risk. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation, including new margin requirements, will be established through rulemakings and will not take effect until 12 months after the date
of enactment. If deemed a swap dealer, Generation would be required to execute over-the-counter derivative transactions, except those with qualifying end-users that are used to hedge commercial risk, through an exchange or central clearinghouse
subject to margin requirements; conversely, if deemed a qualifying end-user, Generation could elect not to clear such transactions. Although we believe a swap dealer designation is unlikely, a substantial shift from over-the-counter sales to
exchange cleared sales is estimated to require approximately $1 billion of additional collateral. Generation has adequate credit facilities and flexibility in its hedging program to accommodate these legislative or market changes. Generation
continues to monitor the rulemaking procedures and cannot predict the ultimate outcome that the financial reform legislation will have on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   
          New Jersey Capacity Legislation.   New Jersey Senate Bill
2381 was enacted into law on January 28, 2011. This legislation establishes a long-term capacity pilot program under which the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities will administer an RFP process to solicit offers for capacity agreements with
mid-merit and/or baseload generation constructed after the effective date of the bill. The pilot program seeks capacity agreements for a term of up to 15 years for 2,000 MW. The selected generators are required to bid in and clear the PJM RPM
auction, likely causing them to bid in at zero. Generators are paid based on the RFP contract price; therefore any difference between the RPM clearing price and the RFP contract price is either ultimately recovered from or refunded to New Jersey
electric customers. This state required customer subsidy for generation capacity is expected to artificially suppress capacity prices within the Mid-Atlantic region, which could adversely affect Generation s results of operations and cash
flows. Other states could seek to establish similar programs, which could substantially impair Exelon s market driven position.         
  PJM s capacity market rules include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) that is intended to preclude sellers from artificially suppressing the
competitive price signals for generation capacity. On February 1, 2011, PJM Power Providers Group, of which Generation is a member, filed a complaint asking FERC to revise PJM s MOPR to mitigate this exercise of buyer market power.
Generation expects PJM to make a similar filing at FERC. In addition, on February 9, 2011, Generation and others filed a complaint in Federal district court requesting that the court declare the statute unconstitutional and that it enjoin
implementation of the statute.              Illinois State Income
Tax Legislation.     The Taxpayer Accountability and Budget Stabilization Act, (Senate Bill 2505), enacted into law in Illinois on January 13, 2011, increases the corporate tax rate in Illinois from 7.3% to 9.5% for tax years 2011
  2014, provides for a reduction in the rate from 9.5% to 7.75% for tax years 2015   2024 and further reduces the rate from 7.75% to 7.3% for tax years 2025 and thereafter.            The rate change from 7.3% to 9.5% will result in a one-time charge or credit to deferred taxes as the balances must be
recalculated at the new corporate tax rates. The Registrants are unable to   
         74   

Table of Contents  

estimate the impact at this time. Additionally, the rate change will increase Exelon s future Illinois state income taxes, net of offsetting Federal benefit, by approximately $25 million in
2011, of which $10 million and $10 million relate to Generation and ComEd, respectively.              Plant Retirements                Oyster Creek.   On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. The current NRC license for Oyster
Creek expires in 2029. In reliance upon Exelon s determination to cease generation operations at Oyster Creek no later than December 31, 2019, the NJDEP has determined that closed cycle cooling is not the best technology available for
Oyster Creek given the length of time that would be required to retrofit from the existing once-through cooling system to a closed-cycle cooling system and the limited life span of Oyster Creek after installation of a closed-cycle cooling system.
Based on its consideration of these and other factors, in its best professional judgment, NJDEP has determined that the existing measures at Oyster Creek represent the best technology available for the facility s cooling water intake through
cessation of generation operations. As a result of the announcement to close Oyster Creek by 2019, Generation s operating expenses increased by $7 million (pre-tax) in 2010 and are estimated to increase approximately $25-$30 million (pre-tax)
in each of the years 2011 through 2015. The impacts to Generation s operating expenses in years 2016 through 2019 will be dependent on future capital spending at Oyster Creek. Generation will also make employee retention payments of
approximately $20 million in 2011 that are expected to increase operating expenses by approximately $4 million (pre-tax) in each of the years 2011 through 2015.         
    Eddystone and Cromby.   In 2009, Exelon announced its intention to permanently retire three coal-fired generating units and one
oil/gas-fired generating unit effective May 31, 2011 in response to the economic outlook related to the continued operation of these four units. The units to be retired are Cromby Generating Station (Cromby) Unit 1 and Unit 2 and Eddystone
Generating Station (Eddystone) Unit 1 and Unit 2. PJM determined that transmission reliability upgrades will be necessary to alleviate reliability impacts and that those upgrades will be completed in a manner that will permit Generation s
retirement of the units on the following schedule: Cromby Unit 1 and Eddystone Unit 1 on May 31, 2011; Cromby Unit 2 on December 31, 2011; and Eddystone Unit 2 on June 1, 2012. As a result, on December 14, 2010, Generation
reached a proposed settlement with FERC Staff and other intervenors regarding the terms of the reliability-must-run rate schedule, subject to FERC approval, for Cromby Unit 2 and Eddystone Unit 2. Under the proposed settlement, monthly fixed-cost
recovery during the reliability-must-run period for Cromby Unit 2 and Eddystone Unit 2 would be approximately $2 million and $6 million, respectively. In addition, Generation would be reimbursed for variable costs including fuel, emissions costs,
chemicals, auxiliary power and for project investment costs during the reliability-must-run period.               Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates          
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and
assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with its Accounting and Disclosure Governance Committee on a
regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committees of the Exelon, ComEd and PECO Boards of Directors. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of
accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)    
        Generation must make significant estimates and assumptions in
accounting for its obligation to decommission its nuclear generating plants in accordance with the authoritative guidance for AROs.         
  The authoritative guidance requires that Generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. To
estimate that liability, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model that considers multiple outcome scenarios based upon significant estimates and assumptions embedded in the following:   
          Decommissioning Cost Studies.   Generation uses
unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the costs and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within its industry and other estimates.
Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years.         
    Cost Escalation Studies.   Generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost
studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors; and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and
materials, energy, LLRW disposal and other costs.         
    Probabilistic Cash Flow Models.   Generation s probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various
scenarios for decommissioning costs, approaches and timing on a unit-by-unit basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) then the base
cost scenario. Probabilities assigned alternative decommissioning approaches assess the likelihood of performing DECON (a method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment, structures, and portions of a
facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed and safely buried in a LLRW landfill or decontaminated to a level that permits property to be released for unrestricted use), Delayed DECON (similar to the DECON scenario but with a
delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activities) or SAFSTOR (a method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be
safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use generally within 60 years after cessation of operations) procedures. Probabilities assigned to the timing scenarios incorporate the likelihood of
continued operation through current license lives or through anticipated license renewals. Generation s probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal, which Generation currently
assumes will begin in 2020, based on the DOE s most recent indication. For more information regarding the estimated date that DOE will begin accepting SNF, see Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
          License Renewals.   Generation assumes a successful 20-year
renewal for each of its nuclear generating station licenses, except for Oyster Creek, in determining its nuclear decommissioning ARO. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Oyster Creek.
Generation has successfully secured 20-year operating license renewal extensions for eight of its nuclear units, and none of Generation s applications for an operating license extension has been denied. Generation is in various stages of the
process of pursuing similar extensions on its remaining eleven operating nuclear units (including the two Salem units co-owned by Generation, but operated by PSEG). Generation s assumption regarding license extension for ARO determination
purposes is based in part on the good current physical condition and high performance of these nuclear units; the favorable status of the ongoing license renewal proceedings with the NRC, and the successful renewals for eight units to date.
Generation estimates that the failure to obtain license   
         76   

Table of Contents  

renewals at any of these nuclear units (assuming all other assumptions remain constant) would increase its ARO on average approximately $190 million per unit as of December 31, 2010. The
size of the increase to the ARO for a particular nuclear unit is dependent upon the current stage in its original license term and its specific decommissioning cost estimates. If Generation does not receive license renewal on a particular unit, the
increase to the ARO may be mitigated by Generation s ability to delay ultimate decommissioning activities under a SAFSTOR method of decommissioning.         
    Discount Rates.   The probability-weighted estimated future cash flows using these various scenarios are discounted using
credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. Changes in the CARFR could result in significant changes in the ARO. If Generation used a 2009 CARFR instead of the
2010 CARFR in performing its third quarter ARO update, it would have resulted in a $180 million decrease in the ARO. Additionally, if the CARFR used in performing the third quarter 2010 ARO update was increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the
ARO would have decreased $60 million or increased $90 million, respectively.            Changes in the assumptions underlying the foregoing items could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The following table illustrates the effects of changing certain ARO assumptions, discussed above,
while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

                If the estimated date for DOE acceptance of SNF were to be extended to 2030, Generation s aggregate nuclear decommissioning obligation would be reduced by an immaterial amount.   
        Under the authoritative guidance, the nuclear decommissioning
obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants. For more
information regarding accounting for nuclear decommissioning obligations, see Notes 1 and 12 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         
   Goodwill (Exelon and ComEd)          
  ComEd has goodwill relating to the acquisition of ComEd in 2000 as part of the PECO/Unicom Merger. Under the provisions of the authoritative
guidance for goodwill, ComEd is required to perform an assessment for impairment of its goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs, such as a significant negative regulatory outcome, or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of the ComEd reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or operating component and is the level at which goodwill is tested for
impairment. The impairment assessment is performed using a two-step, fair value based test. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets   
         77   

Table of Contents  

and liabilities using purchase price allocation guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an
impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the
reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector
market performance and transactions, operating and capital expenditure requirements and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step (if needed), management would need to estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the
reporting unit.            ComEd did not recognize an impairment in
2010; however, adverse regulatory actions that could reduce ComEd s allowed long-term rate of return on common equity or a fully successful IRS challenge to Exelon s and ComEd s like-kind exchange income tax position in combination
with changes in significant assumptions described above could potentially result in a future impairment loss of ComEd s goodwill, which could be material. If any combination of changes to significant assumptions resulted in a 5% reduction in
fair value as of November 1, 2010, ComEd still would have passed the first step of the goodwill assessment. See Notes 2 and 7 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Purchase Accounting (Exelon and Generation)    
            Determining the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions used in valuing Generation s acquisition of John
Deere Renewables on December 9, 2010 include: projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future market prices. There are also judgments made to determine the
expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Generation did not record any goodwill related to the acquisition of John Deere Renewables.   
         Impairment of Long-lived Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO evaluate their long-lived assets,
excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating
business climate, including current energy and market conditions, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The review of long-lived assets
for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. For the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires
assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power, costs of fuel and the expected operations of assets. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and, thus,
could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other
groups of assets and liabilities. For the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to
those units. For ComEd and PECO, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by evaluation of several factors including the ratemaking jurisdiction in which they operate and the type of service or commodity provided. For ComEd, the
lowest level of independent cash flows is transmission and distribution and for PECO, the lowest level   
         78   

Table of Contents  

of independent cash flows is transmission, distribution and gas. Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the
undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair
value. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. Additionally, some assumptions or
projections inevitably will not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur during the forecast period. These could include, among others, major changes in the economic environment; significant increases or decreases in current
mortgage interest rates and/or terms or availability of financing altogether; property assessment; and/or major revisions in current state and/or Federal tax or regulatory laws. Therefore, the actual results achieved during the projected holding
period and investor requirements relative to anticipated annual returns and overall yields could vary from the projection. Accordingly, to the extent that any of the information used in the fair value analysis requires adjustment, the resulting fair
market value would be different. As such, the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources. An impairment determination would require the affected
Registrant to reduce both the long-lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment.         
  Exelon holds certain investments in coal-fired plants in Georgia and Texas subject to long-term leases. Exelon determines the investment in these
plants by incorporating an estimate of the residual values of the leased assets. On an annual basis, Exelon reviews the estimated residual values of these plants to determine if the current estimate of their residual value is lower than the one used
at the start of the lease. In determining the estimate of the residual value the expectation of future market conditions, including commodity prices, is considered. If the estimated residual value is lower than at the start of the lease and the
decline is considered to be other than temporary, a loss will be recognized with a corresponding reduction to the carrying amount of the investment. To date, no such losses have been recognized.

   Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The Registrants have significant investments in electric generation
assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. Depreciation of these assets is generally provided over their estimated service lives on a straight-line basis using the composite method. The estimation of service lives
requires management judgment regarding the period of time that the assets will be in use. As circumstances warrant, the estimated service lives are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed. Depreciation rates incorporate assumptions on
interim retirements based on actual historical retirement experience. To the extent interim retirement patterns change, this could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. Changes to
depreciation estimates resulting from a change in the estimated end of service lives could have a significant impact on the amount of depreciation expense recorded in the income statement. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant and equipment of the Registrants.         
  The estimated service lives of the nuclear generating facilities are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year
license renewal extension of the operating licenses for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding Oyster
Creek. While Generation has received license renewals for certain facilities, and has applied for or expects to apply   
         79   

Table of Contents  

for and obtain approval of license renewals for the remaining facilities, circumstances may arise that would prevent Generation from obtaining additional license renewals. Generation also
periodically evaluates the estimated service lives of its fossil fuel generating facilities based on feasibility assessments as well as economic and capital requirements. The estimated service lives of the hydroelectric generating facilities are
based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of the operating licenses. A change in depreciation estimates resulting from Generation s extension or reduction of the estimated service lives could
have a significant effect on Generation s results of operations. Generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2010, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2010.
           ComEd is required to file a depreciation rate study at
least every five years with the ICC. ComEd filed a depreciation rate study with the ICC in January 2009, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2009.   
        PECO is required to file a depreciation rate study at least every five
years with the PAPUC. In April 2010, PECO filed a depreciation rate study with the PAPUC for both its electric and gas assets, which resulted in the implementation of new depreciation rates effective January 2011.   
         Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd
and PECO)             Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension
plans and postretirement benefit plans for substantially all Generation, ComEd, PECO, and Exelon Corporate employees. See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the
defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.            The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit and other postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation
assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions
including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan
participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans and the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs,
among other factors. The assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is generally recognized over the expected
average remaining service period of the employees rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. Pension and postretirement benefit costs attributed to the operating companies are labor costs and are ultimately allocated to projects
within the operating companies, some of which are capitalized.            Pension and postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real
estate, private equity and hedge funds. See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement plan assets, including valuation techniques and
classification in accordance with authoritative guidance under the fair value hierarchy.              Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets.   The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption used in calculating pension costs was 8.50%, 8.50% and 8.75% for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
  
         80   

Table of Contents  

respectively. The weighted average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 7.83%, 8.10% and 7.80% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The pension trust
activity is non-taxable, while other postretirement benefit trust activity is partially taxable. The EROA is based on asset allocations at year end. In 2010, Exelon modified its pension investment strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its
pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. As a result of this modification, over time, Exelon plans to decrease equity investments and increase investments in fixed income securities and alternative investments in order to achieve a
balanced portfolio of risk-reducing and return-seeking assets. The change in the overall investment strategy will likely lower the expected rate of return on plan assets in future years as compared to the previous strategy. See Note 13 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon s asset allocations. Exelon used an EROA of 8.00% and 7.08% to estimate its 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively. For
2012, Exelon projects an EROA of 7.50% and 7.08% for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.         
      Exelon calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of
plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of
either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the
difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For other postretirement benefit
plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.            Actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The actual asset returns across the Registrant s pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 11.9% and 11.6%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of 8.50% and 7.83%, respectively. Those return levels are expected to decrease 2011 and
2012 benefit costs as follows:         
          This information assumes that movements in asset returns occur absent changes to other actuarial assumptions, and does not consider any actions management may take, such as changes to the amount and timing of
future contributions. The actuarial assumptions used in the determination of pension and postretirement benefit costs are interrelated and changes in other assumptions could have the impact of offsetting all or a portion of the potential decrease in
benefit costs set forth above.              Discount Rate.
  The discount rates used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2010 were 5.26% and 5.30%, respectively, and the discount rates for determining both the pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 5.83% and 6.09%, respectively. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate was determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of
high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated distributions under the pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.   
         81   

Table of Contents  

   The discount rate assumptions used to determine the obligation at year end are used to determine the
cost for the following year. Exelon will use discount rates of 5.26% and 5.30% to estimate its 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively.   
          Health Care Reform Legislation.   In March 2010, the Health
Care Reform Acts were signed into law, which contain a number of provisions that impact retiree health care plans provided by employers. In particular, the Health Care Reform Acts include a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost
plans beginning in 2018, whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate. Although the excise tax does not go into effect until 2018, accounting guidance requires Exelon to incorporate the estimated impact of the excise
tax in its annual actuarial valuation. The application of the legislation is still unclear and Exelon continues to monitor the Department of Labor and IRS for additional guidance. Certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the
excise tax on Exelon s other postretirement obligation, including projected inflation rates (based on the CPI) and whether pre- and post-65 retiree populations can be aggregated in determining the premium values of health care benefits. Exelon
reflected its best estimate of the expected impact in its annual actuarial valuation, which increased its postretirement benefit obligation by $145 million as of December 31, 2010 and increases annual other postretirement benefit costs by
approximately $32 million, beginning in 2011.            The excise
tax is applied to the value of retiree health care benefits in excess of certain thresholds, which increase each year based on the rate of CPI. Therefore, the assumed rate of CPI impacts the extent to which Exelon s future retiree health care
benefit premiums exceed the thresholds. Exelon assumed an annual CPI of 2.5% in calculating the impact of the excise tax on Exelon s other postretirement obligation as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, a 50 basis point
decrease in the assumed CPI (holding all other assumptions constant) would have increased Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $70 million, and a 50 basis point increase in the assumed CPI would have decreased
Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $65 million.            The impact of the excise tax is also dependent on whether pre- and post-65 retirees can be aggregated for purposes of calculating the value of health care benefits provided by Exelon. The value of the health care
benefits provided to pre-65 employees is greater than the value for post-65 employees because pre-65 employees are not eligible for Medicare. The aggregation of pre- and post-65 retiree populations reduces the average value of the health care
benefits and, therefore, results in less excise tax. Exelon has assumed pre- and post-65 retirees will be allowed to be aggregated for purposes of calculating the impact of the excise tax on its other postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2010. The disaggregation of pre- and post-65 retiree populations would have increased Exelon s other postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $200 million (holding all other assumptions constant) as of
December 31, 2010.              Health Care Cost Trend Rate.
  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the costs reported for Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans. Accounting guidance requires that annual health care cost estimates be developed using past and
present health care cost trends (both for Exelon and across the broader economy), as well as expectations of health care cost escalation, changes in health care utilization and delivery patterns, technological advances and changes in the health
status of plan participants. Therefore, the trend rate assumption is subject to significant uncertainty, particularly when considering potential impacts of the 2010 Health Care Reform Acts. Exelon assumed a health care cost trend rate of 7.00% at
December 31, 2010, decreasing to an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5.00% in 2015.   
         82

     Sensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions:   The following tables illustrate the effects
of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):         

(a)  
  In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the
discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate.           
    Average Remaining Service Period.   For pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial
gains and losses, as applicable, based on participants  average remaining service periods. The average remaining service period of defined benefit pension plan participants was 12.4 years, 12.7 years and 12.8 years for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.            For
other postretirement benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized estimated prior service costs over participants  average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes its transition obligations and certain actuarial gains
and losses over participants  average remaining service period to expected retirement. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to benefit eligibility age was 6.8 years, 6.8 years and 6.9 years
for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The average remaining service period of postretirement benefit plan participants related to expected retirement was 9.0 years, 9.2 years and 9.4 years for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Table of Contents  

    Regulatory Accounting (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)             Exelon, ComEd and PECO account for their regulated electric and gas operations in accordance with the authoritative
guidance for accounting for certain types of regulations, which requires Exelon, ComEd, and PECO to reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements. Use of this guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet
the following criteria: (1) third-party regulation of rates; (2) cost-based rates; and (3) a reasonable expectation that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have
been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts
will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. As of December 31, 2010, Exelon, ComEd and PECO have concluded that the operations of ComEd and PECO
meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of those operations no longer meets the criteria of this guidance, Exelon, ComEd and PECO would be required to eliminate any associated
regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and could be material. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of Exelon, ComEd and PECO.         
  For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, Exelon, ComEd and PECO assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities
continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political
environments, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in ComEd and PECO s jurisdictions, and recent rate orders. Furthermore, Exelon, ComEd and PECO make other judgments related to the financial statement impact of their regulatory
environments, such as the types of adjustments to rate base that will be acceptable to regulatory bodies and the types of costs and the extent, if any, to which those costs will be recoverable through rates. Additionally, estimates are made in
accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies, as to the amount of revenues billed under certain regulatory orders that may ultimately be refunded to customers upon finalization of applicable regulatory or judicial processes. These
assessments are based, to the extent possible, on past relevant experience with regulatory bodies in ComEd and PECO s jurisdictions, known circumstances specific to a particular matter and hearings held with the applicable regulatory body. If
the assessments and estimates made by Exelon, ComEd and PECO are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact on their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be material.   
         Accounting for Derivative Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)
            The Registrants utilize derivative instruments to
manage their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, changes in interest rates related to planned future debt issuances and changes in the fair value of outstanding debt. Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to
manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. Additionally, Generation enters into energy-related derivatives for
proprietary trading purposes. ComEd has entered into contracts to procure energy, capacity and ancillary services. In addition, ComEd has a financial swap contract with Generation that extends into 2013 and floating-to-fixed energy swaps with
several unaffiliated suppliers that extend into 2032. PECO has entered into derivative natural gas contracts to hedge its long-term price risk in the natural gas market. As part of the preparation for the expiration of the PPA with Generation at the
end of 2010, PECO has entered into derivative contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive RFP process as outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Program. ComEd and PECO do not enter into derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. The
Registrants  derivative   
         84   

Table of Contents  

activities are in accordance with Exelon s Risk Management Policy (RMP). See Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
Registrants  derivative instruments.            The Registrants
account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. Determining whether or not a contract qualifies as a derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing
the market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts. Further, interpretive guidance related to the authoritative literature continues to evolve, including how it applies to
energy and energy-related products. Changes in management s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance related to derivatives, could result in previously excluded contracts being subject to
the provisions of the authoritative derivative guidance. Generation has determined that contracts to purchase uranium and contracts to purchase and sell RECs do not meet the definition of a derivative under the current authoritative guidance since
they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium or REC markets are sufficiently liquid to conclude that forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. If the uranium or REC markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and
Generation begins to account for uranium purchase contracts or REC purchase and sale contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with Generation s other derivative instruments. In
this case, if market prices differ from the underlying prices of the contracts, Generation would be required to record a mark-to-market gain or loss, which may have a material impact to Exelon s and Generation s financial positions and
results of operations.            Under current authoritative
guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for a normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as fair
value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is
effective in offsetting the change in the hedged cash flows of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any
hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For other derivative contracts that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting and for energy-related derivatives entered for proprietary trading purposes, changes in the fair value of the
derivatives are recognized in earnings each period except for ComEd and PECO, in which changes in the fair value each period are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.   
          Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception.   Determining
whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires that management exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated
qualification and documentation requirements. Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. Contracts which qualify for the normal purchases
and normal sales exception are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and price is not tied to an unrelated underlying derivative.
As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and
energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, the transactions have been
designated as normal purchases and normal sales and are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with Generation and other suppliers as part of the
initial ComEd procurement auction and the   
         85   

Table of Contents  

subsequent RFP process, PECO s full requirement contracts and block contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP program and all of PECO s natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives
qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. If it were determined that a transaction designated as a normal purchase or a normal sale no longer met the scope exceptions, the fair value of the related contract would be recorded on
the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings at Generation or offset by a regulatory asset or liability at ComEd and PECO. Thereafter, future changes in fair value would be recorded in the balance sheet and recognized through
earnings at Generation. Triggering events that could result in a contract s loss of the normal purchase and normal sale designation, because it is no longer probable that the contract will result in physical delivery, include changes in
business requirements, changes in counterparty credit and financial rather than physical contract settlements (book-outs).         
    Commodity Contracts.   Identification of a commodity contract as a qualifying cash flow hedge requires Generation to determine that the
contract is in accordance with the RMP, the forecasted future transaction is probable and the hedging relationship between the commodity contract and the expected future purchase or sale of the commodity is expected to be highly effective at the
initiation of the hedge and throughout the hedging relationship. Internal models that measure the statistical correlation between the derivative and the associated hedged item determine the effectiveness of such a commodity contract designated as a
hedge. Generation reassesses its cash flow hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be effective and whether the forecasted future transactions remain probable. When a contract does not meet the effective or probable criteria of
the authoritative guidance, hedge accounting is discontinued and changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded through earnings at Generation or offset by a regulatory asset or liability at ComEd and PECO.   
        As a part of accounting for derivatives, the Registrants make estimates
and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not
to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the Registrants categorize these derivatives under a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain non-exchange-based derivatives valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges are categorized
in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to
ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The
Registrant s non-exchange-based derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. The remainder of non-exchange-based derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black
model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For non-exchange-based derivatives
that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, Black model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited
pricing information, such as the financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd, Black model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to
the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration.   
         86   

Table of Contents  

Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the Black model inputs generally are not observable. The Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of
derivative contracts categorized in Level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. The impacts of credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been
material to the financial statements.              Interest Rate
Derivative Instruments.   The Registrants may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt.
Additionally, the Registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to lock in interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings. The Registrants use a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future
outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as interest rates and
volatility. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.   
        See ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk and Notes 8 and 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants  derivative instruments.   
         Taxation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Significant management judgment is required in determining the
Registrants  provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the
Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being ultimately realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions
that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position,
assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of
unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants  consolidated financial statements.         
  The Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the
availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits
have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the Registrants conclude it is more likely than not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.   
        Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future
impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Registrants  forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations
of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While the Registrants believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome
of tax matters could result in favorable or   
         87   

Table of Contents  

unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding taxes.             Accounting for Contingencies (Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO)             In the preparation of
their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable based upon available information. The amounts recorded may
differ from the actual income or expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. The estimates that the Registrants make in accounting for contingencies and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties
could have a significant effect on their consolidated financial statements.              Environmental Costs.   Environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and
cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work, changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Annual studies are
conducted to determine the future remediation requirements and estimates are adjusted accordingly. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material effect on the Registrants  results of operations,
financial position and cash flows. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
    Other, Including Personal Injury Claims.   The Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, and personal
injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR
reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties
surrounding litigation and possible legislative measures in the United States, could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material
effect on the Registrants  results of operations, financial position and cash flows.             Revenue Recognition (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. The determination of Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s retail energy sales to
individual customers, however, is based on systematic readings of customer meters generally on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and
corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to
customers and applicable customer rates. Increases in volumes delivered to the utilities  customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled
revenue. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain
materially unchanged.            The determination of
Generation s energy sales, excluding the retail business, is based on estimated amounts delivered as well as fixed quantity sales. At the end of each month, amounts of   
         88

energy delivered to customers during the month are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Increases in volumes delivered to the wholesale customers in the period, as well
as price, would increase unbilled revenue.             Allowance for Uncollectible
Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             The
allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable agings, historical experience and other currently
available information. ComEd and PECO estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying internally developed loss rates to the outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of
customers with similar credit quality indicators that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average
charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. ComEd and PECO customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a
monthly basis. ComEd and PECO customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. ComEd s and PECO s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and
economic conditions as well as changes in ICC and PAPUC regulations, respectively. See Note 4 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding accounts receivable.

         Results of Operations Generation    

(a)  
  Generation evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation believes that revenue net of purchased power and
fuel expense is a useful measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to
other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

Table of Contents  

     Net Income           
       Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009.      Generation s 2010 results
compared to 2009 were lower due to decreased revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense due to lower margins realized on market and affiliate power sales primarily due to unfavorable market conditions, lower mark-to-market gains on economic
hedging activities and increased nuclear fuel costs; partially offset by higher capacity revenues, including RPM, and favorable settlements on the ComEd swap.        
        Generation s 2010 results compared to 2009 were further affected
by lower operating and maintenance expenses. Lower operating and maintenance expenses were primarily due to the impact of a $223 million charge associated with the impairment of the Handley and Mountain Creek stations recorded in 2009. Lower
operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher expense due to the absence of ARO reductions that occurred in 2009; higher wages and benefits costs; and higher nuclear refueling outage costs in 2010. Additionally,
Generation s earnings decreased due to lower unrealized gains in its NDTs of the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units in 2010 compared to 2009.         
       Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.      Generation s 2009 results
compared to 2008 were lower due to decreased revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense due to lower realized margins on affiliate and market sales due to unfavorable market conditions, lower mark-to-market gains, reduced revenue from certain
long options in Generation s proprietary trading book and increased nuclear fuel costs. These decreases were partially offset by additional volumes available for market and retail sales, favorable settlements under the ComEd swap and reduced
customer credits issued to ComEd and Ameren.             
  Generation s 2009 results compared to 2008 were further affected by higher operating and maintenance expenses. Higher operating and maintenance
expenses were primarily due to a $223 million charge associated with the impairment of the Handley and Mountain Creek stations and costs associated with the announced shut-down of three coal-fired and one dual fossil-fired generation unit in
Pennsylvania. These actions were a direct result of current and future expected market conditions. Market conditions also contributed to lower than expected pension and postretirement plan asset returns in 2008, which resulted in higher pension and
other postretirement benefits expense in 2009. Higher operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the favorable results of Exelon s company-wide cost savings initiative and lower nuclear refueling outage costs.   
        Additionally, due to a significant rebound in the financial markets,
Generation experienced strong performance in its NDT funds in 2009. As a result, Generation s earnings improved as its NDTs of the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units had significant net realized and unrealized gains in 2009 compared to significant
net realized and unrealized losses in 2008.              Revenue Net of Purchased
Power and Fuel Expense              Generation has three
reportable segments, the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South and West regions representing the different geographical areas in which Generation s power marketing activities are conducted. Mid-Atlantic includes Generation s operations
primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland; Midwest includes the operations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota; and the South and West includes operations primarily in Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Idaho and Oregon.
           Generation evaluates the operating performance of its power
marketing activities using the measure of revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd and PECO. Purchased power costs include all costs
associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy   
         91

and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for internally-generated energy and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. Generation s retail gas, proprietary trading,
other revenue and mark-to-market activities are not allocated to a region.            For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008, Generation s revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense by region were as follows:   

(a)  
  Included in the Mid-Atlantic are the results of generation in New England.     

(b)  
  Results of transactions with PECO and ComEd are included in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, respectively.     

(c)  
  Includes retail gas activities and other operating revenues, which includes amounts paid related to the Illinois Settlement Legislation, decommissioning revenues from PECO and
fuel sales.     

(d)  
    In 2010, Other also includes the $57 million impairment charge for the ARP SO 2  allowances
further described in Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.            
  Generation s supply sources by region are summarized below:   

(a)  
  Includes Generation s proportionate share of the output of its nuclear generating plants, including Salem Generating Station (Salem), which is operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC

(b)

         Mid-Atlantic              Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . The $66 million decrease in
revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic was primarily due to unfavorable pricing relating to Generation s PPA with PECO and increased fuel expense. Additionally, increased sales to PECO resulted in less volumes
available for market sales.             Year Ended December 31,
2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  The $143 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Mid-Atlantic was primarily due to reduced volumes of sales and unfavorable pricing relating to
Generation s PPA with PECO, lower realized margins on market sales as well as increased costs of nuclear and fossil fuels.         
   Midwest          
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . The $67 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in the Midwest was primarily due to decreased realized margins on market sales in 2010 for the volumes previously sold under the 2006 ComEd auction contracts and for sales of the additional nuclear volumes at realized lower prices
as a result of unfavorable market conditions and increases in the price of nuclear fuel. These decreases were partially offset by increased payments under PJM s RPM auction and an increase in settlements on the ComEd swap as a result of
declining market prices in 2010.   
         93   

Table of Contents  

    Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  The $48
million increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the Midwest was primarily due to increased market and retail sales, including additional volumes sold under the ComEd RFP and increased settlements under the ComEd swap. These
increases were partially offset by lower volumes sold under the ComEd auction contract due to the expiration of certain tranches and increased nuclear fuel costs.   
         South and West             In the South and West, there are certain long-term purchase power agreements that have fixed capacity payments based on
unit availability. The extent to which these fixed payments are recovered is dependent on market conditions.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . The $14 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power
and fuel expense in the South and West was primarily due to lower realized margins due to unfavorable market conditions and outage activity, partially offset by capacity revenues received on long-term sale agreements that began in 2010.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2008.  The $44 million decrease in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense in the South and West was primarily due to lower realized margins due to unfavorable market conditions and higher fuel costs associated with
owned generation.             Trading Portfolio    
         Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2009 . The year ended December 31, 2010 includes revenue recorded from certain long options in the proprietary trading portfolio.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  The trading portfolio revenues decreased due primarily to
earnings in 2008 from certain long options in the proprietary trading portfolio.             Mark-to-market Gains and Losses             Generation is exposed to market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and enters into economic hedges to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations.             Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . Mark-to-market losses on power
hedging activities were $3 million in 2010, including the impact of the changes in ineffectiveness, compared to gains of $94 million in 2009. Mark-to-market gains on fuel hedging activities were $89 million in 2010 compared to gains of $87 million
in 2009. See Notes 8 and 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on gains associated with mark-to-market derivatives.         
   Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  Mark-to-market gains on power hedging activities were $94
million in 2009, including the impact of the changes in ineffectiveness, compared to gains of $414 million in 2008. Mark-to-market gains on fuel hedging activities were $87 million in 2009 compared to gains of $38 million in 2008. See Notes 8 and 9

    Other          
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . The increase in other is due to the
impacts of $77 million in reduced customer credits issued to ComEd and Ameren associated with the Illinois Settlement Legislation further described in Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This increase in other revenue
net of purchased power and fuel expense was partially offset by the $57 million impairment charge for the ARP SO   2    allowances further described in Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and $13 million in lower fuel sales.  
         Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2008.  The increase in other revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily due to the impacts of $123 million in reduced customer credits issued to ComEd and Ameren associated with the Illinois Settlement
Legislation further described in Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by $24 million in lower fuel sales.         
  Nuclear Fleet Capacity Factor and Production Costs   
        The following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for 2010, as
compared to 2009 and 2008, for the Exelon-operated plants. The nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average
annual mean capacity for that time period. Nuclear fleet production cost is defined as the costs to produce one MWh of energy, including fuel, materials, labor, contracting and other miscellaneous costs, but excludes depreciation and certain other
non-production related overhead costs. Generation considers capacity factor and production costs useful measures to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. Generation has included the analysis below as a complement to the financial
information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this
report.         

(a)  
  Excludes Salem, which is operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC.     

(b)  
  Excludes the $53 million reduction in fuel expense related to uranium supply agreement non-performance settlements.     
         Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2009 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor, which excludes Salem, increased primarily due to a lower number of outage days. For 2010 and 2009, scheduled refueling outage days totaled 261 and 263, respectively, and non-refueling
outage days totaled 57 and 78, respectively. Higher nuclear fuel costs and higher plant operating and maintenance costs, resulted in a higher production cost per MWh during 2010 as compared to 2009.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2008 . The nuclear fleet capacity factor decreased primarily due to a higher number of outage days. For 2009 and 2008, refueling outage days totaled 263 and 241, respectively, and non-refueling outage days totaled 78 and 59,
respectively. Higher nuclear fuel costs, partially offset by lower plant operating and maintenance costs resulted in a higher production cost per MWh during 2009 as compared to 2008.

     Depreciation and Amortization               Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . For 2010 as compared to 2009, the
increase in depreciation and amortization expense was a result of a change in the estimated useful lives of the plants associated with the 2009 announced shutdowns further described in Note 14 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which resulted in a depreciation expense increase of $48 million. Additionally, Generation completed a depreciation rate study during the first quarter of 2010, which resulted in a change in depreciation rate. The change in depreciation
rate resulted in an increase of $21 million. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher plant balances due to capital additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages).
            Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2008 . For 2009 as compared to 2008, the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was a result of a change in the estimated useful lives of the plants associated with the 2009 announced shutdowns, which resulted in $32
million of accelerated depreciation expense. Additionally, the change in the estimated useful life of a fossil-fired power plant in 2008 resulted in $18 million higher depreciation expense in 2009. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher
plant balances due to capital additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages), partially offset by the impact of the reassessment of the useful lives of several other
fossil-fired facilities in 2008 and reduced depreciation expense associated with the generating assets impaired in 2009.         
    Taxes Other Than Income           
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . For 2010 as compared to 2009, the increase was primarily due
to increased property taxes related to Generation s nuclear facilities.             Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 . For 2009 as compared to 2008, the increase was primarily due to a $9 million gross receipts tax adjustment in 2008.
             Interest Expense     
         Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2009 . For 2010 as compared to 2009, the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the debt issuances in 2010, further described in Note 10 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in
long-term debt resulted in higher interest expense of approximately $42 million.             Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 . For 2009 as compared to 2008, the decrease in interest expense reflects lower interest of $16 million on SNF obligations as a
result of lower rates. Interest on the spent fuel obligation accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate and is recalculated on a quarterly basis. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Additionally,
the decrease in interest expense reflects a $16 million increase in capitalized interest during 2009 as compared to 2008. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a $9 million increase in interest expense related to uncertain tax
positions.              Other, Net     
         Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2009 . For 2010 as compared to 2009, the decrease primarily reflects lower net unrealized gains on the NDT funds of its Non-Regulatory Agreement Units. See the table below for additional information. Additionally, the
  
         97   

Table of Contents  

decrease reflects the contractual elimination of $96 million of income tax expense associated with the NDT funds of the Regulatory Agreement Units in 2010 compared to the contractual elimination
of $181 million of income tax expense in 2009. These decreases are partially offset by the impacts of $71 million of expense related to long-term debt extinguished in the third and fourth quarter of 2009 further described in Note 10 of the Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.             Year Ended
December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 . For 2009 as compared to 2008, the increase reflects net unrealized gains in 2009 on the NDT funds of its Non-Regulatory Agreement Units as compared to net unrealized losses in
2008. See the table below for additional information. Additionally, the increase reflects the contractual elimination of $181 million of income tax expense associated with the NDT funds of the Regulatory Agreement Units in 2009 compared to the
contractual elimination of $202 million of income tax benefit in 2008. These increases are partially offset by the impacts of income in 2008 related to the termination of a gas supply guarantee and $71 million of expense related to long-term debt
extinguished in the third and fourth quarters of 2009.            The
following table provides unrealized and realized gains (losses) on the NDT funds of the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units recognized in Other, net for 2010, 2009 and 2008:   
     
            Effective Income Tax Rate.              Generation s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 37.4%, 40.3% and 33.4%, respectively. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.

    Results of Operations ComEd    

(a)  
  ComEd evaluates its operating performance using the measure of revenue net of purchased power expense. ComEd believes that revenue net of purchased power expense is a useful
measurement because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. In general, ComEd only earns margin based on the delivery and transmission of electricity. ComEd has included its discussion of revenue net of
purchased power expense below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, revenue net of purchased power expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies 
presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.                Net Income           
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease in ComEd s net income is primarily due to
the remeasurement of uncertain income tax positions in 2009 and 2010 related to the 1999 sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. These remeasurements resulted in increased interest expense and income tax expense recorded in 2010, and
increased interest income recorded in 2009. Net income was also reduced by higher incremental storm costs, higher depreciation and amortization expense reflecting higher plant balances, and the impact of Federal health care legislation signed into
law in March 2010. These reductions to net income were partially offset by higher revenue net of purchased power expense primarily due to favorable weather conditions, a net reduction in operating and maintenance expense, and the accrual of
estimated future refunds of the Illinois utility distribution tax for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.            The reduction in operating and maintenance expenses reflects the February 2010 approval by the ICC of ComEd s uncollectible accounts expense rider mechanism, the reduction of ComEd s ARO reserve in 2010,
and a charge in 2009 for severance expense incurred as a cost to achieve savings under Exelon s 2009 company-wide cost savings initiative.

    Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  The increase
in ComEd s net income was driven primarily by higher revenue net of purchased power expense, reflecting increased distribution rates effective September 16, 2008 due to an ICC rate order, partially offset by a decline in electric
deliveries, primarily resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and reduced load in 2009. In addition, ComEd s increase in net income reflected lower operating and maintenance expenses, lower interest expense, and higher interest income
related to the 2009 remeasurement of uncertain income tax positions.            The reduction in operating and maintenance expenses reflected Exelon s 2009 company-wide cost savings initiative. The initiative included job reductions, for which ComEd recorded a charge for severance expense
as a cost to achieve these savings. ComEd also benefited from decreased storm expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses reflected increased pension and other postretirement benefits expenses due to lower than expected pension and postretirement
plan asset returns in 2008. In the September 2008 rate case ruling, the ICC mandated fixed asset disallowances while allowing certain regulatory assets, which were recorded as a net one-time charge in 2008.   
        Depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to higher plant
balances and new depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2009. ComEd experienced a decrease in interest expense primarily due to lower outstanding debt in 2009.   
          Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power Expense    
        There are certain drivers to revenue that are fully offset by their
impact on purchased power expense, such as commodity procurement costs and customer choice programs. ComEd is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in electricity
procurement costs have no impact on electric revenue net of purchased power expense. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on ComEd s electricity procurement process.   
        Electric revenues and purchased power expense are affected by
fluctuations in customers  purchases from competitive electric generation suppliers. All ComEd customers have the ability to purchase electricity from an alternative electric generation supplier. The customer choice of electric generation
supplier does not impact the volume of deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied electricity. The number of retail customers purchasing electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers was 66,200 and
53,400 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing 52% of ComEd s annual retail kWh sales.         
  The changes in ComEd s electric revenue net of purchased power expense for 2010 compared to 2009 consisted of the following:

Table of Contents  

    Weather Delivery          
  Revenues net of purchased power expense were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to favorable weather conditions. The demand for electricity is
affected by weather conditions. Very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in other months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather conditions result in increased customer usage and delivery of
electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand.         
  Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal
weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in ComEd s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory consisted of the following:
        
           Uncollectible Accounts Recovery             In 2009, comprehensive legislation was enacted into law in Illinois providing public utility companies with the ability to recover from or refund to customers the difference between the utility s annual
uncollectible accounts expense and amounts collected in rates annually through a rider mechanism, starting with 2008 and prospectively. Recovery began in April 2010. During 2010, ComEd recognized recovery of $59 million associated with this rider
mechanism. This amount was offset by an equal amount of amortization of regulatory assets reflected in operating and maintenance expense.         
   Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs          
  As a result of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, utilities are required to provide energy efficiency and demand response programs and other
programs, and are allowed recovery of the costs of these programs from customers on a full and current basis through a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause. During 2010, ComEd recognized $85 million of revenue associated with these programs,
compared to $59 million in 2009. These amounts were offset by equal amounts in operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required programs. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
            Rider SMP Revenues    
        In October 2009, the ICC approved ComEd s proposed AMI pilot
program, with minor modifications, and recovery of substantially all program costs from customers via Rider SMP. During 2010, ComEd recognized $11 million of revenue associated with this program. This amount was offset by operating and maintenance
expense and depreciation expense of $11 million, which included a $4 million write off of the associated regulatory asset as a result of the September 30, 2010 ruling by the Illinois Appellate Court which denied future recover of ComEd s
AMI pilot program costs. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Illinois Appellate Court ruling.   
         Rate Relief Programs             ComEd funded less rate relief credits to customers in 2010 compared to 2009. Credits provided to customers are recorded
as a reduction to operating revenues; therefore, the reduction in credits resulted in an increase in revenues net of purchased power expense for 2010 compared to 2009. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.   
         101

    2007 City of Chicago Settlement    
        ComEd paid $3 million and $8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively,
under the terms of its 2007 settlement agreement with the City of Chicago. Payments were recorded as a reduction to revenues; therefore, the lower payment in 2010 resulted in a net increase in revenues net of purchased power expense for 2010
compared to 2009.             Volume Delivery    
        Revenues net of purchased power expense, exclusive of the effects of
weather, decreased primarily as a result of lower delivery volume to residential customers in 2010 as compared to 2009.         
   Revenues Subject to Refund (2007 Rate Case)          
  ComEd recorded an estimated refund obligation of $17 million in 2010 as a result of the September 30, 2010 Illinois Appellate Court ruling
regarding the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation in the 2007 Rate Case. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.             Other          
  Other revenues were higher in 2010 compared to 2009. Other revenues include revenues related to late payment charges, rental revenue, franchise
fees, transmission revenues and recoveries of environmental remediation costs associated with MGP sites.         
  The changes in ComEd s electric revenue net of purchased power expense for 2009 compared to 2008 consisted of the following:   
     
           Distribution Pricing    
        The increase in retail electric revenues net of purchased power
expense as a result of distribution pricing in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, reflected the impact of the 2007 Rate Case. The ICC issued an order in the 2007 Rate Case approving a $274 million increase in ComEd s annual revenue
requirement. The order became effective September 16, 2008 resulting in increased distribution revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
         Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs    
        As a result of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, utilities are
required to provide energy efficiency and demand response programs beginning June 1, 2008 and are allowed recovery of the costs of   
         102   

Table of Contents  

these programs from customers on a full and current basis through a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause. In 2009, ComEd recognized $59 million of revenue associated with these programs,
compared to $25 million in 2008. These amounts were offset by equal amounts in operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required programs. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
            2007 City of Chicago Settlement    
        ComEd paid $8 million and $18 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively,
under the terms of its 2007 settlement agreement with the City of Chicago. Payments were recorded as a reduction to revenues; therefore, the lower payment in 2009 resulted in a net increase in revenues net of purchased power expense for 2009
compared to 2008.             Transmission    
        Transmission revenues net of purchased power expense decreased
primarily due to a FERC order issued in 2008, which approved incentive recovery treatment of ComEd s largest transmission project. The cumulative recognition in 2008 of the 2007 effects of this order resulted in higher revenues in 2008 compared
to 2009. This was partially offset by the impact of higher transmission rates effective June 1, 2008 and June 1, 2009, resulting from ComEd s FERC approved formula rate. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information.             Volume delivery    
        The decrease in revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of
lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, in 2009 as compared to 2008, reflected decreased average usage per customer and fewer customers in the ComEd service territory.             Weather delivery          
  Revenues net of purchased power expense were lower due to unfavorable weather conditions in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes in heating and
cooling degree days in ComEd s service territory consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Reflects the impact of the leap year day in 2008.           
   Other             Other revenues were higher in 2009 compared to 2008. Other revenues include revenues related to late payment charges, assistance provided to other utilities through mutual assistance programs and recoveries of
environmental remediation costs associated with MGP sites.

(a)  
  On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order adopting ComEd s proposed tariffs filed in accordance with Illinois legislation providing public utilities the ability to
recover from or refund to customers the difference between the utility s annual uncollectible accounts expense and amounts collected in rates annually through a rider mechanism starting with 2008 and prospectively.     

(b)  
  In 2010, ComEd recovered $59 million of operating revenues through its uncollectible accounts expense rider mechanism. An equal amount of amortization of regulatory assets was
recorded in operating and maintenance expense. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     

(c)  
  As a result of the February 2010 ICC order, ComEd recorded a regulatory asset of $70 million and an offsetting reduction in operating and maintenance expense for the cumulative
under-collections in 2008 and 2009. In addition, ComEd recorded a one time contribution of $10 million associated with this legislation.

Other Than Income               Year Ended December 31,
2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009.  Taxes other than income taxes decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the accrual of estimated future refunds of Illinois utility distribution tax recorded in 2010 for the 2008 and 2009
tax years. Historically, ComEd has recorded refunds of the Illinois utility distribution tax when received. ComEd believes it now has sufficient, reliable evidence to record and support an estimated receivable associated with the anticipated refund
for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.            Year Ended
December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  Taxes other than income decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of $9 million of property tax settlements recorded in 2009. These settlements will result in
lower rates prospectively.              Interest Expense, Net

     Net Income           
   Year ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease in net income was primarily driven by increased
operating expenses partially offset by increased electric revenues net of purchased power expense. The increase in operating expenses reflected higher storm costs and increased scheduled CTC amortization expense. Electric revenues net of purchase
power expense increased as a result of favorable weather conditions and increased CTC recoveries.             Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008.  The increase in net income was driven primarily by increased operating revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense and
decreased interest expense, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. The increase in revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense was primarily related to increased gas distribution rates effective January 1, 2009, which
were partially offset by reduced electric load.            PECO s
operating expenses increased as a result of increased scheduled CTC amortization expense and pension and other postretirement benefits expense due to lower than expected pension and postretirement plan asset returns in 2008. The increased operating
expenses were partially offset by decreased allowance for uncollectible accounts expense.              Operating Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense          
  There are certain drivers to operating revenue that are offset by their impact on purchased power expense and fuel expense, such as commodity
procurement costs and customer choice programs. Gas revenues and fuel expense are affected by fluctuations in natural gas procurement costs. PECO s purchased natural gas cost rates charged to customers are subject to quarterly adjustments
designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased natural gas and the amount included in rates in accordance with the PAPUC s PGC. Therefore, fluctuations in natural gas procurement costs have no impact on gas
revenue net of fuel expense. The average purchased gas cost rate per mmcf was $7.66, $8.80 and $11.31 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. PECO s electric generation rates charged to customers were capped
until December 31, 2010 in accordance with the 1998 restructuring settlement. Under PECO s full requirements PPA with Generation, which expired on December 31, 2010, purchased power costs were based on the energy component of the
rates charged to customers. Electric revenues and purchased power expense fluctuate in relation to customer class usage as each customer class was charged a different capped electric generation rate; however, there is no impact on electric revenue
net of purchased power expense.            Electric revenues and
purchased power expense are also affected by fluctuations in customer choice program participation. All PECO customers have the choice to purchase energy from a competitive electric generation supplier. This choice does not impact the volume of
deliveries, but affects revenue collected from customers related to supplied energy. The number of retail customers purchasing energy from a competitive electric generation supplier was 36,600, 21,700 and 24,800 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively, representing 2%, 1% and 2% of total retail customers, respectively. Due to PECO s transition to market-based procurement of electric supply on January 1, 2011, the number of customers that choose to purchase generation
service from a competitive electric generation supplier is expected to increase in the first quarter of 2011 and beyond.

Table of Contents  

   The changes in PECO s operating revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense for the year
ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 consisted of the following:         
           Weather    
        The demand for electricity and gas is affected by weather conditions.
With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as  favorable weather conditions  because these weather
conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. Electric revenues net of purchased power expense were higher due to favorable weather conditions during the summer months of 2010 in
PECO s service territory. The increase was partially offset by the lower gas revenues net of fuel expense primarily as a result of unfavorable weather conditions in the winter months of 2010 compared to 2009.   
        Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect
the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling
degree days in PECO s service territory for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and normal weather consisted of the following:   
     
           CTC Recoveries          
  The increase in electric revenues net of purchased power expense as a result of CTC recoveries reflected a scheduled increase to the CTC component
of the capped generation rates charged to customers, which resulted in a decrease to the energy component and reduced purchase power expense under the PPA. Due to the lower than expected sales volume in 2009, the CTC increase was necessary to ensure
full recovery of stranded costs during the final year of the transition period that expired on December 31, 2010.         
   Regulatory Required Programs Cost Recovery          
  The increase in electric revenues relating to regulatory required programs was due to the recovery of $56 million and $3 million in costs associated
with the energy efficiency program and the consumer education program, respectively, which included $6 million related to gross receipts taxes. The costs of these programs are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved
regulated rates and have been reflected in operating and maintenance expense for regulatory required

result of pricing reflected an increase in the average price charged to commercial and industrial customers due to decreased usage per customer. The rates charged to customers decrease when usage exceeds a certain threshold.   
         Other    
        The decrease in other electric revenues net of purchased power expense
primarily reflected decreased transmission revenue earned by PECO as a transmission owner for the use of PECO s transmission facilities in PJM.         
  The decrease in other gas revenues net of fuel expense primarily reflected lower late payment revenues in 2010 compared to 2009.   
        The changes in PECO s electric revenue net of purchased power
expense and gas revenue net of fuel expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 consisted of the following:         
           Weather    
        Electric revenues net of purchased power expense were lower due to the
impact of unfavorable 2009 weather conditions in PECO s service territory and gas revenues net of fuel expense were higher due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in PECO s service territory in the winter months of 2008. The
changes in heating and cooling degree days for the twelve months ended 2009 and 2008, consisted of the following:

    CTC Recoveries          
  The decrease in electric revenues net of purchased power expense related to CTC recoveries was a result of lower delivery volumes due to unfavorable
weather conditions and decreased usage across all customer classes.             Gas
distribution rate increase             The increase in gas
revenues net of fuel expense reflected increased distribution rates effective January 1, 2009 resulting from the settlement of the 2008 gas distribution rate case.   
         Volume    
        The decrease in revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense as a
result of lower delivery volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, reflected decreased electric usage per customer across all customer classes as well as decreased gas usage across the small commercial and industrial customer class.   
         Pricing    
        The increase in electric revenues net of purchased power expense as a
result of pricing reflected lower PECO electric distribution rates in 2008 due to the refund of the 2007 PURTA settlement to customers. The rate change had no impact on operating income because it was offset by the amortization of the
regulatory liability related to the 2007 PURTA settlement reflected in taxes other than income.             Other             The
increase in other electric revenues net of purchased power expense reflected an increase in revenues associated with volume shifts among customer classes, which resulted in a different profile of rates as different customer classes are charged
different rates.              Operating and Maintenance Expense

Operating and Maintenance for Regulatory Required
Programs               Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared
to Year Ended December 31, 2009 . Operating and maintenance expense related to regulatory required programs for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of costs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through approved
regulated rates. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues during the current period. These expenses consisted of $50 million and $3 million related to energy efficiency and consumer education programs, which began in
2010.              Depreciation and Amortization Expense     
        The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2010
compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008 consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  The increase in PECO s scheduled CTC amortization recorded was in accordance with its 1998 restructuring settlement and was fully amortized as of December 31, 2010.
               Taxes Other Than Income
             The increase in taxes other than income for 2010
compared to 2009 and in 2009 compared to 2008 consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  The increase in taxes other than income related to PURTA amortization reflects the impact of regulatory liability amortization recorded in 2009 and 2008 that offset the
distribution rate reduction made to refund the 2007 PURTA settlement to customers.     
         113   

Table of Contents  

(b)  
  The increase in tax expense for 2010 compared to 2009 reflected increased gross receipts tax as a result of higher revenue. The decrease in tax expense for 2009 compared to 2008
was due to a gross receipts tax rate reduction that became effective on January 1, 2009.           
    Interest Expense, Net           
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009  .  The increase in interest expense, net for 2010 compared to 2009
was primarily due to a change in measurement of uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting guidance. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. This increase was partially offset by
a decrease in interest expense resulting from the retirement of the PETT transition bonds on September 1, 2010. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   
         Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
2008  .  The decrease in interest expense, net for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in the outstanding debt balance owed to PETT, partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with a higher amount of
outstanding long-term first and refunding mortgage bonds.         
    Loss in Equity Method Investments           
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009  .  The decrease in the loss in equity method investments for 2010
compared to 2009 was due to the consolidation of PETT in accordance with authoritative guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities effective January 1, 2010. PETT was dissolved on September 20, 2010. See Note 1 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.              Other, Net           
   Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009  .  The decrease in Other, net for 2010 compared to 2009 was
primarily due to decreased investment income and a decrease in interest income related to a change in measurement of uncertain income tax positions in 2010. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.             Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2008  .  The decrease in Other, net for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the impact of interest income recorded in 2009 related to the SSCM settlement. See Note 19 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details of the components of Other, net.              Effective Income Tax Rate              PECO s effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 31.9%, 29.3% and 31.6%, respectively.

Capital Resources             The Registrants  operating and
capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants  businesses are capital intensive and
require considerable capital resources. Each Registrant s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general.
If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO have access to unsecured revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank
commitments of $957 million, $4.8 billion, $1 billion and $574 million, respectively. The Registrants  credit facilities largely extend through October 2012 for Exelon, Generation and PECO. Exelon anticipates refinancing these credit
facilities in the first half of 2011. The ComEd credit facility extends through March 2013. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of
credit. See Note 10 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants  debt and credit agreements. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements.            The Registrants primarily use
their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of
cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, ComEd and PECO operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such
recovery takes place over an extended period of time.

     Cash Flows from Operating Activities     
         General    
        Generation s cash flows from operating activities primarily
result from the sale of electric energy to wholesale customers. Generation s future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at
competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers. ComEd s and PECO s cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, gas distribution
services to an established and diverse base of retail customers. ComEd s and PECO s future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their
rates or operations, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions. See Notes 2 and 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.
            Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
            Management considers various factors when making
pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, management of the
pension obligation and regulatory implications. Exelon contributed $2.1 billion to its pension plans in January 2011, representing all currently planned 2011 qualified pension plan contributions, of which Generation, ComEd and PECO contributed $952
million, $871 million and $110 million, respectively. Exelon contributed $766 million and $441 million to its pension plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 13 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the
Registrants  2010 and 2009 pension contributions.         
  Exelon s planned funding of the $2.1 billion in contributions includes $500 million from cash from operations, $750 million from the tax
benefits of making the pension contributions and $850 million with the accelerated cash tax benefits from the 100% bonus depreciation provision enacted as part of the Tax Relief Act of 2010. These cash tax benefits will be realized over the course
of 2011. As a result, the Registrants used other short-term liquidity sources and ComEd s January 2011 $600 million debt issuance, to fund a portion of the contribution on a short-term, interim basis until these cash tax benefits are realized.
           Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon s other
postretirement plans are not subject to regulatory minimum contribution requirements. Management considers several factors in determining the level of contributions to Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit
claims paid and regulatory implications. Exelon expects to contribute $185 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2011, of which Generation, ComEd and PECO expect to contribute $85 million, $58 million and $29 million, respectively.
Exelon contributed $203 million and $157 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts do not reflect Federal prescription drug subsidy payments received of $10 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 13 of the

    Tax Matters    
        The Registrants  future cash flows from operating activities may
be affected by the following tax matters:         

In the third quarter of 2010, Exelon and IRS Appeals reached a nonbinding, preliminary agreement to settle Exelon s involuntary conversion and CTC
positions. Under the terms of the preliminary agreement, Exelon estimates that the IRS will assess tax and interest of approximately $300 million in 2011, and that Exelon will receive additional tax refunds of approximately $270 million between 2011
and 2014. In order to stop additional interest from accruing on the IRS expected assessment, Exelon made a payment in December 2010 to the IRS of $302 million. During 2010, Exelon and IRS Appeals failed to reach a settlement with respect to the
like-kind exchange position and the related substantial understatement penalty. See Note 11 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding potential cash flows impacts of a fully successful IRS
challenge to Exelon s like-kind exchange position.            

The IRS anticipates issuing guidance in the first half of 2011 on the appropriate tax treatment of repair costs for electric transmission and distribution
assets. Upon issuance of this guidance, ComEd and PECO will assess its impact, and if it results in a cash benefit to Exelon, ComEd and PECO will file a request for change in method of tax accounting for repair costs. PECO s approved 2010
electric and natural gas distribution rate case settlements stipulate that the expected cash benefit resulting from the application of the new methodology to prior tax years must be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. The prospective tax
benefit claimed as a result of the new methodology should be reflected in tax expense in the year in which it is claimed on the tax return and will be reflected in the determination of revenue requirements in the next electric and natural gas
distribution base rate cases.            

The Tax Relief Act of 2010, enacted into law on December 17, 2010, includes provisions accelerating the depreciation of certain property for tax purposes.
Qualifying property placed into service after September 8, 2010, and before January 1, 2012, is eligible for 100% bonus depreciation. Additionally, qualifying property placed into service during 2012 is eligible for 50% bonus depreciation.
These provisions will generate approximately $1 billion of cash for Exelon (approximately $850 million in 2011 and approximately $170 million in 2012). The cash generated is an acceleration of tax benefits that Exelon would have otherwise received
over 20 years. Additionally, while the capital additions at ComEd and PECO generally increase future revenue requirements, the bonus depreciation associated with these capital additions will partially mitigate any future rate increases through the
ratemaking process. See further details regarding the use of the cash generated in the  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  section above.      

Given the current economic environment, state and local governments are facing increasing financial challenges, which may increase the risk of additional income
tax levies, property taxes, and other taxes.

Table of Contents  

   The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting Exelon s cash flows from
operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:         

(a)  
  Represents depreciation, amortization and accretion, net mark-to-market gains on derivative transactions, deferred income taxes, provision for uncollectible accounts, pension and
non-pension postretirement benefit expense, equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates and investments, decommissioning-related items, stock compensation expense, impairment of long-lived assets, and other non-cash charges.

(b)  
  Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities exclude the changes in commercial paper, income taxes and the current portion of long-term debt.
             Cash flows provided by operations for 2010,
2009 and 2008 by Registrant were as follows:         
          Changes in Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each Registrant s respective results of operations, as adjusted by
changes in working capital in the normal course of business. In addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:   
         Generation    

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Generation had net (postings) collections of counterparty collateral of $(1) million, $195 million and $1,029 million, respectively.
Net collateral activity is primarily the result of changes in market conditions. Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted or collected from its counterparties.
This collateral may be in various forms, such as cash, which may be obtained through the issuance of commercial paper, or letters of credit.            

During 2007, Generation, along with ComEd and other generators and utilities, reached an agreement with various representatives from the State of Illinois to
address concerns about higher electric bills in Illinois. Generation committed to contributing approximately $747 million over four years. As part of the agreement, Generation contributed cash of approximately $23 million in 2010, $118 million in
2009 and $274 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, Generation had fulfilled its commitments under the Illinois Settlement Legislation.      
         119   

Table of Contents  

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Generation s accounts receivable from ComEd (decreased) increased by $(65) million, $(28) million and $134 million,
respectively, primarily due to changes in receivables for energy purchases related to its SFC, ICC-approved RFP contracts and financial swap contract.      

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Generation had net payments of approximately $124 million, $40 million and $124 million, respectively, related to purchases and sales
of options. The level of option activity in a given year may vary due to several factors, including changes in market conditions as well as changes in hedging strategy.                ComEd          

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, ComEd s payables to Generation (decreased) increased by $(65) million, $(28) million and $134 million, respectively, primarily
due to changes in payables for energy purchases related to its SFC, ICC-approved RFP contracts and financial swap contract.            

During 2010, ComEd posted $153 million of cash collateral to PJM. Prior to the second quarter of 2010, ComEd used letters of credit to cover all PJM collateral
requirements.                PECO    

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, PECO s payables to other energy suppliers for energy purchases increased (decreased) by $1 million, $(43) million and $(12)
million, respectively. The 2009 decrease in payables to other energy suppliers is primarily due to an agreement executed in February 2009 between PECO, Generation and PJM that changed the way that PECO and Generation administer their PPA for default
service.                 Cash Flows used in Investing Activities
             Cash flows used in investing activities for 2010,

Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.              Generation.   Approximately 40% of the projected 2011 capital expenditures at Generation are for the
acquisition of nuclear fuel, with the remaining amounts reflecting additions and upgrades to existing facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). Included in the projected 2011 capital expenditures are a
series of planned power uprates across the company s nuclear fleet. See  EXELON CORPORATION Executive Overview,  for more information on nuclear uprates.   
          ComEd and PECO.   Approximately 81% and 88% of the
projected 2011 capital expenditures at ComEd and PECO, respectively, are for continuing projects to maintain and improve company operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as
PECO s transmission system reliability upgrades required by PJM related to Generation s plant retirements. The remaining amounts are for capital additions to support new business and customer growth, which for PECO includes capital
expenditures related to its smart meter program and SGIG project, net of DOE expected reimbursements. See Notes 2 and 5 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ComEd and PECO are each continuing to
evaluate their total capital spending requirements. ComEd and PECO anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.

and as market conditions warrant, the Registrants may engage in long-term debt retirements via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable options to reduced debt on their respective balance sheets.   
          Dividends.   Cash dividend payments and distributions
during 2010, 2009 and 2008 by Registrant were as follows:         

(a)  
  During 2008, ComEd did not pay a dividend to manage cash flows and its capital structure.     
        On January 25, 2011, the Exelon Board of Directors declared a
quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share on Exelon s common stock, which is payable on March 10, 2011 to shareholders of record at the end of the day on February 15, 2011.              Share Repurchases.   During 2008, Exelon purchased $500 million of common stock under Exelon s
accelerated share repurchase program, including the impact of the settlement of a forward contract indexed to Exelon s own common stock.             
    Short-Term Borrowings.   Short-term borrowings incurred (repaid) during 2010, 2009 and 2008 by Registrant were as follows:

     Other.   Other significant financing activities for Exelon for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as
follows:         

Exelon s other financing activities during 2010, 2009 and 2008 include $3 million, $5 million and $60 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits related
to compensation cost recognized for stock options exercised.                 Credit Matters                Market Conditions              The Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper
markets and large diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include $7.4 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $6.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2010, and of which no financial institution has more than 10% of
the aggregate commitments for Exelon, Generation, ComEd. Generation also had additional letter of credit facilities that expired in the second quarter of 2010, which were used to enhance variable rate long-term tax-exempt debt totaling $213 million.
Generation repurchased the $213 million of tax-exempt bonds during 2010 and has permanently extinguished $24 million of these tax-exempt bonds. Generation has the ability to remarket the remaining bonds whenever it determines it to be economically
advantageous. Exelon, Generation, PECO and ComEd had access to the commercial paper market during 2010 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. Due to an upgrade in ComEd s commercial paper rating in 2010 and improvements in
the commercial paper market, ComEd has been able to rely on the commercial paper market as a source of liquidity. ComEd also utilized its credit facility in 2010 to fund its short-term liquidity needs and provide credit enhancement for $191 million
of variable rate tax-exempt bonds. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price
movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions
associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See PART I. ITEM 1A Risk Factors for further information regarding the effects of
uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.            The
Registrants believe their cash flow from operations, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If Generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2010, it would have been required
to provide incremental collateral of approximately $1,156 million, which is well within its current available credit facility capacities of approximately $4.6 billion. The $1,156 million includes $944 million of collateral obligations for
derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payable and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements and $212 million of financial assurances that Generation would be
required to provide NEIL related to annual retrospective premium obligations. If ComEd lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2010, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of approximately $233 million,
which is well within its current available credit facility capacity of approximately $804 million. If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2010, it would have been required to provide collateral of $5 million pursuant
to PJM s credit policy and could have been required to provide collateral of approximately $68 million related to its natural gas procurement contracts, which are well within PECO s current available credit facility capacity of $573
million.

Credit Matters               Capital Structure
            At December 31, 2010, the capital structures of
the Registrants consisted of the following:         

(a)  
  Includes approximately $390 million, $206 million and $184 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd and PECO, respectively, that qualify as special purpose
entities under the applicable authoritative guidance. These special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd and PECO. See Note 1 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the authoritative guidance for VIEs.           
   Intercompany Money Pool          
  To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external
financing, Exelon operates an intercompany money pool. As of January 10, 2006, ComEd voluntarily suspended its participation in the money pool. Generation, PECO, and BSC may participate in the intercompany money pool as lenders and
borrowers, and Exelon may participate as a lender. Funding of, and borrowings from, the intercompany money pool are predicated on whether the contributions and borrowings result in economic benefits. Interest on borrowings is based on short-term
market rates of interest or, if from an external source, specific borrowing rates. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the intercompany money pool by participant during 2010 are described in the following table in addition to the net
contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2010:         
           Shelf Registrations             The Registrants filed automatic shelf registration statements that are not required to specify the amount of securities to be offered thereon. As of December 31, 2010, the Registrants each had current shelf
registration statements for the sale of unspecified amounts of securities that were effective with the SEC. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off its shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend
on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.   
         128   

Table of Contents  

    Regulatory Authorizations    
        The issuance by ComEd and PECO of long-term debt or equity securities
requires the prior authorization of the ICC and PAPUC, respectively. ComEd and PECO normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific
financing. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd had $577 million in long-term debt refinancing authority from the ICC and $1.1 billion in new money long-term debt financing authority. After ComEd issued $600 million of First Mortgage Bonds, Series
110, on January 18, 2011, its new money long-term debt financing authority with the ICC was reduced to $520 million. As of December 31, 2010, PECO had $1.9 billion in long-term debt financing authority from the PAPUC.   
        FERC has financing jurisdiction over ComEd s and PECO s
short-term financings and all of Generation s financings. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd and PECO had short-term financing authority from FERC that expires on December 31, 2011 of $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
Generation currently has blanket financing authority that it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate authority. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   
        Exelon s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on
the payment to it of dividends by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. The Federal Power Act
declares it to be unlawful for any officer or director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  In addition, under Illinois
law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless ComEd has specific
authorization from the ICC. At December 31, 2010, Exelon had retained earnings of $9,304 million, including Generation s undistributed earnings of $2,633 million, ComEd s retained earnings of $331 million consisting of retained
earnings appropriated for future dividends of $1,970 million partially offset by $1,639 million of unappropriated retained deficit, and PECO s retained earnings of $522 million. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding fund transfer restrictions.

Item 7A.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            
  The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity
prices. Exelon s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief risk officer and
includes the chief financial officer, general counsel, treasurer, vice president of strategy, vice president of audit services and officers representing Exelon s business units. The RMC reports to the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of
the risk management activities.               Commodity
Price Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather
conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon has price risk from commodity price movements.
Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the purchase and sale of electricity, fossil fuel, and other commodities.         
    Generation           
    Normal Operations and Hedging Activities.   Electricity available from Generation s owned or contracted generation supply in
excess of Generation s obligations to customers, including ComEd s and PECO s retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce price risk caused by market   
         133   

Table of Contents  

fluctuations, Generation enters into physical contracts as well as financial derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge
anticipated exposures. Generation believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges, including the ComEd
financial swap contract, will occur during 2011 through 2013. Generation s energy contracts are accounted for under the accounting guidance for derivatives as further discussed in Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.            In general, increases and decreases in forward
market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity risk on a ratable basis over the three years leading to the
spot market. As of December 31, 2010, the percentage of expected generation hedged was 90%-93%, 67%-70% and 32%-35% for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales
divided by the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include cash flow
hedges, other derivatives and certain non-derivative contracts including sales to ComEd and PECO to serve their retail load.         
  A portion of Generation s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices,
which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation s non-trading portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the
annual average Ni-Hub and PJM-West around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2010 market conditions and hedged position would be a decrease in pre-tax net income of approximately $33 million, $275 million and $531 million,
respectively, for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Power prices sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation expects to actively manage its portfolio to mitigate market price risk
exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation s portfolio.   
          Proprietary Trading Activities.   Generation also
enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into purely to profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an exposure and is subject to limits
established by Exelon s RMC. The trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits, including volume, stop loss and Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits to manage exposure to market risk.
Additionally, the Exelon risk management group and Exelon s RMC monitor the financial risks of the proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities, which included physical volumes of 3,625 GWh, 7,578 GWh and 8,891 GWh for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s overall revenue from energy marketing activities. Trading portfolio
activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted in pre-tax gains of $27 million due to net mark-to-market gains of $2 million and realized gains of $25 million. Generation uses a 95% confidence interval, one day holding period,
one-tailed statistical measure in calculating its VaR. The daily VaR on proprietary trading activity averaged $140,000 of exposure over the last 18 months. Because of the relative size of the proprietary trading portfolio in comparison to
Generation s total gross margin from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $6,562 million, Generation has not segregated proprietary trading activity in the following tables.   
          Fuel Procurement   .  Generation procures coal
and natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained primarily through long-term contracts for uranium concentrates, and long-term contracts for conversion services, enrichment
services and fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for coal, natural gas, uranium concentrates and certain   
         134   

Table of Contents  

nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to
the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 57% of Generation s uranium concentrate requirements from 2011 through 2015 are supplied by three producers.
In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements.
Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding uranium and coal supply agreement matters.              ComEd              The
financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd was deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, thereby ensuring that ComEd will be entitled to receive full cost recovery in rates. The change in fair value each period is recorded by
ComEd with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability.         
  The contracts that ComEd has entered into as part of the initial ComEd auction and the RFP contracts are deemed to be derivatives that qualify for
the normal purchases and normal sales exception under derivative accounting guidance. ComEd does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.         
  On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers regarding the
procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under these contracts begins in June 2012. Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value
each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivatives.              PECO           
  Prior to January 1, 2011, PECO had transferred substantially all of its commodity price risk related to its procurement of electric supply to
Generation through a PPA that expired on December 31, 2010. The PPA was not considered a derivative under current authoritative derivative guidance. Pursuant to PECO s PAPUC-approved DSP Program, PECO began to procure electric supply for
default service customers in June 2009 for the post-transition period beginning on January 1, 2011 through block contracts and full requirements contracts. PECO s full requirements contracts and block contracts that are considered
derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception under current authoritative derivative guidance. Under the DSP Program, PECO is permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up.
           PECO has also entered into derivative natural gas
contracts, which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception, to hedge its long-term price risk in the natural gas market. PECO s hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on its financial position or
results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.            PECO does not enter into derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. For additional information on these contracts, see Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
             Trading and Non-Trading Marketing
Activities.   The following detailed presentation of Exelon s, Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s trading and non-trading marketing activities is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy
industry s Committee of Chief Risk Officers (CCRO).

  For Generation, includes $375 million and $782 million of gains related to the changes in fair value of the five-year financial swap with ComEd for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $3 million and $2 million of gains related to the changes in fair value of the block contracts with PECO for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The PECO block contracts
were designated as normal as of May 31, 2010. As such, there were no effective changes in fair value of PECO s block contracts for the remainder of 2010 as the mark-to-market balances previously recorded will be amortized over the term of
the contract.     

(e)  
  For ComEd and PECO, the changes in fair value are recorded as a change in regulatory assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, ComEd recorded a regulatory
asset of $971 million, related to its mark-to-market derivative liabilities. During 2010 and 2009, this includes $375 million and $782 million of increases related to changes in fair value, respectively, and $371 million and $267 million of
decreases, respectively, for reclassifications from regulatory asset to recognize cost in purchased power expense due to settlements of ComEd s five-year financial swap with Generation. During 2010 ComEd also recorded a $4 million increase in
fair value associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, PECO recorded a regulatory asset of $9 million and $4 million, respectively, related to its mark-to-market
derivative liabilities. During December 31, 2010 and 2009, PECO s change in fair value includes $3 million and $2 million related to changes in fair value, respectively, associated with the fair value of PECO s block contracts with
Generation. PECO s block contracts were designated as normal sales as of May 31, 2010. As such, there were no changes in fair value of PECO s block contracts with Generation for the remainder of 2010 and the mark-to-market balances
previously recorded will be amortized over the term of the contract beginning January 2011.     

(f)  
  Includes $73 million and $46 million of amounts reclassified to realized at settlement of contracts recorded to results of operations related to option premiums due to the
settlement of the underlying transactions for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.     

(g)  
  Amounts related to the five-year financial swap between Generation and ComEd and the block contracts between Generation and PECO are eliminated in consolidation.
               Fair Values     
        The following tables present maturity and source of fair value of the
Registrants mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities). The tables provide two fundamental pieces of information. First, the tables provide the source of fair value used in determining the carrying amount of the Registrants  total
mark-to-market net assets (liabilities). Second, the tables show the maturity, by year, of the Registrants  energy contract net assets (liabilities), giving an indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and either generate or
require cash. See Note 8 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy.

ComEd     
        Credit risk for ComEd is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. ComEd is currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its franchised territory. ComEd records a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical
experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. ComEd will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. In February 2010, the ICC approved
ComEd s tariffs to adjust rates annually through a rider mechanism to reflect increases or decreases in annual uncollectible accounts expense. The Illinois Settlement Legislation prohibits utilities, including ComEd, from terminating electric
service to a residential electric space heat customer due to nonpayment between December 1 of any year through March 1 of the following year. ComEd s ability to disconnect non space-heating residential customers is also impacted by
certain weather restrictions, at any time of year, under the Illinois Public Utilities Act. ComEd will monitor the impact of its disconnection practices and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. ComEd did
not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2010. See Note 2 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ComEd s recently approved tariffs to adjust
rates annually through a rider mechanism to reflect increases or decreases in annual uncollectible accounts expense.         
  ComEd s power procurement contracts provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market
prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the benchmark
price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents ComEd s credit exposure. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd s credit exposure to energy suppliers
was immaterial.              PECO     
        Credit risk for PECO is managed by credit and collection policies,
which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. PECO is currently obligated to provide service to all retail electric customers within its franchised territory. PECO records a provision for uncollectible accounts, primarily based
  
         140   

Table of Contents  

upon historical experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. In accordance with PAPUC regulations, after November 30 and before April 1, an electric
distribution utility or natural gas distribution utility shall not terminate service to customers with household incomes at or below 250% of the Federal poverty level. PECO s provision for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by
changes in prices as well as changes in PAPUC regulations. PECO did not have any customers representing over 10% of its revenues as of December 31, 2010.         
  PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP Program contracts, which define a supplier s performance assurance
requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s lowest credit rating from S P, Fitch or Moody s and the
supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed, compared to the current forward price curve for energy. If the forward price
curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2010, PECO s credit exposure to
suppliers under its electric procurement contracts was immaterial.            PECO does not obtain collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and management agreements. As of December 31, 2010, PECO had credit exposure of $10 million under its natural gas supply and
management contracts.              Collateral (Generation, ComEd and PECO)
               Generation     
        As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters
into physical or financial contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, fossil fuel and other commodities. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit Generation and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of
future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is
possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation s net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting
of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of
the demand. If Generation can reasonably claim that it is willing and financially able to perform its obligations, it may be possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of
future payments should be sufficient. See Note 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding collateral requirements.         
  Generation sells output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of
counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon s and Generation s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As
market prices rise above contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation. In order to post
collateral, Exelon depends on access to bank credit facilities which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. Since the banking industry issues started to surface in mid-2007, credit markets have tightened. Exelon will be required
to renew most of its credit facilities in the 2011-2012 timeframe. The cost and availability to renew may be substantially different than when Exelon originally negotiated the existing liquidity facilities.

Table of Contents  

   As of December 31, 2010, Generation was holding $955 million of cash collateral deposits received
from counterparties and Generation had sent $3 million of cash collateral to counterparties. Net cash collateral deposits received of $951 million were offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2010, $1 million of
cash collateral received was not offset against net derivative positions because it was not associated with energy-related derivatives. As of December 31, 2009, Generation was holding $965 million of cash collateral deposits received from
counterparties and Generation had sent $12 million of cash collateral to counterparties. Net cash collateral deposits received of $947 million were offset mark-to-market assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, $6 million of cash
collateral received was not offset against net mark-to-market assets and liabilities. See Note 18 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.   
          ComEd     
        As of December 31, 2010, ComEd did not hold any cash or letters
of credit for the purpose of collateral from any of the suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts and held approximately $20 million in the form of cash and letters of credit for both annual and long-term renewable energy contracts.
See Notes 2 and 9 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
    PECO           
  As of December 31, 2010, PECO was not required to post collateral under its energy and natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 9 of the
Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.         
    RTOs and ISOs (Generation, ComEd and PECO)           
  Generation, ComEd and PECO participate in all, or some, of the established, real-time energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, New York
ISO, MISO, Southwest Power Pool, Inc. and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot markets that are operated by the RTOs or ISOs, as
applicable. In areas where there is no spot market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are
established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may under certain circumstances require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining
participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.   
          Exchange Traded Transactions (Generation)    
        Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX and
ICE. The NYMEX and ICE clearinghouse act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX and ICE must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on NYMEX and ICE are
significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.         
    Long-Term Leases (Exelon)           
  Exelon s consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2010, included a $629 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia and
Texas subject to long-term leases. This investment represents the estimated residual value of leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms of   
         142   

Table of Contents  

approximately $1.5 billion, less unearned income of $863 million. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the lease terms which are set at prices above
the then expected fair market value of the plants. If the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options the lessees return the leasehold interests to Exelon and Exelon has the ability to require the lessees to arrange a service contract with a
third party for a period following the lease term. In any event, Exelon is subject to residual value risk to the extent the fair value of the assets are less than the residual value. This risk is mitigated by the fair value of the fixed payments
under the service contract. The term of the service contract, however, is less than the expected remaining useful life of the plants and, therefore, Exelon s exposure to residual value risk will not be mitigated by payments under the service
contract in this remaining period. Lessee performance under the lease agreements is supported by collateral and credit enhancement measures including letters of credit, surety bonds and credit swaps. Management regularly evaluates the
creditworthiness of Exelon s counterparties to these long-term leases. Since 2008, the entity providing the credit enhancement for one of the lessees did not meet the credit rating requirements of the lease. Consequently, Exelon has
indefinitely extended a waiver and reduction of the rating requirement, which Exelon may terminate by giving 90 days notice to the lessee. Exelon monitors the continuing credit quality of the credit enhancement party.   
        Exelon performed annual assessments as of July 31, 2010 and 2009
of the estimated fair value of long-term lease investments and concluded that the estimated fair values at the end of the lease terms exceeded the residual values established at the lease dates and recorded as investments on Exelon s balance
sheet. Through December 31, 2010, no events have occurred or circumstances have changed that would require any formal reassessment subsequent to the July 2010 review.   
         Interest-Rate Risk (Exelon, Generation and ComEd)    
        The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt
to manage interest-rate exposure. The Registrants may also use interest rate swaps when deemed appropriate to adjust exposure based upon market conditions. Additionally, the Registrants may use forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate
locks to lock in interest-rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These strategies are employed to achieve a lower cost of capital. At December 31, 2010, Exelon had $100 million of notional amounts of fair value hedges outstanding. A
hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with variable-rate debt would result in less than a $1 million decrease in Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s pre-tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010. This
calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates.             Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)             Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning Generation s nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2010, Generation s decommissioning trust
funds are reflected at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in
decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors
the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a
$410 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further discussion of equity price risk as a result of the current capital and credit market conditions.

  A discussion of Generation s results of operations for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008 is set forth under  Results of
Operations Generation  in  EXELON CORPORATION Results of Operations  of this Form 10-K.             Liquidity and Capital Resources             Generation s business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. Generation s capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the
extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper, participation in the intercompany money pool or capital contributions from Exelon. Generation s access to external financing at reasonable terms
is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to where Generation no longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, Generation
has access to revolving credit facilities of $4.8 billion that Generation currently utilizes to support its commercial paper program and to issue letters of credit. Generation anticipates refinancing this facility during the first half of 2011.
           See the  EXELON CORPORATION Liquidity and Capital
Resources  and Note 10 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further discussion.         
  Capital resources are used primarily to fund Generation s capital requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, the payment of
distributions to Exelon, contributions to Exelon s pension plans and investments in new and existing ventures. Future acquisitions could require external financing or borrowings or capital contributions from Exelon.

Operations  of this Form 10-K.             Liquidity and Capital Resources
            PECO s business is capital intensive and requires
considerable capital resources. PECO s capital resources are primarily provided by internally generated cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, external financing, including the issuance of long-term debt, commercial paper or
participation in the intercompany money pool. PECO s access to external financing at reasonable terms is dependent on its credit ratings and general business conditions, as well as that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions
deteriorate to where PECO no longer has access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, PECO has access to a revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2010, PECO had access to a revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of
$574 million. PECO anticipates refinancing this facility during the first half of 2011. See the  Credit Matters  section of  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for additional discussion.   
        Capital resources are used primarily to fund PECO s capital
requirements, including construction, retirement of debt, the payment of dividends and contributions to Exelon s pension plans. Additionally, PECO operates in a rate-regulated environment in which the amount of new investment recovery may be
limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time.

   Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
        The management of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Exelon s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.         
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
        Exelon s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness
of Exelon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Exelon s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, Exelon s internal control over financial reporting was effective.            The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been

        To The Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Exelon Corporation:   
        In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)(i) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Exelon Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under item 15(a)(1)(ii) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.            A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

           1. Significant Accounting Policies (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd and PECO)              Description of Business (Exelon, Generation, ComEd
and PECO)             Exelon is a utility services holding company
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the generation and energy delivery businesses discussed below. The generation business consists of the electric generating facilities, the wholesale energy marketing operations and competitive retail supply
operations of Generation. The energy delivery businesses include the purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and the provision of transmission and distribution services by ComEd in northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago, and by
PECO in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia, and the purchase and regulated retail sale of natural gas and the provision of distribution services by PECO in the Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia.
            Basis of Presentation (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)
            Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon
provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. The costs of BSC, including support services, are directly charged or allocated
to the applicable subsidiaries using a cost-causative allocation method. Corporate governance type costs that cannot be directly assigned are allocated based on a Modified Massachusetts formula, which is a method that utilizes a combination of gross
revenues, total assets and direct labor costs for the allocation base. The results of Exelon s corporate operations are presented as  Other  within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless
otherwise disclosed.            Exelon owns 100% of all of its
significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for ComEd, of which Exelon owns more than 99%, and PECO, of which Exelon owns 100% of the common stock but none of PECO s preferred securities. Exelon has reflected
the third-party interests in ComEd, which totaled less than $1 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, as equity and PECO s preferred securities as preferred securities of subsidiaries in its consolidated financial
statements.            Generation owns 100% of all of its significant
consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for Exelon SHC, Inc., of which Generation owns 99% and the remaining 1% is indirectly owned by Exelon, which is eliminated in Exelon s consolidated financial statements; and
certain Exelon Wind projects, of which Generation holds a majority interest ranging from 94% to 99%, and which is included in Noncontrolling interest on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
        Exelon s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
entities in which Exelon has a controlling financial interest, other than certain financing trusts of ComEd and PECO, and Generation s and PECO s proportionate interests in jointly owned electric utility property, after the elimination of
intercompany transactions. A controlling financial interest is evidenced by either a voting interest greater than 50% or the results of a model that identifies Exelon or one of its subsidiaries as the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Investments and
joint ventures in which Exelon does not have a controlling financial interest and certain financing trusts of ComEd and PECO are accounted for under the equity or cost method of accounting.            Each of Generation s, ComEd s and PECO s consolidated financial statements includes the accounts of their
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.            Certain prior year amounts in Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and in Exelon s, ComEd s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets have been
reclassified between line items for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect net   
         178

income or cash flows from operating activities of the Registrants. See Note 19 Supplemental Financial Information for further discussion of the reclassifications to Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.         
  The Registrants performed an evaluation of subsequent events for the accompanying financial statements and notes included in Part 2, ITEM 8 of
this report through February 10, 2011, the date this Report was issued, to determine whether the circumstances warranted recognition and disclosure of those events or transactions in the financial statements as of December 31, 2010.
            Use of Estimates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and other postretirement benefits, inventory reserves, allowance for uncollectible accounts, goodwill and asset impairments, derivative instruments, fixed asset depreciation,
environmental costs, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.             Accounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)          
  Exelon, ComEd and PECO account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting policies prescribed by the regulatory authorities having
jurisdiction, principally the ICC and the PAPUC under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Exelon, ComEd and PECO apply the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires ComEd and
PECO to record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of rate regulation for utility operations that meet the following criteria: (1) third-party regulation of rates; (2) cost-based rates; and (3) a reasonable
expectation that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. Exelon
believes that it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. However, Exelon, ComEd and PECO continue to evaluate their respective abilities to apply the
authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, including consideration of current events in their respective regulatory and political environments. If a separable portion of ComEd s or PECO s business was no longer
able to meet the criteria discussed above, Exelon, ComEd and PECO would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which would have a material impact on their results of
operations and financial positions. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for additional information.             Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Under the applicable authoritative guidance, VIEs are legal entities that possess any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of
equity at risk to finance their activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or where equity holders do not
receive expected losses or returns significant to the VIE. Companies are required to consolidate a VIE if they are its primary beneficiary.

     Generation     
        Generation s wholesale operations include the physical delivery
and marketing of power obtained through its generating capacity, and long-, intermediate- and short-term contracts. Generation also has contracts to purchase fuel supplies for nuclear and fossil generation. These contracts and Generation s
membership in NEIL are discussed in further detail in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies. Generation has evaluated these contracts and determined that either it has no variable interest in an entity or, where Generation does have a variable
interest in an entity, it is not the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidation is not required.         
  For contracts where Generation has a variable interest, Generation has considered which interest holder has the power to direct the activities that
most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and thus is considered the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the entity. The primary beneficiary must also have exposure to significant losses or the right to receive
significant benefits from the VIE. In general, the most significant activity of the VIEs is the operation and maintenance of the facilities, which provides the operator with the power to direct the VIEs  activities. Facilities represent power
plants, sources of uranium and fossil fuels, or plants used in the uranium conversion, enrichment and fabrication process. Generation does not have control over the operation and maintenance of the facilities considered VIEs and it does not bear
operational risk of the facilities. Furthermore, Generation has no debt or equity investments in the entities, under the contracts Generation receives less than the majority of the output of the remaining expected useful life of the facilities, and
Generation does not provide any other financial support through liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments other than purchase commitments described in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies. Upon consideration of these factors,
Generation does not consider itself to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, accordingly, has determined that consolidation is not required.         
  Generation has historically aggregated its contracts with VIEs into two categories, energy commitments and fuel purchase obligations, based on the
similar risk characteristics and significance to Generation. As of the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheet that relate to its involvement with these VIEs are predominately
related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by Generation for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the contracts. Further, Generation has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity
support, or any liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts, so there is no significant potential exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIEs.   
        Several of Generation s long-term PPAs have been determined to be
operating leases that have no residual value guarantees, bargain purchase options or other provisions that would cause these operating leases to be variable interests.   
        On December 9, 2010, Generation completed the acquisition of all
of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC discussed further in Note 3 Acquisition. Generation evaluated the significant agreements and ownership structures and risks of each of the wind projects and underlying entities acquired, and
determined that the entities are variable interest entities for which Generation is the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. Each project was designed to develop, construct and operate a wind generation facility. Generation
owns 100% of most projects acquired; however, 11 of the projects have noncontrolling equity interests held by others (which range between 1% and 6%). Of the 11 projects, Generation s economic interests in nine of the projects is significantly
greater than its   
         180   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

stated contractual governance rights. However, Generation has determined that its significant economic interest in the projects provides the power to direct the activities most significant to the
projects. The primary factors considered in determining that Generation is the primary beneficiary were that Generation has the power to direct the operations and maintenance of the wind facilities, which is considered the activity that most
significantly affects the economic performance of the projects and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that are significant to the projects. The ownership agreements with the noncontrolling interests state that Generation
provide financial support to the projects in proportion to its economic interests in the projects (which range between 99% and 94%). No additional support to these projects beyond what was contractually required has been provided during 2010. As of
December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are consolidated as a result of Generation being the primary beneficiary of these entities primarily relate to the wind generating assets, PPA intangible assets and
working capital amounts.            Generation has entered into an
asset sale agreement with EnergySolutions, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including ZionSolutions, LLC (ZionSolutions), which is further discussed in Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations. Generation has evaluated this agreement and
determined that it has a variable interest in ZionSolutions but is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, Generation has concluded that consolidation is not required.   
          ComEd and PECO     
        ComEd s retail operations include the purchase of electricity and
RECs through procurement contracts of varying durations. PECO s retail operations include the purchase of electricity, AECs and natural gas through procurement contracts of varying durations. These contracts are discussed in further detail in
Note 2 Regulatory Matters and Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies. ComEd and PECO have evaluated these contracts and determined that either there is no variable interest, or where ComEd or PECO do have a variable interest in a VIE as
described below, it is not the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidation is not required.            For contracts where ComEd or PECO has a variable interest, consideration has been given to which interest holder has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the
VIE. In general, the most significant activity of the VIEs is the operation and maintenance of their production or procurement processes related to electricity, RECs, AECs or natural gas. ComEd and PECO do not have control over the operation and
maintenance of the entities considered VIEs and they do not bear operational risk related to the associated activities. Furthermore, ComEd and PECO have no debt or equity investments in the VIEs and do not provide any other financial support through
liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments other than purchase commitments described in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies. Accordingly, neither ComEd or PECO considers itself to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
           As of the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in ComEd s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheet that relate to their involvement with these VIEs were predominately related to working capital accounts and generally represented the amounts owed by ComEd and PECO
for the purchases associated with the current billing cycles under the contracts.            The financing trust of ComEd, ComEd Financing III, and the financing trusts of PECO, PECO Trust III and PECO Trust IV, are not consolidated in Exelon s, ComEd s or PECO s financial statements. These
financing trusts were created to issue mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. ComEd and PECO have concluded that they do not have a variable interest in ComEd   
         181

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

Financing III, PECO Trust III or PECO Trust IV as each Registrant financed its equity interest in the financing trusts through the issuance of subordinated debt and, therefore, has no equity at
risk. ComEd and PECO, as the sponsors of the financing trusts, are obligated to pay the operating expenses of the trusts.         
    PECO           
  PETT, a financing trust, was created in 1998 by PECO to purchase and own intangible transition property (ITP) and to issue transition bonds to
securitize $5 billion of PECO s stranded cost recovery authorized by the PAPUC pursuant to the Competition Act. PECO made an initial capital contribution of $25 million to PETT. ITP represented the irrevocable right of PECO to collect
intangible transition charges (ITC). ITC consisted of the portion of CTCs that were sold by PECO to PETT and securitized through the various issuances of PETT s transition bonds from 1999 through 2001 as authorized by the PAPUC. ITC provided
PETT with an asset sufficient to recover the aggregate principal amount of the transition bonds issued, plus amounts sufficient to provide for the credit enhancement, interest payments, servicing fees and other expenses relating to the transition
bonds. PETT s assets were restricted for the sole purpose of satisfying PETT s obligation to its transition bondholders and payment of various administrative fees. PECO did not provide ongoing financial support to PETT or guarantee
PETT s performance, and the transition bondholders did not have recourse to PECO. PECO had continuing involvement in PETT in its role as the servicer of the ITC collections, for which PECO received a fee. During the year ended December 31,
2010, net pre-tax losses of $16 million, related to PETT s results of operations were reflected in PECO s Consolidated Statements of Operations.         
  PETT was consolidated in Exelon s and PECO s financial statements on January 1, 2010 pursuant to authoritative guidance relating to
the consolidation of VIEs that became effective on that date. Under previously issued authoritative guidance, PETT was deconsolidated in accordance with a prescribed quantitative approach, based on expected losses, for determining the primary
beneficiary. Under the new guidance, PECO concluded that it was the primary beneficiary of PETT due to PECO s involvement in the design of PETT, its role as servicer of the ITC collections, and its right to dissolve PETT and receive any of its
remaining assets following retirement of the transition bonds and payment of PETT s other expenses. The consolidation of PETT did not have a significant impact on PECO s results of operations or statement of cash flows. Upon retirement of
the outstanding transition bonds on September 1, 2010, the remaining cash balance was remitted to PECO, and PETT was dissolved on September 20, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, PECO recognized interest expense on
PETT s transition bonds of $22 million, which was reflected in PECO s Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information regarding PETT s debt to bondholders.   
         Revenues (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
          Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues are recorded as
service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers. See Note 4 Accounts Receivable for further
information.              RTOs and ISOs.   In RTO and ISO
markets that facilitate the dispatch of energy and energy-related products, Exelon and Generation report sales and purchases conducted on a net hourly basis in either revenues or purchased power on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated
Statements of Operations,   
         182

the classification of which depends on the net hourly activity. ComEd nets its spot market purchases against its spot market sales on an hourly basis, with the result recorded in purchased power
expense. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, ComEd recorded an immaterial amount associated with hours where it had net spot market sales.         
    Option Contracts, Swaps and Commodity Derivatives.   Certain option contracts and swap arrangements that meet the definition of
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense, unless hedge accounting is applied. Premiums received and paid on option contracts are recognized as revenue or expense over
the terms of the contracts. If the derivatives meet hedging criteria, changes in fair value are recorded in OCI. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for its financial swap contract with Generation. Since ComEd is entitled to full recovery of the
costs of the financial swap contract in rates as settlements occur, ComEd records the fair value of the swap as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
          Trading Activities.   Exelon and Generation account for
Generation s trading activities under the provisions of the authoritative guidance for accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities, which require energy revenues and costs related to energy trading
contracts to be presented on a net basis in the income statement. Commodity derivatives used for trading purposes are accounted for using the mark-to-market method with unrealized gains and losses recognized in operating revenues.   
         Income Taxes (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Deferred Federal and state income taxes are provided on all
significant temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits previously utilized for income tax purposes have been deferred on the Registrants 
Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model
with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is
not more likely than not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have
met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense or in other income and deductions (interest income) on their Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
        Pursuant to the IRC and relevant state taxing authorities, Exelon and
its subsidiaries file consolidated or combined income tax returns for Federal and certain state jurisdictions where allowed or required. See Note 11 Income Taxes for further information.             Taxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)    
        Exelon, ComEd and PECO present any tax assessed by a governmental
authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer on a gross (included in revenues and costs) basis. See Note 19 Supplemental Financial Information for ComEd s and PECO s utility
taxes that are presented on a gross basis.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
    Cash and Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The Registrants consider investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.             Restricted Cash
and Investments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Restricted cash and investments represent restricted funds to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon
Corporate s restricted cash and investments primarily represented restricted funds for payment of medical, dental, vision and long-term disability benefits. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, Generation s restricted
cash and investments primarily represented restricted funds for qualifying design, engineering and construction costs related to pollution control notes issued by Generation for an emissions-control facilities project and for payment of certain
environmental liabilities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, PECO s restricted cash primarily represented funds from the sales of assets that were subject to PECO s mortgage indenture.   
        Restricted cash and investments not available to satisfy current
liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon and Generation had restricted cash and investments in the NDT funds classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, ComEd had
short-term investments in Rabbi trusts classified as noncurrent assets.         
   Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the
Registrants  best estimates of losses on the accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable agings, historical experience and other currently available information. ComEd and PECO estimate the
allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying internally developed loss rates to the outstanding receivable balance by risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators
that are computed based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on historical average charge-offs as a percentage of accounts
receivable in each risk segment. ComEd and PECO customers  accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. ComEd and PECO
customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. ComEd s and PECO s provisions for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as
changes in ICC and PAPUC regulations, respectively. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of uncollectible accounts receivable at ComEd.   
         Inventories (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Provisions are
recorded for excess and obsolete inventory.              Fossil
Fuel.   Fossil fuel inventory includes the weighted average costs of stored natural gas, propane, coal and oil. The costs of natural gas, propane, coal and oil are generally included in inventory when purchased and charged to fuel expense when
used or sold.   
         184   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
     Materials and Supplies.   Materials and supplies inventory generally includes the
average costs of transmission, distribution and generating plant materials. Materials are generally charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.   
          Emission Allowances.   Emission allowances are included in
inventory and other deferred debits and are carried at the lower of weighted average cost or market and charged to fuel expense as they are used in operations.         
   Marketable Securities (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  All marketable securities are reported at fair value. Marketable securities held in the NDT funds are classified as trading securities and all
securities that are not held by the NDT funds are classified as available-for-sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the former ComEd and former PECO nuclear generating
units (Regulatory Agreement Units) are included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd, and PECO and in noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in noncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized
gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation s NDT funds associated with the former AmerGen nuclear generating units and the portions of the Peach Bottom nuclear generating units not subject to a regulatory agreement (Non-Regulatory Agreement
Units) are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, for ComEd s and PECO s available-for-sale securities are reported in OCI. Any decline in the fair value of ComEd s and PECO s
available-for-sale securities below the cost basis is reviewed to determine if such decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the available-for-sale securities is written
down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in earnings. See Note 8 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for further information regarding the other-than-temporary impairment recorded in the
second quarter of 2009 by Exelon and ComEd related to ComEd s Rabbi trust investments. See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations for information regarding marketable securities held by NDT funds and Note 19 Supplemental Financial
Information for additional information regarding ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets and liabilities.             Property, Plant and Equipment (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes labor and materials, construction overhead, when appropriate,
capitalized interest for Generation and AFUDC for regulated property at ComEd and PECO. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to maintenance expense as
incurred.            Third parties reimburse ComEd and PECO for all or
a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are netted against the project costs. DOE SGIG funds reimbursed to PECO by the DOE are accounted for as CIAC.   
        For Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is charged to
accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, is capitalized when incurred to gross plant as part of the cost of the newly installed
asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to expense as incurred.   
         185

   For ComEd and PECO, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to
accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite method of depreciation. ComEd s depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with ComEd s
regulatory recovery method. ComEd s actual incurred removal costs are applied against the related regulatory liability. PECO s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense
over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO s regulatory recovery method.           See Note 5 Property, Plant and Equipment, Note 6 Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 19 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding property, plant and
equipment.             Nuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)    
        The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized and charged to fuel expense
using the unit-of-production method. The estimated cost of disposal of SNF is established per the Standard Waste Contract with the DOE and is expensed through fuel expense at one mill ($.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation. On-site SNF storage
costs are capitalized or expensed as incurred based upon the nature of the work performed. A portion of the storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a DOE (or government owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed.
            Nuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)    
        Costs associated with nuclear outages, including planned major
maintenance activities, are expensed to operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment in the period incurred.         
   New Site Development Costs (Exelon and Generation)          
  New site development costs represent the costs incurred in the assessment, design and construction of new power generating and transmission
facilities. Such costs are capitalized when management considers project completion to be likely, primarily based on management s determination that the project is economically and operationally feasible, management and/or the Board of
Directors have approved the project and have committed to a plan to develop it, and Exelon and Generation have received the required regulatory approvals or management believes the receipt of required regulatory approvals is probable. Upon
commencement of construction, these costs will be charged to construction work in progress. Capitalized development costs are charged to operating and maintenance expense when project completion is no longer probable. At December 31, 2010,
Exelon and Generation s capitalized development costs totaled approximately $20 million, which are included in Property, Plant and Equipment on Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs primarily include land
rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of certain Exelon Wind projects. At December 31, 2009, there were no significant costs capitalized related to new site development. Approximately $6 million, $23
million and $26 million of costs were expensed by Exelon and Generation for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily related to the possible construction of a new nuclear plant in Texas.   
         Capitalized Software Costs (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Costs incurred during the application development stage of software
projects that are developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the   
         186

expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives, pursuant to
regulatory approval or requirement. The following table presents net unamortized capitalized software costs and amortization of capitalized software costs by year:   
     
           Depreciation and Amortization (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Except for the amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant and equipment on
a straight-line basis using the composite method. ComEd s depreciation includes a provision for estimated removal costs as authorized by the ICC. The estimated service lives for ComEd and PECO are primarily based on the average service lives
from the most recent depreciation study for each respective company. The estimated service lives of the nuclear-fuel generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a 20-year license renewal extension of
the operating licenses (to the extent that such renewal has not yet been granted) for all of Generation s operating nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for information regarding
Oyster Creek. The estimated service lives of the hydroelectric generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which assume a license renewal extension of the operating licenses. The estimated service lives of the
fossil fuel and other renewable generating facilities are based on the remaining useful lives of the stations, which Generation periodically evaluates based on feasibility assessments taking into account economic and capital requirement
considerations. See Note 5 Property, Plant and Equipment for further information regarding depreciation.         
  Amortization of regulatory assets is recorded over the recovery period specified in the related legislation or regulatory agreement. See Notes
2 Regulatory Matters and 19 Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding Generation s nuclear fuel, Generation s ARC and the amortization of ComEd s and PECO s regulatory assets.   
         Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The authoritative guidance for accounting for AROs requires the
recognition of a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even though the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for
each of Generation s nuclear units at least every five years. Generation generally updates its ARO annually based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various
scenarios. The liabilities associated with Exelon s non-nuclear AROs are adjusted on an ongoing rotational basis, at least once every five years, due to the passage of new laws and regulations and revisions to either the timing or amount of
estimates of undiscounted cash flows and estimates of cost escalation factors. AROs are accreted each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to operating and
  
         187

maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations or, in the case of the majority of ComEd s and PECO s accretion, through an increase to regulatory assets. See Note
12 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.         
   Capitalized Interest and AFUDC (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  Exelon and Generation capitalize during construction the costs of debt funds used to finance non-regulated construction projects.   
        Exelon, ComEd and PECO apply the authoritative guidance for accounting
for certain types of regulation to calculate AFUDC, which is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded as a charge to construction work in
progress and as a non-cash credit to AFUDC that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by
regulatory authorities.            The following table summarizes
total cost incurred, capitalized interest and credits of AFUDC by year:         

(a)  
  Includes interest expense to affiliates.           
   Guarantees (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  The Registrants recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken in issuing
the guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur.         
  The liability that is initially recognized at the inception of the guarantee is reduced as the Registrants are released from risk under the
guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the
guarantee. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.             Asset Impairments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)               Long-Lived Assets.   Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and PECO evaluate the carrying value of their long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may
not be recoverable. See Note 5 Property, Plant and Equipment for a discussion of asset impairment evaluations made by Generation.   
         188

     Goodwill.   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that
could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 7 Intangible Assets for additional information regarding Exelon s and ComEd s goodwill.             Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions,
including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Additionally, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm
commitment (fair value hedge) or hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for both the
derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the cost or value of the underlying exposure is
deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For other derivative contracts that do not
qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. For energy-related derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, which are subject to Exelon s
Risk Management Policy, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in revenue, purchased power and fuel, or Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, depending on the underlying nature of the
Registrants  hedged items.            Revenues and expenses on
contracts that qualify, and are designated, as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be
recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. Normal purchases and normal sales are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period
of time and price is not tied to an unrelated underlying derivative. As part of Generation s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include
short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. If it were determined that a transaction designated as a normal
purchase or a normal sale no longer met the exceptions, the fair value of the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings at Generation or offset by a regulatory asset or liability at ComEd and
PECO. See Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.             Retirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Generation, ComEd and PECO participate in Exelon s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. AmerGen sponsored a separate defined benefit pension plan and postretirement plan for its
employees until the merger of AmerGen into Generation on January 8, 2009. Exelon became the sponsor of those plans at that date.

   The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans involve
various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes on pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations is generally recognized over the expected average remaining service period of the employees rather than immediately recognized in the income statement. See Note 13 Retirement Benefits for additional discussion of Exelon s
accounting for retirement benefits.             New Accounting Pronouncements
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Exelon has
identified the following new accounting pronouncements that have been recently adopted or issued that may affect the Registrants upon adoption.         
    Transfers of Financial Assets           
  In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance amending the accounting for the transfers of financial assets. Key provisions include
(i) the removal of the concept of qualifying special purpose entities, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a participating interest, in circumstances in which a portion of a financial asset has been transferred and (iii) the
requirement that to qualify for sale accounting, the transferor must evaluate whether it maintains effective control over transferred financial assets either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, this guidance required enhanced disclosures
about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement. This guidance was effective for the Registrants beginning January 1, 2010 and was required to be applied prospectively. See Note 10 Debt and Credit
Agreements for discussion regarding the application of this guidance as it relates to PECO s accounts receivable agreement.         
    Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities           
  In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for VIEs. The
model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously, variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a
controlling financial interest in a VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. In contrast, the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess whether it has
a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so, whether it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore, this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of
triggering events. This revised guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company s involvement with a VIE affects its financial statements and exposure to risks. This guidance became effective for the Registrants on
January 1, 2010. See further discussion of the Registrants  VIEs and the impact of adopting this new guidance above.         
    Fair Value Measurements Disclosures           
  In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance requires
entities to disclose significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels and the reasons for the transfers and to present information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value
measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Additionally, the guidance clarifies that   
         190   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

a reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using
significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). This guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases, sales,
issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. As this guidance provided only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard did not impact
the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial positions.              Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses Disclosures           
  In July 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring entities to disclose additional information about their allowance for uncollectible
accounts and the credit quality of their financing receivables, which include loans defined as a contractual right to receive money, on demand or on fixed or determinable dates, with terms exceeding one year. The additional disclosure requirements
include the nature of the credit risk inherent in their financing receivables balance, how the risk is analyzed and assessed in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and the changes and reasons for changes in the allowance for
uncollectible accounts. This guidance is applicable to PECO s long-term installment plan receivables and was effective for the Registrants on December 31, 2010. As this guidance provides only additional disclosure requirements, the
adoption of this standard did not impact the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position. See the discussion of the Registrants  allowance for uncollectible accounts policy above and Note 4 Accounts Receivable
for further information.              Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables              In October 2009, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist, and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those
separate deliverables. The guidance is expected to result in more multiple-deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance. This guidance was effective for the Registrants beginning on January 1, 2011 and is required to be
applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements. The Registrants have concluded that this guidance will not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   
          Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business
Combinations              In December 2010, the FASB issued
authoritative guidance amending the existing guidance for the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. The guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should
disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only, rolled forward through the current
period. Additionally, the guidance expands required supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination. This guidance
is effective for the Registrants beginning on January 1, 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations that are considered material on an individual or aggregated basis. As this guidance provides only additional
disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard will not impact the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

      2. Regulatory Matters (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The following matters below discuss, in all material respects, the
current status of regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.         
   Illinois Regulatory Matters          
    Appeal of 2007 Illinois Electric Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and ComEd).   The ICC issued an order in ComEd s 2007 electric
distribution rate case (2007 Rate Case) approving a $274 million increase in ComEd s annual delivery services revenue requirement, which became effective in September 2008. In the order, the ICC authorized a return on ComEd s distribution
rate base using a weighted average debt and equity return of 8.36%, an increase over the 8.01% return authorized in the previous rate case. ComEd and several other parties filed appeals of the rate order with the Illinois Appellate Court (Court).
The Court issued a decision on September 30, 2010, ruling against ComEd on the treatment of post-test year accumulated depreciation and the recovery of costs for an AMI/Customer Applications pilot program via a rider (Rider SMP). On
November 18, 2010, the Court denied ComEd s petition for rehearing in connection with the September 30, 2010 ruling. On January 25, 2011, ComEd filed a Petition for Leave to Appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.   
        The Court held the ICC abused its discretion in not reducing
ComEd s rate base to account for an additional 18 months of accumulated depreciation while including post test year pro forma plant additions through that period (the same position ComEd has taken in its 2010 electric distribution rate
case (2010 Rate Case) discussed below). The Court s ruling, absent reversal following further proceedings, may trigger a refund obligation. The ICC will ultimately be required to set a just and reasonable rate which will determine the amount of
any refund. The impact on ComEd s rates and any associated refund obligation should be prospective from no earlier than the date of the Court s ruling on September 30, 2010. ComEd will continue to bill rates as established under the
ICC s order in the 2007 Rate Case, but will recognize for accounting purposes its estimate of any refund obligation, subject to true up when the ICC establishes a new rate. An interest charge may accrue on any refund amount. ComEd recorded
an estimated refund obligation of $17 million as of December 31, 2010.            The Court also reversed the ICC s approval of ComEd s Rider SMP, a program which included the installation of 131,000 smart meters in the Chicago area. The Court held that the ICC s approval of Rider
SMP constituted illegal single issue ratemaking. The Court s decision prescribes a new, more stringent standard for cost recovery riders not specifically authorized by statute. Such riders would be allowed only if: (1) the
pass through cost is imposed by an  external circumstance  and is unexpected, volatile, or fluctuating; and (2) recovery via rider does not change other expenses or increase utility income. As a result of the Court s ruling
on Rider SMP, ComEd reclassified $6 million of regulatory assets to property, plant and equipment for costs to retire early meters replaced with smart meters during ComEd s AMI/Customer Applications pilot. This is consistent with the composite
method of depreciation and recovery of capitalized expenditures. ComEd also recorded a $4 million (pre tax) write off of regulatory assets associated with operating and maintenance costs that were originally allowable under Rider SMP, as
the costs can no longer be recovered from customers. ComEd does not believe any of its other riders are affected by the Court s ruling.         
  Subsequent to the Court s ruling, ComEd filed a request with the ICC to allow it to request recovery, through inclusion in the 2010 Rate Case,
of $3 million in operation and maintenance costs, as well as carrying costs associated with capital investment in the ICC-approved AMI/Customer Applications pilot program. The Rider SMP pilot program capital investment had already been
  
         192

requested in rate base in the 2010 Rate Case. On December 2, 2010, the ICC approved ComEd s request. The investment and the pilot program costs are subject to challenge in the 2010 Rate
Case proceeding.              2010 Illinois Electric Distribution
Rate Case (Exelon and ComEd).   On June 30, 2010, ComEd requested ICC approval for an increase of $396 million to its annual delivery services revenue requirement. On January 3, 2011, ComEd filed surrebuttal testimony which adjusted
ComEd s requested annual revenue requirement increase to $326 million to account for recent changes in tax law, corrections, acceptance of limited adjustments proposed by certain parties and the amounts expected to be recovered in the AMI pilot
program tariff discussed above. The request to increase the annual revenue requirement is to allow ComEd to continue modernizing its electric delivery system and recover the costs of substantial investments made since its last rate filing in 2007.
The requested increase also reflects increased costs, most notably pension and OPEB, since ComEd s rates were last determined. The requested rate of return on common equity is 11.5%. The requested increase in electric distribution rates would
increase the average residential customer s monthly electric bill by approximately 5%. In addition, ComEd is requesting future recovery of certain amounts that were previously recorded as expense. If that request is approved, ComEd would
reverse the previously expensed costs and establish regulatory assets with amortization over the period during which rate recovery is allowed. As a result, ComEd would recognize a one-time benefit of up to $39 million (pre-tax) to reverse the prior
charges. The requested increase also includes $22 million for increased uncollectible accounts expense. If the rate request is approved, the threshold for determining over/under recoveries under ComEd s uncollectible accounts tariff would be
increased by $22 million.            The Court s
September 30, 2010 ruling in connection with ComEd s 2007 Rate Case makes it highly unlikely that the ICC would decide the post-test year accumulated depreciation issue in ComEd s favor in the 2010 Rate Case. ComEd estimates that its
requested revenue requirement increase of $326 million could be reduced by approximately $85 million as a result of this adjustment. Certain parties have submitted testimony recommending significant reductions to ComEd s requested increase as
well as the write-off of certain assets, most notably the regulatory asset associated with severance costs, which was approximately $74 million as of December 31, 2010. Management believes the regulatory asset is appropriate based on the
ICC s orders in ComEd s last two rate cases. The new electric distribution rates are expected to take effect no later than June 2011. ComEd cannot predict how much of the requested electric distribution rate increase the ICC may approve.
             Illinois Legislation Authorizing Recovery of
Uncollectible Accounts (Exelon and ComEd).     In 2009, comprehensive legislation was enacted into law in Illinois providing public utility companies with the ability to recover from or refund to customers the difference between the
utility s annual uncollectible accounts expense and amounts collected in rates annually through a rider mechanism, starting with 2008 and prospectively. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order adopting ComEd s proposed tariffs
filed in accordance with the legislation, with minor modifications. As a result of that ICC order, ComEd recorded a regulatory asset of $70 million and an offsetting reduction in operating and maintenance expense in the first quarter of 2010 for the
cumulative under collections in 2008 and 2009. Recovery of the regulatory asset associated with 2008 and 2009 activities is over an approximate 14 month time frame, which began in April 2010. The recovery or refund of the difference in the
uncollectible accounts expense applicable to each year after 2009 is over a 12 month time frame beginning in June of the following year. In addition, ComEd recorded a one time charge of $10 million to operating and maintenance expense in
the first quarter of 2010 for a contribution to the Supplemental Low Income Energy Assistance Fund as required by the legislation. The fund is used to assist low income residential customers.

     Illinois Procurement Proceedings (Exelon, Generation and ComEd).   ComEd is
permitted to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers without mark-up. Beginning on January 1, 2007, ComEd procured all energy to meet its load service requirements through ICC-approved staggered SFCs with various
suppliers, including Generation. Since June 2009, under the Illinois Settlement Legislation, the IPA designs, and the ICC approves an electricity supply portfolio for ComEd and the IPA administers a competitive process under which ComEd procures its
electricity supply from various suppliers, including Generation. In order to fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ComEd hedged the price of a significant portion of energy purchased in the spot market with a five-year
variable-to-fixed financial swap contract with Generation that expires on May 31, 2013.            On December 28, 2009, the ICC approved the IPA s procurement plan covering the period June 2010 through May 2015. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd had completed the ICC-approved procurement process for
a portion of its energy requirements through May 2012. The remainder of ComEd s expected energy requirements through May 2012 will be met through additional Block Contracts resulting from future RFP processes or purchased through the spot
market and hedged by the financial swap contract with Generation.            The Illinois Settlement Legislation requires ComEd to purchase an increasing percentage of its electricity requirements from renewable energy resources. As of December 31, 2010, the ICC had approved the
results of ComEd s 2010 RFPs to procure RECs for the period from June 2010 through May 2011 and to procure long-term RECs for a 20 year period starting in June 2012. On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into 20-year contracts with several
unaffiliated suppliers regarding the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. The long term renewables purchased will count towards satisfying ComEd s obligation under the state s RPS and all associated costs will be
recoverable from customers.            On December 2, 2010, the
ICC approved ComEd s reconciliation of the actual costs of power purchased in the January 2007 through May 2008 period with the costs for power that flowed through ComEd s tariffs and were collected from customers. The ICC has initiated a
similar proceeding to reconcile the actual costs of power purchased in the June 2008 through May 2009 period. Because the Illinois Settlement Legislation has already deemed such costs to be prudently incurred, the reconciliation proceeding is not
expected to have a significant impact on ComEd.                 See Notes 9 Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information regarding ComEd s financial swap contract with Generation and long-term renewable energy contracts.   
          Illinois Settlement Legislation (Exelon, Generation and
ComEd     )    .    The Illinois Settlement Legislation was signed into law in August 2007 following a settlement resulting from extensive discussions with legislative leaders in Illinois, ComEd, Generation and
other utilities and generators in Illinois to address concerns about higher electric bills in Illinois without rate freeze, generation tax or other legislation that Exelon believes would be harmful to consumers of electricity, electric utilities,
generators of electricity and the State of Illinois. Various Illinois electric utilities, their affiliates and generators of electricity in Illinois agreed to contribute approximately $1 billion over a period of four years that ended in 2010 to
programs to provide rate relief to Illinois electricity customers and funding for the IPA. ComEd committed to issue $64 million in rate relief credits to customers or to fund various programs to assist customers. Generation committed to contribute
an aggregate of $747 million, consisting of $435 million to pay ComEd for rate relief programs for ComEd customers, $307.5 million for rate relief programs for customers of other Illinois utilities and $4.5 million for partially funding operations
of the IPA. The contributions were recognized in the financial statements of Generation and ComEd as rate relief credits were applied to customer bills by ComEd and other Illinois utilities or as

operating expenses associated with the programs were incurred. As of December 31, 2010, Generation and ComEd had fulfilled their commitments under the Illinois Settlement Legislation.
           During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, Generation and ComEd recognized net costs from their contributions pursuant to the Illinois Settlement Legislation in their Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:   

(a)  
  Recorded as a reduction in operating revenues.     

(b)  
  Recorded as a charge to operating and maintenance expense.           
    Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Resources (Exelon and ComEd).   As a result of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, electric
utilities in Illinois are required to include cost-effective energy efficiency resources in their plans to meet an incremental annual program energy savings requirement of 0.2% of energy delivered to retail customers for the year ended June 1,
2009, which increases annually to 2% of energy delivered in the year commencing June 1, 2015 and each year thereafter. Additionally, during the ten year period that began June 1, 2008, electric utilities must implement cost-effective
demand response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers. The energy efficiency and demand response goals are subject to rate impact caps each year. Utilities are allowed recovery of costs for energy
efficiency and demand response programs, subject to approval by the ICC. In February 2008, the ICC issued an order approving substantially all of ComEd s first three-year Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan, including cost recovery.
This plan began in June 2008 and goes through May 2011. In December 2010, the ICC approved ComEd s second three-year Efficiency and Demand Response Plan covering the period June 2011 through May 2014. The plans are designed to meet the Illinois
Settlement Legislation s energy efficiency and demand response goals through May 2014, including reductions in delivered energy to all retail customers and in the peak demand of eligible retail customers.

   Since June 1, 2008, utilities have been required to procure cost-effective renewable energy
resources in amounts that equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers. ComEd is also required to acquire amounts of renewable energy resources that will cumulatively increase this
percentage to at least 10% by June 1, 2015, with an ultimate target of at least 25% by June 1, 2025, subject to customer rate cap limitations. All goals are subject to rate impact criteria set forth in the Illinois Settlement Legislation.
As of December 31, 2010, ComEd had purchased sufficient renewable energy resources or equivalents, such as RECs, to comply with the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd currently retires all RECs immediately upon purchase. ComEd is permitted
to recover procurement costs of RECs from retail customers without mark-up through rates. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for information regarding ComEd s future commitments for the procurement of RECs.

          2010 Pennsylvania Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Rate
Cases (Exelon and PECO).   On March 31, 2010, PECO filed separate petitions before the PAPUC for increases of $316 million and $44 million to its annual service revenue requirement for electric and natural gas distribution, respectively,
to fund critical infrastructure improvement projects to meet customer demand and ensure the safe and reliable delivery of electricity and natural gas. Costs related to customer assistance discount programs are also included in the annual service
revenue requirement. These costs were previously transferred to Generation under the PPA, which expired on December 31, 2010. On December 16, 2010, the PAPUC approved the settlement of PECO s electric and natural gas distribution rate
cases for increases in annual service revenue of $225 million and $20 million, respectively. The settlements do not impact recoverability of PECO s regulatory assets currently recorded and the electric settlement provides for recovery of PJM
transmission service costs, on a full and current basis through a rider. The settlements include a stipulation regarding how expected tax benefits related to anticipated IRS guidance on repairs allowance deduction methodology are to be handled from
a rate-making perspective. The settlements require the expected cash benefit from the application of the new methodology to prior tax years be refunded to customers over a seven-year period. The prospective tax benefit claimed as a result of the new
methodology is to be reflected in tax expense in the year in which it is claimed on the tax return and will be reflected in the determination of revenue requirements in the next electric and natural gas distribution base rate cases. The approved
electric and natural gas distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2011.            The 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement did not specify the rate of return upon which the settlement rates are based, but rather provided for an increase in annual revenue. PECO s most recently
approved weighted average debt and equity return on electric rate base, which included electric transmission, distribution and generation, was 11.23% (approved in 1990). PECO has not filed a transmission rate case since rates have been unbundled.
PECO s purchased gas cost rates are not subject to caps and do not earn a return. The 2008 and 2010 natural gas distribution rate case settlements did not specify the rate of return upon which the settlement rates are based, but rather provided
for an increase in annual revenue.              2008 Pennsylvania
Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case (Exelon and PECO).   In October 2008, the PAPUC approved the settlement related to PECO s natural gas distribution rate case, which was filed in March 2008 providing an increase of $77 million
to its annual natural gas distribution revenue. As part of the settlement, PECO agreed to enhance its low-income programs as well as provide funding for new energy-efficiency programs to help customers manage their energy usage and gas bills. The
approved natural gas distribution rates became effective on January 1, 2009.

     Nuclear Decommissioning Funding (Exelon, Generation and PECO).   In 2009, the
PAPUC entered an order instituting an investigation into whether PECO s nuclear decommissioning cost adjustment clause (NDCAC), which is a rider that allows PECO to collect funds from customers for future decommissioning costs of seven former
PECO nuclear units now owned by Generation, should continue after December 31, 2010. During the course of the investigation, PECO and the interested parties reached an agreement, as set forth in a Stipulation and Joint Memorandum filed on
February 24, 2010 (Settlement) that PECO is entitled to recovery from customers through the NDCAC beyond December 31, 2010 for the funding of future decommissioning costs. The Settlement also contained a provision in which it was agreed
that PECO would not claim recovery under the NDCAC for any projected incremental physical decommissioning costs with respect to any former PECO nuclear unit as a result of an extension of that unit s NRC operating license. On July 15,
2010, the PAPUC approved the Settlement. See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.         
    Pennsylvania Procurement Proceedings (Exelon and PECO).     In 2009, the PAPUC approved PECO s DSP Program, under which
PECO will provide default electric service following the expiration of electric generation rate caps on December 31, 2010. The DSP Program, which has a 29-month term beginning January 1, 2011 and ending May 31, 2013, complies with
electric supply procurement guidelines set forth in Act 129. Under the DSP Program, PECO is permitted to recover its electric procurement costs from retail default service customers without mark-up through the GSA. The GSA provides for the recovery
of energy, capacity, ancillary costs and administrative costs and is subject to adjustments at least quarterly for any over or under collections. The filing and implementation costs of the DSP program have been recorded as a regulatory asset and are
recoverable through the GSA over its 29-month term. During 2010, PECO entered into contracts with PAPUC-approved bidders for its third and fourth competitive procurements of electric supply for default electric service commencing January 2011, which
included fixed price full requirement contracts for all procurement classes, spot market price full requirements contracts for the commercial and industrial procurement classes, and block energy contracts for the residential procurement class. Under
the full requirements contracts, default service suppliers must provide electric supply, capacity, transmission other than Network Integration Transmission Service, ancillary services, transmission and distribution losses, congestion management
costs and AECs for compliance with the AEPS Act. As of December 31, 2010, including the previous competitive procurements completed in 2009 and 2010, the 2011 expected energy requirements for all customer classes have been substantially
procured. PECO will conduct five additional competitive procurements over the remainder of the term of the DSP Program.         
  The hourly spot market priced full requirement tranches for large commercial and industrial default service customers in the September 2010
procurement were not fully subscribed. PECO intends to serve the associated load through direct purchases from the PJM spot market and separately procured AEPS credits, for the period beginning January 1, 2011 through May 31, 2011. PECO
will solicit bids for the unsubscribed hourly spot market price full requirements procurement tranches for its large commercial and industrial customer class in its next default service procurement occurring in May 2011.   
        As part of the 2009 settlement of the DSP Program, PECO filed a Revised
Electric Purchase of Receivables (POR) program that requires PECO to purchase the customer accounts receivable of EGSs that participate in the electric customer choice program and have elected consolidated billing by PECO. The Revised Electric POR
program was filed on November 20, 2009, and provided for full recovery of PECO s system implementation costs for program administration through a temporary discount on purchased receivables. On June 16, 2010, the PAPUC approved
PECO s settlement of the

electric POR program. The approved settlement states that PECO can terminate electric service to customers beginning January 1, 2011, based on unpaid charges for EGS service, and
uncollectible accounts expense will be recovered from customers through distribution rates. Receivables purchased under the POR program will be classified in other accounts receivable, net on Exelon and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets and
could significantly increase as a result of PECO s transition to market-based rates.              Smart Meter and Smart Grid Investments (Exelon and PECO).   In 2009, PECO filed a joint petition with the PAPUC for partial settlement of its $550 million Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan
to install more than 1.6 million smart meters and deploy advanced communication networks over a 15-year period. On April 22, 2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan that provides for recovery
through a rider for program expenses on a full and current basis and the accelerated depreciation incurred on existing meters due to early deployment over the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2020. The rider that provides
recovery of the costs of new meters placed in service includes a 10.5% equity return. PECO filed for PAPUC approval of an initial dynamic pricing and customer acceptance program in October 2010, and plans to file for approval of a universal meter
deployment plan for its remaining customers in 2012.            On
April 12, 2010, PECO entered into a Financial Assistance Agreement with the DOE for SGIG funds under the ARRA. Under the SGIG, PECO has been awarded $200 million, the maximum grant allowable under the program, for its SGIG project Smart
Future Greater Philadelphia. As a result of the SGIG funding, PECO will deploy 600,000 smart meters within three years, accelerate universal deployment of more than 1.6 million smart meters from 15 years to 10 years and increase smart grid
investments to approximately $100 million over the next three years. The $200 million SGIG funds will be reimbursed ratably based on projected spending of more than $400 million, which includes approximately $7 million related to demonstration
projects by two sub-recipients. The SGIG is non-taxable based on IRS guidance. The DOE has a conditional ownership interest in Federally-funded project property and equipment, which is subordinate to PECO s existing mortgage. In total, over the
next 10 years, PECO is planning to spend up to a total of $650 million on its smart grid and smart meter infrastructure. During 2010, PECO entered into agreements for an AMI network, AMI systems, installation of the first 600,000 meters, and
procurement of meters and fiber-cable. The $200 million SGIG from the DOE will be used to significantly reduce the impact of those investments on PECO ratepayers.   
        As of December 31, 2010, PECO has incurred project expenditures of
$34 million that are reimbursable from the DOE, which have been recorded in other accounts receivable, net on PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets.         
    Energy Efficiency Programs (Exelon and PECO).     Pursuant to Act 129 s EE C reduction targets, PECO filed its
EE C plan with the PAPUC and received partial approval in 2009. In February 2010, the PAPUC approved PECO s revisions to the EE C plan. The approved plan set forth how PECO will reduce electric consumption by at least 1% in its service
territory by May 31, 2011 from expected consumption for the period June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010 and by 3% by May 31, 2013. In accordance with Act 129, PECO also plans to reduce peak demand by a minimum of 4.5% of PECO s
annual system peak demand in the 100 hours of highest demand by May 31, 2013, measured against its peak demand during the period of June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008. If PECO fails to achieve the required reductions in consumption
within the stated deadlines, PECO will be subject to civil penalties of up to $20 million, which would not be recoverable from ratepayers. As of December 31, 2010, PECO has met the 1% consumption reduction target for 2011.

   The approved four-year plan, which began on June 1, 2009, totals more than $330 million and
includes a CFL program, weatherization programs, an energy efficiency appliance rebate and trade-in program, rebates and energy efficiency programs for non-profit, educational, governmental and business customers, customer incentives for energy
management programs and incentives to help customers reduce energy demand during peak periods. In September 2010, PECO filed revisions to the EE C Plan previously approved in February 2010 that included adjustments to certain incentive levels
and the addition of energy efficiency measures to the existing portfolio. These revisions do not impact the total spending under the approved EE C plan or timely cost recovery from ratepayers. On January 27, 2011, the PAPUC unanimously
approved PECO s EE C Plan revisions.         
    Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (Exelon and PECO).   In November 2004, Pennsylvania adopted the AEPS Act. The AEPS Act
mandated that beginning in 2011, following the expiration of PECO s rate cap transition period, certain percentages of electric energy sold to Pennsylvania retail electric customers shall be generated from certain alternative energy resources
as measured in AECs. The requirement for electric energy that must come from Tier I alternative energy resources (including solar, wind power, low-impact hydropower, geothermal energy, biologically derived methane gas, fuel cells, biomass energy,
coal mine methane and black liquor generated within Pennsylvania) ranges from approximately 3.5% to 8.0% and the requirement for Tier II alternative energy resources (including waste coal, demand-side management, large-scale hydropower, municipal
solid waste, generation of electricity utilizing by-products of the pulping process and wood, distributed generation systems and integrated combined coal gasification technology) ranges from 6.2% to 10.0%. The required compliance percentages
incrementally increase each PJM year until May 31, 2021. These Tier I and Tier II alternative energy resources include acceptable energy sources as set forth in Act 129 in addition to those outlined in the AEPS Act.   
        In 2007 and 2009, the PAPUC approved PECO s plan under which PECO
entered into five-year and ten-year agreements with accepted bidders, including Generation, totaling 452,000 non-solar and 8,000 solar Tier I AECs annually. The AECs procured prior to the 2011 compliance year were banked and are anticipated to be
used to meet AEPS obligations through May 2013. All administrative costs incurred in connection with AEC procurement prior to 2011 have been deferred as a regulatory asset with a return on the unamortized balance and will be recovered from customers
in 2011. Those costs, and PECO s AEPS Act compliance costs incurred thereafter, will be recovered from customers on a full and current basis through a rider as contemplated by the AEPS Act. In November 2010, PECO filed a petition with the PAPUC
for approval of procurement of Tier II AECs to satisfy PECO s compliance requirements for the AEPS reporting years ending 2011 and 2012.         
   Federal Regulatory Matters          
    Transmission Rate Case (Exelon and ComEd).     ComEd s transmission rates are established based on a FERC approved
formula. ComEd s formula transmission rate currently provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate base of 9.27%, a decrease from the 9.43% return previously authorized. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of
ComEd s 2007 transmission rate case, the rate of return on common equity is 11.5% and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the formula transmission rate is currently capped
at 56%. This equity cap will be reduced to 55% in June 2011.         
  ComEd s most recent annual formula rate update filed in May 2010 reflects actual 2009 expenses and investments plus forecasted 2010 capital
additions. The update resulted in a revenue requirement of $430 million offset by a $14 million reduction related to the true up of 2009 actual costs for a net   
         199

revenue requirement of $416 million. This compares to the May 2009 updated net revenue requirement of $440 million. The decrease in the revenue requirement was primarily driven by ComEd s
2009 cost savings measures. The 2010 net revenue requirement became effective June 1, 2010 and is recovered over the period extending through May 31, 2011. The regulatory liability associated with the true up is being amortized as the
associated amounts are refunded.              PJM Transmission
Rate Design (Exelon, ComEd and PECO).   PJM Transmission Rate Design specifies the rates for transmission service charged to customers within PJM. Currently, ComEd and PECO incur costs based on the existing rate design, which charges
customers based on the cost of the existing transmission facilities within their load zone and the cost of new transmission facilities based on those who benefit. In April 2007, FERC issued an order concluding that PJM s current rate design for
existing facilities is just and reasonable and should not be changed. In the same order, FERC held that the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above should be socialized across the entire PJM footprint and that the costs of new facilities less than
500 kV should be allocated to the customers of the new facilities who caused the need for those facilities. In the short term, based on new transmission facilities approved by PJM, it is likely that allocating across PJM the costs of new facilities
500 kV and above will increase charges to ComEd and reduce charges to PECO, as compared to the allocation methodology in effect before the FERC order. After FERC ultimately denied all requests for rehearing on all issues, several parties filed
petitions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for review of the decision. On August 6, 2009, the court issued its decision affirming FERC s order with regard to the costs of existing facilities but reversing and remanding
to FERC for further consideration its decision with regard to the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above. On January 21, 2010, FERC issued an order establishing paper hearing procedures to supplement the record. In May and June 2010, certain
parties, including Exelon, submitted testimony to supplement the record. ComEd anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes effective after December 31, 2006 should be recoverable through retail rates and, thus, the rate design
changes are not expected to have a material impact on ComEd s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. PECO anticipates that all impacts of any rate design changes should be recoverable through the transmission service charge
rider approved in PECO s 2010 electric distribution rate case settlement and, thus, the rate design changes are not expected to have a material impact on PECO s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. To the extent any
rate design changes are retroactive to periods prior to January 1, 2011 there may be an impact on PECO s results of operation.         
    Market-Based Rates (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).     Generation, ComEd and PECO are public utilities for purposes of
the Federal Power Act and are required to obtain FERC s acceptance of rate schedules for wholesale electricity sales. Currently, Generation, ComEd and PECO have authority to execute wholesale electricity sales at market-based rates. As is
customary with market-based rate schedules, FERC has reserved the right to suspend market-based rate authority on a retroactive basis if it subsequently determines that Generation, ComEd or PECO has violated the terms and conditions of its tariff or
the Federal Power Act. FERC is also authorized to order refunds if it finds that the market-based rates are not just and reasonable under the Federal Power Act.         
  As required by FERC s regulations, as promulgated in the Order No. 697 series, Generation, ComEd and PECO have filed market power analyses
using the prescribed market share screens to demonstrate that Generation, ComEd and PECO qualify for market-based rates in the regions where they are selling energy and capacity under market-based rate tariffs. FERC accepted the 2008 filings on
January 15, 2009 and September 2, 2009 and accepted the 2009 filing on October 26, 2009, affirming Exelon s affiliates continued right to make sales at market-based rates. These analyses must examine historic test period data and
must be updated every three years on a prescribed schedule.

The most recent updated analysis for the PJM and Northeast Regions was filed in late 2010, based on 2009 historic test period data. In that updated analysis, Generation informed FERC that its
market share data in PJM would change beginning in 2011, when Generation s contract for PECO s full requirements for capacity and energy expired. That change, as well as any new sales contracts or other intervening changes in
Generation s market share, will be reflected in the next updated market share screen analysis due to be filed at the end of 2013. In the meantime, under FERC s rules and precedent, any market power concerns would be obviated by
FERC-approved RTO market monitoring and mitigation program in PJM.              Reliability Pricing Model (Exelon and Generation).   On December 22, 2006, FERC approved a contested settlement establishing a competitive auction mechanism for forward sales of capacity to
serve PJM s capacity requirements. The settlement provided for an auction 36 months in advance of each delivery year beginning with the delivery year ending May 31, 2012 and an expedited phase-in process for four
transitional auctions covering delivery years ending on May 31 in 2008 through 2011. All but one appeal of FERC s order approving RPM were withdrawn on February 27, 2009 and the remaining appeal was denied by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) on March 17, 2009.            PJM s transitional RPM auctions took place 36 months ahead of the scheduled delivery year. The most recent auction for the delivery year ending May 31, 2014 occurred in May 2010. Thus far, the
RPM capacity auctions have secured capacity for the PJM market through 2014. While auction results produced varying prices, as anticipated, the RPM has been beneficial for owners of generation facilities, particularly for such facilities located in
constrained zones, as compared to the prior capacity-payment construct.            On May 30, 2008, a group of PJM load-serving entities, state commissions, consumer advocates and trade associations (referred to collectively as the RPM Buyers) filed a complaint at FERC against PJM alleging
that three of the four transitional RPM auctions yielded prices that are unjust and unreasonable under the Federal Power Act. Most of the parties comprising the RPM Buyers group were parties to the settlement approved by FERC that
established the RPM. In the complaint, the RPM Buyers requested that the total projected payments to RPM sellers for the three auctions at issue be materially reduced. The FERC s dismissal of the complaint was appealed to the D.C.
Circuit. On February 8, 2011, the D.C. Circuit denied the petition for review. While the RPM Buyers may file for rehearing of this decision and/or appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court, the likelihood of reversal is minimal. Therefore, Exelon and
Generation believe that it is remote that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse impact on their respective results of operations, cash flows or financial position.              License Renewals (Exelon and Generation).   On April 8, 2009, the NRC issued a renewed operating
license for Oyster Creek that expires in April 2029. On December 8, 2010, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies
for additional information.            On October 22, 2009, the
NRC issued a renewed operating license for TMI Unit 1 that expires in April 2034.            On August 18, 2009, PSEG submitted an application to the NRC to extend the operating license of Salem Units 1 and 2 by 20 years. Exelon is part owner of the Salem Units. The NRC is expected to spend a total of
22 to 30 months to review the application before making a decision. The current operating licenses expire in 2016 and 2020, respectively.

    Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)    
        Exelon, ComEd and PECO prepare their consolidated financial statements
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation. Under this guidance, regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through
regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in
advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.         
  The following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of Exelon, ComEd and PECO as of December 31, 2010 and
2009.

Competitive transition
charges   .  These charges represent PECO s stranded costs that the PAPUC determined would be recoverable under the Competition Act through electric generation rates, which included a 10.75% return on the unamortized balance, over
the transition period. These costs were related to generation assets that would no longer be recoverable through regulated rates due to the deregulation of the generation portion of the electric utility business in Pennsylvania. These charges were
fully amortized as of December 31, 2010, which coincided with the end of the transition period.         
    Pension and other postretirement benefits.   As of December 31, 2010, $2,750 million represents regulatory assets related to the
recognition of ComEd s and PECO s respective shares of the underfunded status of Exelon s defined benefit postretirement plans as a liability on Exelon s balance sheet. The regulatory asset is amortized in proportion to the
recognition of prior service costs (gains), transition obligations and actuarial losses attributable to ComEd s pension plan and ComEd s and PECO s other postretirement benefit plans determined by the cost recognition provisions of
the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits. ComEd and PECO will recover these costs through base rates as allowed in their most recently approved regulated rate orders. See Note 13 Retirement Benefits for additional
detail. In addition, $13 million is the result of PECO transitioning to the current authoritative guidance in 1993, which is recoverable in rates through 2012. ComEd and PECO are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs in base rates.

     Deferred income taxes.   These costs represent the difference between the method by
which the regulator allows for the recovery of income taxes and how income taxes would be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets and liabilities associated with deferred income taxes, recorded in compliance with the authoritative guidance for
accounting for certain types of regulation and income taxes, include the deferred tax effects associated principally with liberalized depreciation accounted for in accordance with the ratemaking policies of the ICC and PAPUC, as well as the revenue
impacts thereon, and assume continued recovery of these costs in future transmission and distribution rates. See Note 11 Income Taxes for additional information. ComEd and PECO are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs.
             Smart meter program expenses.   These costs
represent accelerated depreciation, filing and implementation costs relating to PECO s PAPUC approved Smart Meter Procurement and Installation Plan. The approved plan allows for recovery of filing and implementation costs incurred through
December 31, 2010 during 2011 and 2012. In addition, the approved plan provides for recovery of program costs beginning in January 2011 on full and current basis, which includes interest income or expense of 6% on the under or over recovery,
and recovery of accelerated depreciation on PECO s current meter reading assets over a 10 year period ending December 31, 2020. To the extent that PECO deploys smart meters sooner than required to replace existing meters and meter
communication modules, it will incur accelerated depreciation on these existing meters and modules.              Debt costs.   Consistent with rate recovery for ratemaking purposes, ComEd s and PECO s recoverable losses on reacquired long-term debt related to regulated operations are deferred and
amortized to interest expense over the life of the new debt issued to finance the debt redemption or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not refinanced. Interest-rate swap settlements are deferred and amortized over the period
that the related debt is outstanding or the life of the original issuance retired. These debt costs are used in the determination of the weighted cost of capital applied to rate base in the rate-making process.   
          Severance.   These costs represent previously incurred
severance costs that ComEd was granted recovery of in the December 20, 2006 ICC rehearing rate order. The recovery period is through June 30, 2014. ComEd is not earning a return on these costs.   
          Asset retirement obligations.   These costs represent
future removal costs associated with ComEd s and PECO s existing asset retirement obligations. PECO will begin to earn a return on, and a recovery of, these costs once the removal activities have been performed. ComEd will recover these
costs through future depreciation expense and will earn a return on these costs once the removal activities have been performed. See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.   
          MGP remediation costs.   Recovery of these items was
granted to ComEd in the July 26, 2006 ICC rate order. For PECO, these costs are recoverable through rates as prescribed in the 2008 and 2010 approved natural gas distribution rate case settlements. The period of recovery for both ComEd and PECO
will depend on the timing of the actual expenditures. ComEd and PECO are not earning a return on the recovery of these costs. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.   
          RTO start-up costs.   Recovery of these RTO start-up costs
was approved by FERC. The recovery period is through March 31, 2015. ComEd is earning a return on these costs.         
    Under-recovered uncollectible accounts.   As a result of the February 2010 ICC order approving recovery of ComEd s uncollectible
accounts, ComEd has the ability to adjust its rates annually to reflect

the increases and decreases in annual uncollectible accounts expense starting with year 2008. ComEd recorded a regulatory asset for the cumulative under-collections in 2008 and 2009. Recovery of
the initial regulatory asset will take place over an approximate 14-month time frame which began in April 2010. The recovery or refund of the difference in the uncollectible accounts expense applicable to the years starting with January 1,
2010, will take place over a 12 month time frame beginning in June of the following year. ComEd is not earning a return on these costs.         
    Financial swap with Generation.   To fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ComEd entered into a five-year
financial swap contract with Generation that expires on May 31, 2013. Since the swap contract was deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation, ensuring ComEd of full recovery in rates, the changes in fair value each period are
recorded by ComEd as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd does not earn (pay) a return on the regulatory asset (liability). The basis for the mark-to-market derivative asset or liability position is based on the difference
between ComEd s cost to purchase energy on the spot market and the contracted price. In Exelon s consolidated financial statements, the fair value of the intercompany swap recorded by Generation and ComEd is eliminated.   
          Rate case costs.   The ICC generally allows ComEd to
receive recovery of rate case costs over three years. The ICC has issued orders allowing recovery of these costs on July 26, 2006 and September 10, 2008. The recovery period is through September 15, 2011. Pursuant to the approved
settlement of the 2010 electric distribution rate case, PECO is allowed recovery of rate case costs over two years ending December 31, 2012. Pursuant to the approved settlements of the 2010 and 2008 natural gas distribution rate cases, PECO is
allowed recovery of rate case costs over two years ending December 31, 2012 and 2010, respectively. ComEd and PECO do not earn a return on the recovery of these costs.   
          DSP Program electric procurement contracts.   These amounts
represent an offset to the mark-to-market liability position of PECO s procurement contracts for electric supply following the expiration of its generation rate caps on December 31, 2010. Recovery of electric procurement costs through the
GSA, adjusted quarterly, was granted to PECO in the PAPUC approval of their DSP Program and will begin in 2011. This regulatory asset will be unwound against the mark-to-market liability over the relevant contract period beginning January 1,
2011 therefore, no return is earned.              DSP Program
costs    .   These amounts represent administrative costs incurred relating to filing, procurement, and information technology improvements associated with the procurement of electric supply following the expiration of PECO s
generation rate caps on December 31, 2010. Recovery of these costs was granted to PECO in the PAPUC approval of their DSP Program. The filing and implementation costs of the DSP Program are recoverable through the GSA over a 29-month period
beginning January 1, 2011. The independent evaluator costs associated with conducting procurements is recoverable over a 12-month period beginning January 1, 2011. Costs relating to information technology improvements will be recovered
over a 5-year period beginning January 1, 2011. PECO earns a 6% return on the recovery of information technology costs.         
    Under (over)-recovered energy and transmission costs current asset (liability).   Starting in 2007, ComEd energy and transmission costs
are recoverable (refundable) under ComEd s ICC and/or FERC-approved rates. ComEd s deferred energy and transmission costs are earning (paying) a rate of return. The PECO costs represent gas supply related costs recoverable (refundable)
under PECO s PAPUC-approved rates. PECO earns interest of 6% on the under-recovered energy costs and pays interest of 8% on over-recovered energy costs to customers.

     Nuclear decommissioning.   These amounts represent future nuclear decommissioning
costs that exceed (regulatory asset) or are less than (regulatory liability) the associated decommissioning trust fund assets. Exelon believes the trust fund assets, including prospective earnings thereon and any future collections from customers,
will equal the associated future decommissioning costs at the time of decommissioning. See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.         
    Removal costs.   These amounts represent funds ComEd has received from customers to cover the future removal of property, plant and
equipment which reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes.         
    Refund of PURTA taxes.   In October 2009, PECO prevailed in a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court case in which PECO had contested the
assessment of a PURTA supplemental tax applicable to 1997. As a result, PECO will receive approximately $4 million of previously remitted real estate taxes in 2011 and must pass this refund on to customers. PECO will begin amortizing this regulatory
liability and refunding the amount to customers in January 2011. No interest or return will be paid to customers.         
    Energy efficiency and demand response programs.   These amounts represent costs recoverable (refundable) under ComEd s ICC approved
Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Plan and PECO s PAPUC approved EE C Plan. ComEd began recovering these costs or refunding over-collections of these costs on June 1, 2008 through a rider. ComEd earns a return on the capital
investment incurred under the program but does not earn (pay) a return on under (over) collections. PECO began recovering these costs through a rider on full and current basis on January 1, 2010. Recovery will continue over the life of the
program, which expires on May 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, PECO s revenues related to the EE C exceeded program spend.         
   Operating and Maintenance for Regulatory Required Programs (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)    
        The following tables set forth costs for various legislative and/or
regulatory programs that are recoverable from customers on a full and current basis through a rider for ComEd and PECO for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. An equal and offsetting amount has been reflected in operating revenues
during the periods.

     3. Acquisition (Exelon and Generation)    
        On December 9, 2010, Generation completed the acquisition of all
of the equity interests of John Deere Renewables, LLC (now known as Exelon Wind), a leading operator and developer of wind power. Under the terms of the agreement, Generation acquired 735 MWs of installed, operating wind capacity located in eight
states. The acquisition builds on the Exelon s commitment to renewable energy as part of Exelon 2020, a business and environmental strategy to eliminate the equivalent of Exelon s 2001 carbon footprint.   
        The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
determined based upon the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions used include: projected future cash flows (including timing); discount rates reflecting the
risk inherent in the future cash flows; and future market prices. There were also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and the duration of the liabilities assumed. Generation did not record
any goodwill related to the acquisition of Exelon Wind.            The
following table summarizes the fair value of consideration transferred to acquire Exelon Wind and the value of identified assets and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:

   The contingent consideration arrangement requires that Generation pay up to $40 million related to
three individual projects with a capacity of 230 MWs, which are currently in advanced stages of development, upon meeting certain contractual commitments related to the commencement of construction of each project. The fair value of the contingent
consideration arrangement of $32 million was determined based upon a weighted average probability of meeting certain contractual commitments related to the commencement of construction of each project, which is considered an unobservable (Level 3)
input pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2010, the amount recognized for the contingent consideration arrangement, the range of outcomes, and the assumptions used to develop the estimate had not changed since the
December 9, 2010 acquisition date. Generation anticipates paying a portion of the contingent consideration within the next 12 months, and accordingly, has recorded $16 million of contingent consideration in other current liabilities within
Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining amount was recorded in other deferred credits and other liabilities within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
        The fair value of the assets acquired includes customer receivables of
$24 million, which represent all amounts due under the related contracts as of the acquisition date. Generation expects these receivables to be collected in the normal course of business. Generation did not acquire any other receivables as part of
the Exelon Wind acquisition.            The $3 million noncontrolling
interest represents the noncontrolling members  proportionate share in the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction.         
  Exelon Wind s revenue and operating income contribution to Exelon and Generation for the period from December 10, 2010 to
December 31, 2010 was not material. The unaudited pro forma results for Exelon and Generation as if the Exelon Wind acquisition occurred on January 1, 2009 were not materially different from Exelon and Generation s financial results
for years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.            In 2010, Exelon and Generation incurred $11 million of acquisition-related costs associated with this transaction. These costs are included within operating and maintenance expense in Exelon and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.         
     4. Accounts Receivable (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        Accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 and 2009 included
estimated unbilled revenues, representing an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy or services provided to customers, and is net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as follows:         

(a)  
  Includes an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $19 million related to PECO s installment plan receivables described below.     
         208

     PECO Installment Plan Receivables (Exelon and PECO).   PECO enters into payment
agreements with certain delinquent customers, primarily residential, seeking to restore their service, as required by the PAPUC. Customers with past due balances that meet certain income criteria are provided the option to enter into an installment
payment plan, some of which have terms greater than one year, to repay past due balances in addition to paying for their ongoing service on a current basis. The receivable balance for these payment agreement receivables is recorded in accounts
receivable for the current portion and other deferred debits and other assets for the noncurrent portion. The receivables balance for installment plans with terms greater than one year was $22 million, net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts
of $19 million as of December 31, 2010. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reserve methodology and assessment of the credit quality of the installment plan receivables are consistent with the customer accounts receivable methodology
discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The allowance for uncollectible accounts balance at December 31, 2010 of $19 million consists of $1 million, $5 million and $13 million for low risk, medium risk and high risk segments,
respectively. The balance of the payment agreement is billed to the customer in equal monthly installments over the term of the agreement. Installment receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2010 include balances not yet presented on the
customer bill, accounts currently billed and an immaterial amount of past due receivables. When a customer defaults under the payment agreement, the terms of which are defined by plan type, the entire balance under the agreement becomes due and the
balance is reclassified to current customer accounts receivable and reserved for in accordance with the methodology discussed in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.   
          Accounts Receivable Agreement (Exelon and PECO).   PECO is
party to an agreement with a financial institution under which it sold an undivided interest, adjusted daily, in up to $225 million of designated accounts receivable which is accounted for as a secured borrowing. As of December 31, 2010, the
financial institution s undivided interest in Exelon and PECO s gross accounts receivable was equivalent to $346 million, which is calculated under the terms of the agreement. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional
information regarding the accounts receivable agreement.

   The annual depreciation provisions as a percentage of average service life for electric generation
assets were 2.86%, 2.28% and 2.02% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.         
    License Renewals.   Generation s depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of its generating stations, which
assume the renewal of the licenses for all nuclear generating stations except for Oyster Creek. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding Oyster Creek. As a result, the receipt of license renewals has no
impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding license renewals.         
    Long-Lived Asset Impairments.   Due to the continued decline in forward energy prices in the first quarter of 2009, Generation evaluated
its Texas plants for recoverability as of March 31, 2009. As the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of the Handley and Mountain Creek stations were less than the stations  carrying values, the stations were determined
to be impaired at March 31, 2009. LaPorte station was determined not to be impaired. Accordingly, the Handley and Mountain Creek stations were written down to fair value, and an impairment charge of $223 million was recorded in operating
and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the first quarter of 2009. The fair value of the stations was determined using the income (discounted cash flow), market (available comparables)
and cost (replacement cost) valuation approaches.             ComEd

      6. Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant (Exelon, Generation and PECO)
            Exelon s, Generation s and PECO s
undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Generation also owns a proportionate share in the fossil fuel combustion turbine at Salem, which is fully depreciated. The gross book value was $3 million at December 31,
2010 and 2009.     

(d)  
  Generation has a 44.24% ownership interest in Merrill Creek Reservoir located in New Jersey.     
        Exelon s, Generation s and PECO s undivided ownership
interests are financed with their funds and all operations are accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly owned facilities. Exelon s, Generation s and PECO s share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are
included in fuel and operating and maintenance expenses on Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and in operating and maintenance expenses on PECO s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

        Exelon s and ComEd s gross amount of goodwill, accumulated
impairment losses and carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:         

(a)  
  Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom merger net of amortization, resolution of tax matters and other non-impairment-related changes as allowed under previous
authoritative guidance.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The impairment assessment is performed using a two-step, fair value based test. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation in
order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense.   
        Exelon assesses goodwill impairment at its ComEd reporting unit.
Accordingly, any goodwill impairment charge at ComEd will affect Exelon s consolidated results of operations. As a result of new authoritative guidance for fair value measurement effective January 1, 2009, Exelon and ComEd now estimate the
fair value of the ComEd reporting unit using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis instead of the expected cash flow approach used in 2008 and prior years. The discounted cash flow analysis relies
on a single scenario reflecting  base case  or  best estimate  projected cash flows for ComEd s business and includes an estimate of ComEd s terminal value based on these expected cash flows using the generally accepted
Gordon Dividend Growth formula, which derives a valuation using an assumed perpetual annuity based on the entity s residual cash flows. The discount rate is based on the generally accepted Capital Asset Pricing Model and represents the weighted
average cost of capital of comparable companies. The market multiples analysis utilizes multiples of business enterprise value to earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of comparable companies in estimating fair
value. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, operating and capital expenditure requirements and the fair value of debt. Management performs a
reconciliation of the sum of the estimated fair value of all Exelon reporting units to Exelon s enterprise value based on its trading price to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow analysis and the market multiple analysis.
             2010 Annual Goodwill Impairment Assessment.  
The 2010 annual goodwill impairment assessment was performed as of November 1, 2010. The first step of the annual impairment analysis, comparing the fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of
goodwill, therefore the second step was not required. Although the fair value of the reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value, adverse regulatory actions that could reduce ComEd s allowed long-term rate of return on common equity or
a fully successful IRS challenge to Exelon s and ComEd s like-kind exchange income tax position could potentially result in a future impairment loss of ComEd s goodwill, which could be material. In addition, deterioration in market
related factors used in the impairment review discussed above could also potentially cause a future impairment loss.         
    Prior Goodwill Impairment Assessments.   The 2009 and 2008 annual goodwill impairment assessments were performed as of November 1,
2009 and November 1, 2008, respectively. In each case, the first step of the annual impairment analysis, comparing the fair value of ComEd to its carrying value, including goodwill, indicated no impairment of goodwill, therefore the second step
was not required.

    Other Intangible Assets    
        Exelon s, Generation s and ComEd s other intangible
assets, included in deferred debits and other assets in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2010:         

(a)  
  Refer to Note 3 Acquisition for additional information regarding Exelon Wind.     

(b)  
  In March 1999, ComEd entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Chicago associated with ComEd s franchise agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, ComEd
agreed to make payments to the City of Chicago each year from 1999 to 2002. The intangible asset recognized as a result of these payments is being amortized ratably over the remaining term of the franchise agreement, which ends in 2020.

(c)  
  In February 2003, ComEd entered into separate agreements with the City of Chicago and with Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation). Under the terms of the settlement
agreement with the City of Chicago, ComEd agreed to pay the City of Chicago a total of $60 million over a ten-year period, beginning in 2003. The intangible asset recognized as a result of the settlement agreement is being amortized ratably over the
remaining term of the City of Chicago franchise agreement, which ends in 2020. As required by the settlement, ComEd also made a payment of $2 million to a third party on the City of Chicago s behalf.     

Pursuant to the agreement discussed above, ComEd received payments of $32 million from Midwest Generation to relieve Midwest Generation s obligation under the 1999 fossil
sale agreement with ComEd to build the generation facility in the City of Chicago. The payments received by ComEd, which have been recorded in other long-term liabilities, are being recognized ratably (approximately $2 million annually) as an offset
to amortization expense over the remaining term of the franchise agreement.              The following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:         
            John Deere Renewables.   Accounting guidance requires that the acquirer must recognize separately identifiable intangible assets in the application of purchase accounting. The output of the acquired
wind turbines has been sold under PPA contracts. The excess of the contract price of the PPAs over market prices was recognized as intangible assets. Generation determined that the estimated acquisition-date fair value of the intangible assets was
approximately $224 million, which was recorded in other deferred debits and other assets within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in this amount is $48 million related to the PPAs for the projects that are in the
advanced stage of development. While Generation expects to perform under the PPAs once the construction of these projects is complete, there is a risk of impairment if the projects do not reach commercial operation. The valuation of the
acquired intangible assets was estimated by applying the income approach, which is based upon discounted projected future cash flows associated with the PPA contracts. That measure is based upon certain unobservable inputs, which are considered
Level 3

inputs, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Key assumptions include forecasted power prices and discount rate. The intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis
over the period in which the associated contract revenues are recognized. Generation determined that the unit of production amortization method would best reflect when the intangible assets  economic benefits would be consumed; however, the
straight-line method approximates the equivalent of the unit of production method on an annual basis. The amortization expense will be reflected as a decrease in operating revenue within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income. The weighted-average amortization period for these intangibles is approximately 18 years.             
    Renewable Energy Credits and Alternative Energy Credits (Exelon, Generation and PECO).     Exelon s, Generation s,
and PECO s other intangible assets, included in other current assets and other deferred debits and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, include RECs (Exelon and Generation) and AECs (PECO). As of December 31, 2010, PECO had
current and noncurrent AECs of $10 million and $11 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, PECO had noncurrent AECs of $13 million. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the balances of RECs for Generation, which are
considered noncurrent, were $8 million and $6 million, respectively. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters and Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on RECs and AECs.   
           8. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)              Non-Derivative
Financial Assets and Liabilities.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Registrants  carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are representative of fair value because
of the short-term nature of these instruments.              Fair
Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at the Carrying Amount               Exelon          
    The carrying amounts and fair values of Exelon s long-term debt and SNF obligation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as
follows:            
          Fair values of long-term debt are determined by a valuation model, which is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. The fair value of
preferred securities of subsidiaries is determined using observable market prices as these securities are actively traded. The carrying amount of Exelon s and Generation s SNF obligation resulted from a contract with the DOE to provide for
disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating stations. Exelon s and Generation s obligation to the DOE accrues at the 13-week Treasury rate and fair value was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the obligation at
the

Generation s credit risk).             Generation
            The carrying amounts and fair values of
Generation s long-term debt and SNF obligation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:         
           ComEd             The

           PECO             The
carrying amounts and fair values of PECO s long-term debt and preferred securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:         
            Recurring Fair Value Measurements              To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, the FASB established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as
follows:         

Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to access as of the reporting
date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds.      

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
corroboration with observable market      
         217

data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, commingled investment funds priced at NAV per fund share and fair
value hedges.            

Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or
liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives.            
  There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. See Note 13 Retirement
Benefits for further information regarding the fair value and related valuation techniques for pension and postretirement plan assets.         
   Exelon          
  The following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring

     Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value     
        The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the
fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.             Cash Equivalents (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).  The Registrants  cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The cash equivalents shown in
the fair value tables are comprised of investments in mutual and money market funds. The fair values of the shares of these funds are based on observable market prices and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
            Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments and
Pledged Assets for Zion Station Decommissioning (Exelon and Generation).  The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Exelon s and Generation s nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT
funds hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds. Generation s investment policies place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the trusts. Assets
pledged for Zion Station decommissioning are not controlled by Generation and as a result, its investment activities are not subject to Generation s policies. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain
short-term fixed income securities, are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.         
  With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds
from market exchanges, which Generation is able to independently corroborate. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. Equity securities held
individually are primarily traded on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-Global Select Market, which contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges.   
        For fixed income securities, multiple prices from pricing services are
obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security. The trustees
monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is
considered to be preferable. Generation has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Generation selectively corroborates the fair
values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. U.S. Treasury securities are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of fixed income securities, excluding U.S.
Treasury securities, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2.   
        Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by
investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The fair values of short-term commingled funds held within the trust funds, which generally hold short-term fixed income securities and are not
subject to restrictions regarding the purchase or sale of shares, are derived from observable prices. The objectives of the remaining commingled funds in which Exelon and Generation

invest primarily seek to track the performance of certain equity indices by purchasing equity securities to replicate the capitalization and characteristics of the indices. In general, equity
commingled funds are redeemable on the 15th of the month and the last business day of the month; however, the fund manager may designate any day as a valuation date for the purpose of purchasing or redeeming units. Effective December 31, 2009,
commingled funds are categorized in Level 2 because the fair value of the funds are based on NAVs per fund share (the unit of account), primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying equity securities. See Note
12 Asset Retirement Obligations for further discussion on the NDT fund investments.             Rabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).  The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of
Exelon s executive management and directors. The investments in the Rabbi trusts are included in investments in the Registrants  Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of the shares of the funds are based on observable market prices
and, therefore, have been categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.             Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO) .   Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain non-exchange-based derivatives are valued using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges
and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are
reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract
duration. The remainder of non-exchange-based derivative contracts is valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market
parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model
inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants  non-exchange-based derivatives are predominately at liquid trading points. For non-exchange-based derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with
limited pricing information, such as the financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid
trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire
valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the
assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs
generally are not observable. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 1, 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of credit and
nonperformance risk by counterparty. The impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements. Transfers in and out of levels are recognized as of the beginning of the month the transfer occurred. Given derivatives
categorized within

Level 1 are valued using exchange-based quoted prices within observable periods, transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 generally do not occur. Transfers in and out of Level 2 and Level 3
generally occur when the contract tenure becomes more observable.            Exelon may utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percent of total debt. In addition,
the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon uses a calculation of future cash
inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and
market parameters such as interest rates and volatility. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9 Derivative
Financial Instruments for further discussion on mark-to-market derivatives.             Deferred Compensation Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO).  The Registrants  deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment
account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants  deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants 
notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices. However, since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they
are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.         
   Servicing Liability (Exelon and PECO).  PECO is party to an agreement with a financial institution under which it transferred an
undivided interest, adjusted daily, in customer accounts receivables designated under the agreement in exchange for proceeds of $225 million, which PECO accounted for as a sale under previous guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets.
A servicing liability was recorded for the agreement in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance for servicing of financial assets. The servicing liability was included in other current liabilities in Exelon s and PECO s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the liability was determined using internal estimates based on provisions in the agreement, which were categorized as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The servicing liability was released in
accordance with new guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets that was adopted on January 1, 2010. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.               9. Derivative Financial Instruments (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        The Registrants are exposed to certain risks related to ongoing
business operations. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Exposure to interest rate risk exists as a result of the issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, commercial paper and
commitment fees under credit facilities. To the extent the amount of energy Exelon generates differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, the Registrants are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels,
and other commodities. The Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations by entering into physical contracts as well as financial derivative contracts including swaps, futures,
forwards, options and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are classified as either economic hedges or non-derivatives, mitigate exposure to
fluctuations in commodity prices.   
         231   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   Derivative accounting guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets
or liabilities at fair value. Under these provisions, economic hedges are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception. The Registrants have applied the normal
purchases and normal sales scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power procurement agreements, and natural gas supply agreements. For economic hedges that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges,
the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in value of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated OCI and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. For economic hedges
that do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings each period and are classified as other derivatives in the following tables. Non-derivative contracts for access to
additional generation and for sales to load-serving entities are accounted for primarily under the accrual method of accounting, which is further discussed in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies. Additionally, Generation is exposed to
certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary activities are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s overall energy marketing activities.
             Commodity Price Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and
PECO)               Economic Hedging.  The
Registrants are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market
liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to
manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power sales, fuel and energy purchases, and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. In order to manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price
derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of energy and purchases of fuel and energy. The objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated
future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on electric generation operations, fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of power plants, and fixing the price for a portion of
anticipated energy purchases to supply load-serving customers. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s policies and hedging objectives, the market, weather conditions, operational and other factors.
Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include financial transmission
rights, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights.         
  In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation s owned and
contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2010, the percentage of expected generation hedged was 90%-93%, 67%-70%, and 32%-35% for
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation represents the amount of energy estimated to be generated or purchased through
owned or contracted capacity. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include cash flow hedges, other derivatives and certain non-derivative contracts including sales to ComEd and PECO to serve their retail load.

   ComEd has locked in a fixed price for a significant portion of its commodity price risk through
the five-year financial swap contract with Generation that expires on May 31, 2013, which is discussed in more detail below. In addition, the contracts that Generation has entered into with ComEd and that ComEd has entered into with Generation
and other suppliers as part of the ComEd power procurement agreements, which are further discussed in Note 2 Regulatory Matters, qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception. Based on the Illinois Settlement Legislation and
ICC-approved procurement methodologies permitting ComEd to recover its electricity procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up, ComEd s price risk related to power procurement is limited.   
        In order to fulfill a requirement of the Illinois Settlement,
Generation and ComEd entered into a five-year financial swap contract effective August 28, 2007. The financial swap is designed to hedge spot market purchases, which along with ComEd s remaining energy procurement contracts, meet its load
service requirements. The remaining swap contract volumes are 3,000 MW from January 2011 through May 2013. The terms of the financial swap contract require Generation to pay the around-the-clock market price for a portion of ComEd s electricity
supply requirement, while ComEd pays a fixed price. The contract is to be settled net, for the difference between the fixed and market pricing, and the financial terms only cover energy costs and do not cover capacity or ancillary services. The
financial swap contract is a derivative financial instrument that has been designated by Generation as a cash flow hedge. Consequently, Generation records the fair value of the swap on its balance sheet and records changes in fair value to OCI.
ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for this derivative financial instrument. ComEd records the fair value of the swap on its balance sheet, however, since the financial swap contract was deemed prudent by the Illinois Settlement Legislation,
ComEd receives full cost recovery for the contract in rates and the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the Illinois
Settlement. In Exelon s consolidated financial statements, all financial statement effects of the financial swap recorded by Generation and ComEd are eliminated.   
        On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year
floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts begins in June 2012. These contracts are designed to lock in a portion of the
long-term commodity price risk resulting from the renewable energy resource procurement requirements in the Illinois Settlement Legislation. ComEd has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative financial instruments. ComEd records the fair
value of the swap contracts on its balance sheet. Because ComEd receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, the change in fair value each period is recorded by ComEd as a regulatory asset or liability.
           Prior to January 1, 2011, PECO had transferred
substantially all of its commodity price risk related to its procurement of electric supply to Generation through a PPA that expired on December 31, 2010. The PPA was not considered a derivative under current derivative authoritative guidance.
PECO has entered into contracts to procure electric supply through a competitive RFP process as outlined in its PAPUC-approved DSP Program, which is further discussed in Note 2 Regulatory Matters. Based on Pennsylvania legislation and the DSP
Program permitting PECO to recover its electric supply procurement costs from retail customers with no mark-up, PECO s price risk related to electric supply procurement is limited. PECO locked in fixed prices for a significant portion of its
commodity price risk following the expiration of the electric generation rate caps through full requirements contracts and block contracts. PECO s full requirements contracts and block contracts, which are considered derivatives, qualify for
the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under current   
         233

derivative authoritative guidance. For block contracts designated as normal purchases after inception, the mark-to-market balances previously recorded will remain unchanged on PECO s
Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be amortized over the terms of the contracts.            PECO s natural gas procurement policy is designed to achieve a reasonable balance of long-term and short-term gas purchases under different pricing approaches in order to achieve system supply reliability at
the least cost. PECO s reliability strategy is two-fold. First, PECO must assure that there is sufficient transportation capacity to satisfy deliverability requirements. Second, PECO must ensure that a firm source of supply exists to utilize
the capacity resources. All of PECO s natural gas supply and management agreements that are derivatives qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Additionally, in accordance with the 2009 and 2010 PAPUC PGC settlements and to
reduce the exposure of PECO and its customers to natural gas price volatility, PECO has continued its program to purchase natural gas for both winter and summer supplies using a layered approach of locking-in prices ahead of each season with
long-term gas purchase agreements (those with primary terms of at least twelve months). Under the terms of the 2009 and 2010 PGC settlement, PECO is required to lock in (i.e. economically hedge) the price of a minimum volume of its long-term gas
commodity purchases. PECO s gas-hedging program covers 22% to 29% of planned natural gas purchases in support of projected firm sales. The hedging program for natural gas procurement has no direct impact on PECO s financial position or
results of operations as natural gas costs are fully recovered from customers under the PGC.             Proprietary Trading.  Generation also enters into certain energy-related derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts entered into purely to profit from market
price changes as opposed to hedging an exposure and is subject to limits established by Exelon s RMC. The proprietary trading activities which included physical volumes of 3,625 GWh, 7,578 GWh and 8,891 GWh for years ended December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are a complement to Generation s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation s revenue from energy marketing activities. Neither ComEd nor PECO enter into derivatives for
proprietary trading purposes.              Interest Rate Risk
(Exelon, Generation and ComEd)              The Registrants use
a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. The Registrants may also utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which are typically designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage their interest
rate exposure. In addition, the Registrants may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. These strategies are employed to achieve a
lower cost of capital. A hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with variable-rate debt would result in less than a $1 million decrease in Exelon s, Generation s, and ComEd s pre-tax income for the year ended
December 31, 2010.   
         234

    Fair Value Hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair
value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. Exelon includes the gain or loss on the hedged items and the offsetting
loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps in interest expense as follows for the year ended December 31, 2010:         
          At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon had $100 million of notional amounts of fair value hedges outstanding related to interest rate swaps, with fair value assets of $14 million and $10 million, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, there was no impact on the results of operations as a result of ineffectiveness from fair value hedges.         
   Cash Flow Hedges . On September 30, 2010, Generation issued and sold $350 million of senior notes due October 1, 2041. In
connection with this debt issuance, Generation entered into treasury rate locks in the aggregate notional amount of $240 million. The treasury rate locks were settled on September 27, 2010. Treasury rate locks are derivative instruments used to
lock in the interest rate prior to the issuance of debt. As a result of a decrease in interest rates during the period between the inception and settlement of the treasury rate locks, Generation recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million.
The loss was recorded to other comprehensive income within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the related debt as interest payments are made on the debt.
           In connection with Generation s September 2009 $1.5
billion debt issuance, Generation entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps in the aggregate notional amount of $1.1 billion. The interest rate swaps were settled on September 16, 2009 with Generation recording a $7 million pre-tax
gain. The gain was recorded to OCI within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized to income over the life of the related debt as a reduction in interest expense.            In connection with its August 2, 2010 issuance of First Mortgage Bonds, ComEd entered into treasury rate locks in
the aggregate notional amount of $350 million. The treasury rate locks were settled on July 27, 2010. As interest rates decreased since the inception of the treasury rate locks, ComEd recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million. Under
the authoritative accounting guidance for regulated operations, the loss was recorded as a regulatory asset within ComEd s Consolidated Balance Sheets at settlement and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the
related debt as interest payments are made on the debt.         
   Other Derivatives . On September 30, 2010, Generation issued and sold $550 million of 10-year Senior Notes. In connection with this debt
issuance, Generation entered into treasury rate locks in the aggregate notional amount of approximately $360 million. As a result of a decrease in interest rates during the period between the inception and settlement of the treasury rate locks,
Generation recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $5 million. The debt associated with these treasury rate locks, which was used to fund a portion of the Exelon Wind acquisition, was subject to a mandatory redemption provision in the event the
acquisition was not consummated on or prior to March 31, 2011. As a result, these treasury rate locks did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and the associated loss was recorded to interest expense within Generation s
Consolidated Income Statements. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on the redemption provision of this debt issuance.

     Fair Value Measurement (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)     
        Fair value accounting guidance requires the fair value of derivative
instruments to be shown in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the
table below, Generation s cash flow hedges, other derivatives and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross and the impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty, as well as netting of collateral, is aggregated
in the collateral and netting column. Excluded from the tables below are economic hedges that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and other non-derivative contracts that are accounted for under the accrual method of
accounting.            The following table provides a summary of the
derivative fair value balances recorded by the Registrants as of December 31, 2010:         

(a)  
  Includes current and noncurrent assets for Generation and current and noncurrent liabilities for ComEd of $450 million and $525 million, respectively, related to the fair value
of the five-year financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd, as described above.     

(b)  
  Represents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty and the application of collateral.     

(c)  
  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $725 million and $199 million, respectively, and current and noncurrent liabilities are shown inclusive of collateral
of $10 million and $17 million, respectively. The total cash collateral received net of cash collateral posted and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $951 million at December 31, 2010.     

(d)  
  Includes current assets for Generation and current liabilities for PECO of $5 million related to the fair value of PECO s block contracts with Generation. There were no
netting adjustments or collateral received as of December 31, 2010. The PECO block contracts were designated as normal as of May 31, 2010. As such, there were no effective changes in fair value of PECO s block contracts for the
remainder of 2010 as the mark-to-market balances previously recorded will be amortized over the term of the contract.     

(e)  
  Includes noncurrent assets relating to floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers recorded in other deferred debits and other assets on ComEd s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

   The following table provides a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded by the
Registrants as of December 31, 2009:         

(a)  
  Includes current and noncurrent assets for Generation and current and noncurrent liabilities for ComEd of $302 million and $669 million, respectively, related to the fair value
of the five-year financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd, as described above.     

(b)  
  Represents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty and the application of collateral.     

(c)  
  Current and noncurrent assets are shown net of collateral of $502 million and $376 million, respectively, and current liabilities are shown inclusive of collateral of $69
million, respectively. The allocation of collateral had no impact to noncurrent liabilities. The total cash collateral received net of cash collateral posted and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities was $947 million at
December 31, 2009.     

(d)  
  Includes a noncurrent asset for Generation and a noncurrent liability for PECO of $2 million related to the fair value of PECO s block contracts with Generation. There were
no netting adjustments or collateral received as of December 31, 2009.               Cash Flow Hedges (Exelon and Generation).  Economic hedges that qualify as cash flow hedges primarily consist of forward power sales and power swaps on base load generation. At December 31, 2010,
Generation had net unrealized pre-tax gains on effective cash flow hedges of $ 1,670 million being deferred within accumulated OCI, including approximately $975 million related to the financial swap with ComEd. Amounts recorded in accumulated
OCI related to changes in energy commodity cash flow hedges are reclassified to results of operations when the forecasted purchase or sale of the energy commodity occurs. Reclassifications from OCI are included in operating revenues, purchased power
and fuel in Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending on the commodities involved in the hedged transaction. Based on market prices at December 31, 2010, approximately $966 million of these net pre-tax
unrealized gains within accumulated OCI are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI during the next twelve months by   
         237

Generation, including approximately $450 million related to the financial swap with ComEd and $5 million related to PECO s block contracts with Generation. However, the actual amount
reclassified from accumulated OCI could vary due to future changes in market prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its cash flow hedges, including the ComEd financial swap contract, will occur during 2011 through 2013.
           Exelon discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it
determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item, in the case of forward-starting hedges, or when it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. For the year ended
December 31, 2010, amounts reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges were immaterial.         
  The table below provides the activity of accumulated OCI related to cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, containing
information about the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges and the reclassification from accumulated OCI into results of operations. The amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI, when combined with the impacts of the actual physical power
sales, result in the ultimate recognition of net revenues at the contracted price.         

(b)  
  Includes $228 million and $471 million of gains, net of taxes, related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of the five-year financial swap contract with ComEd for
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $2 million and $1 million of gains, net of taxes, of the effective portion of changes in fair value of the block contracts with PECO for the year ended December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The PECO block contracts were designated as normal sales as of May 31, 2010. As such, there were no effective changes in fair value of the block contracts with PECO for the remainder of 2010 as the mark-to-market balances
previously recorded will be amortized over the terms of the contracts.     

(c)  
  Includes $224 million and $161 million losses, net of taxes, reclassified from accumulated OCI to recognize gains in net income related to settlements of the five-year financial
swap contract with ComEd for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.     

(d)  
  Excludes $2 million of gains, net of taxes, related to interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $5 million of gains, net of
taxes, related to interest rate swaps for the year ended 2009. See Note 10 Debt and Credit Agreements for further information.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

(e)  
  Includes $3 million of losses, net of taxes, related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of treasury rate locks at Generation and ComEd, respectively.

(f)  
  Reflects the reclassifications of $4 million to regulatory assets and $1 million to deferred income tax liabilities within Exelon s and ComEd s Consolidated Balance
Sheets associated with settled treasury rate locks at ComEd.              During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Generation s cash flow hedge activity impact to pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from accumulated OCI to earnings was a
$1,125 million and $1,559 million pre-tax gain, and a $544 million pre-tax loss, respectively. Given that the cash flow hedges primarily consist of forward power sales and power swaps and do not include gas options or sales, the ineffectiveness of
Generation s cash flow hedges is primarily the result of differences between the locational settlement prices of the cash flow hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which
include financial transmission rights, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights. Changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness, primarily due to changes in market prices, were $1 million, $15
million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, none of which was related to Generation s financial swap contract with ComEd or Generation s block contracts with PECO. At December 31,
2010, cash flow hedge ineffectiveness resulted in an adjustment of $1 million to accumulated OCI on the balance sheet in order to reflect the effective portion of derivative gains or losses. At December 31, 2009, cash flow hedge ineffectiveness
was not significant.            Exelon s energy related cash flow
hedge activity impact to pre-tax earnings based on the reclassification adjustment from accumulated OCI to earnings was a $754 million and $1,292 million pre-tax gain and a $521 million pre-tax loss for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively. Changes in cash flow hedge ineffectiveness, primarily due to changes in market prices, were $1 million, $15 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31,
2010, cash flow hedge ineffectiveness resulted in an adjustment of $1 million to accumulated OCI on the balance sheet in order to reflect the effective portion of derivative gains or losses. At December 31, 2009, cash flow hedge ineffectiveness
was not significant.             Other Derivatives (Exelon and
Generation).  Other derivative contracts are those that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting. These instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and include financial
options, futures, swaps, and forward sales. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the following net pre-tax mark-to-market gains (losses) of certain purchase and sale contracts were reported in fuel and purchased power expense
at Exelon and Generation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. In the tables below,  Change in fair value  represents the change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement  represents the recognized change in
fair value that was reclassified to realized due to settlement of the derivative during the period.

Proprietary Trading Activities (Exelon
and Generation).  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Exelon and Generation recognized the following net unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses), net realized mark-to-market gains (losses) and total net mark-to-market
gains (losses) (before income taxes) relating to mark-to-market activity on derivative instruments entered into for proprietary trading purposes. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as operating revenue in Exelon s
and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in  Net fair value changes related to derivatives  in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the
tables below,  Change in fair value  represents the change in fair value of the derivative contracts held at the reporting date. The  Reclassification to realized at settlement  represents the recognized change in fair value that
was reclassified to realized due to settlement of the derivative during the period.         
            Credit Risk (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)
             The Registrants would be exposed to credit-related
losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that enter into derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. For energy-related
derivative instruments, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset
  
         240   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically, each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual
counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allow for cross-product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the
enabling agreement, Generation s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an
internal credit review that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty s margining thresholds
are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling agreement. Generation s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on
an individual and an aggregate basis.            The following tables
provide information on Generation s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, which includes contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception, and applicable payables and receivables, net of collateral and
instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2010. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual
counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a company s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. The figures in the tables below do not include credit risk exposure from uranium procurement contracts or exposure through RTOs,
ISOs and NYMEX and ICE commodity exchanges, which are discussed below. Additionally, the figures in the tables below do not include exposures with affiliates, including net receivables with ComEd and PECO of $58 million and $248 million,
respectively. See Note 21 Related-Party Transactions for further information.         
       
          ComEd s power procurement contracts
provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The credit position is based on forward market prices compared to the benchmark prices. The benchmark prices are the forward prices of energy projected through the contract term and are
set at the point of supplier bid submittals. If the forward market price of energy exceeds the benchmark price, the suppliers are required to post collateral for the secured credit portion. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents
ComEd s net credit exposure. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd s credit exposure to suppliers was immaterial.   
         241

   ComEd is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the Illinois Settlement
Legislation as well as the ICC-approved procurement tariffs. ComEd s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for further information.
           PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the
terms of its DSP program contracts and define a supplier s performance assurance requirements, allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the
supplier s lowest credit rating from S P, Fitch or Moody s and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day a transaction is executed,
compared to the current forward price curve for energy. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the
supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2010, PECO s net credit exposure to suppliers was immaterial and did not exceed the allowed unsecured credit levels.            PECO is permitted to recover its costs of procuring electric generation after December 31, 2010, through its
PAPUC-approved DSP program. PECO s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for further information.   
        PECO s natural gas procurement plan is reviewed and approved
annually on a prospective basis by the PAPUC. PECO s counterparty credit risk under its natural gas supply and management agreements is mitigated by its ability to recover its natural gas costs through the PGC, which allows PECO to adjust rates
quarterly to reflect realized natural gas prices. PECO does not obtain collateral from suppliers under its natural gas supply and management agreements. As of December 31, 2010, PECO had credit exposure of $10 million under its natural gas
supply and management agreements.              Collateral and Contingent-Related
Features (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and PECO)              As
part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical and financial contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities. Certain of Generation s derivative instruments contain
provisions that require Generation to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral
and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt
rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists
under applicable master netting agreements. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX and ICE. The NYMEX and ICE clearing houses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX and ICE must adhere to comprehensive
collateral and margining requirements.            The aggregate fair
value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on NYMEX and ICE that are fully collateralized) was $742 million and $894 million as
of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Generation had the contractual right of offset   
         242   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

of $717 million and $778 million, respectively, related to derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty under master netting agreements, resulting in a net liability position
of $25 million and $116 million, respectively. If Generation had been downgraded to the investment grade rating of BBB- and Baa3, or lost its investment grade credit rating, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of
approximately $57 million or $944 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and approximately $60 million or $673 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009 related to its financial instruments, including derivatives,
non-derivatives, normal purchase normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements and the application of collateral. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies
for information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.            Generation entered into SFCs with certain utilities, including PECO, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities
are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded. Under the terms
of the financial swap contract between Generation and ComEd, if a party is downgraded below investment grade by Moody s or S P, collateral postings would be required by that party depending on how market prices compare to the benchmark
price levels. Under the terms of the financial swap contract, collateral postings will never exceed $200 million from either ComEd or Generation. Beginning in June 2009, under the terms of ComEd s standard block energy contracts, collateral
postings are one-sided from suppliers, including Generation, should exposures between market prices and benchmark prices exceed established unsecured credit limits outlined in the contracts. As of December 31, 2010, there was no cash collateral
or letters of credit posted between energy suppliers, including Generation, and ComEd, under any of the above-mentioned contracts. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd did not hold any cash or letters of credit for the purpose of collateral from any
of the suppliers in association with energy procurement contracts. Beginning in June 2010, under the terms of ComEd s annual renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required to cover a fixed value for RECs only. In addition,
beginning in December 2010, under the terms of ComEd s long-term renewable energy contracts, collateral postings are required from suppliers for both RECs and energy. The REC portion is a fixed value and the energy portion is one-sided from
suppliers should the forward market prices exceed contract prices. As of December 31, 2010, ComEd held approximately $20 million in the form of cash and letters of credit as margin for both the annual and long-term REC obligations. See Note
2 Regulatory Matters for further information.         
  PECO s supplier master agreements that govern the terms of its DSP program contracts do not contain provisions that would require PECO to post
collateral.            PECO s natural gas procurement contracts
contain provisions that could require PECO to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon PECO s credit rating from Moody s and S P. The collateral and credit
support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2010, PECO was not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO lost its investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2010, PECO could
have been required to post approximately $68 million of collateral to its counterparties.            Exelon s interest rate swaps contain provisions that, in the event of a merger, require that Exelon s debt maintain an investment grade credit rating from Moody s or S P. If Exelon s debt
were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of these provisions, resulting in the ability of the

counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to maturity. Collateralization would not be required under any circumstance. Termination of the agreement could result in a settlement payment by
Exelon or the counterparty. The settlement amount would be equal to the fair value of the swap on the termination date. As of December 31, 2010, Exelon s interest rate swap was in an asset position, with a fair value of $14 million.
             Accounting for the Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts
(Exelon and Generation)              As of December 31,
2010 and 2009, $1 million and $6 million, respectively, of cash collateral received was not offset against net derivative positions, as they were not associated with energy-related derivatives.   
           10. Debt and Credit Agreements (Exelon, Generation,
ComEd and PECO)               Short-Term Borrowings
             Exelon meets its short-term liquidity requirements
primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the intercompany money pool. ComEd meets its short-term
liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under its credit facility.         
  Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO had the following amounts of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings outstanding at December 31,
2010 and 2009:         

(a)  
  Equals aggregate bank commitments under revolving credit agreements. See discussion below and Credit Agreements table below for items affecting effective program size.
          
          In order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each Registrant must have revolving credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper
program. While the amount of its commercial paper outstanding does not reduce available capacity under a Registrant s credit agreement, a Registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the available capacity under
its credit agreement.

n.a.  
  Not applicable.                Credit Agreements              As of December 31, 2010, Exelon Corporate, Generation and PECO had access to separate unsecured credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $957 million, $4.8 billion and $574 million, respectively.
The credit agreements expire on October 26, 2012, unless extended in accordance with their terms. Under their credit facilities, Exelon Corporate, Generation and PECO may request additional one-year extensions of that term. In addition, Exelon
Corporate, Generation and PECO may request increases in the aggregate bank commitments under their credit facilities up to an additional $250 million, $1 billion and $200 million, respectively. Exelon anticipates refinancing these credit facilities
in the first half of 2011.   
         245   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   On March 25, 2010, ComEd replaced its $952 million credit facility with a new three-year $1
billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires March 25, 2013, unless extended in accordance with its terms. ComEd may request additional one-year extensions of that term. In addition, ComEd may request increases in the aggregate bank
commitments under its credit facility up to an additional $500 million. Any such extensions or increases are subject to the approval of the lenders party to the credit facility.   
        The Registrants may use the credit facilities for general corporate
purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. The obligation of each lender to make any credit extension to a Registrant under its credit facilities is subject to various conditions including,
among other things, that no event of default has occurred for the Registrant or would result from such credit extension .  An event of default under any of the Registrants  credit facilities would not constitute an event of default
under any of the other Registrants  credit facilities, except that a bankruptcy or other event of default in the payment of principal, premium or indebtedness in principal amount in excess of $100 million in the aggregate by Generation
under its credit facility would constitute an event of default under the Exelon corporate credit facility.         
  At December 31, 2010, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings and available capacity under the
credit agreements:         

(a)  
  Excludes additional credit facility agreements for Generation, ComEd and PECO with aggregate commitments of $30 million, $32 million and $32 million, respectively, arranged with
minority and community banks located primarily within ComEd s and PECO s service territories. These facilities expire on October 21, 2011 and are solely for issuing letters of credit. As of December 31, 2010, letters of credit
issued under these agreements totaled $11 million, $26 million and $20 million for Generation, ComEd and PECO, respectively.           
  Borrowings under each credit agreement bear interest at a rate selected by the borrower based upon either the prime rate or at a rate fixed for a
specified period based upon a LIBOR-based rate. The Exelon, Generation and PECO agreements provide for an adder of up to 65 basis points to be added to the LIBOR-based rate, based upon the credit rating of the borrower. The ComEd agreement provides
for adders of up to 137.5 basis points for prime-based borrowings and 237.5 basis points for LIBOR-based borrowings to be added, based upon ComEd s credit rating.   
        Additionally, on November 4, 2010, Generation entered into a
supplemental credit facility, which provides for an aggregate commitment of up to $300 million. The effectiveness and availability of the credit facility were subject to various conditions, which were satisfied on February 7, 2011. This
facility will be primarily used to issue letters of credit, but also permits cash borrowings at a rate of LIBOR or a base rate, plus an adder of 200 basis points. No cash borrowings are anticipated under this facility.

   Each credit agreement requires the affected borrower to maintain a minimum cash from operations to
interest expense ratio for the twelve-month period ended on the last day of any quarter. The ratios exclude revenues and interest expenses attributable to securitization debt, certain changes in working capital, distributions on preferred securities
of subsidiaries and, in the case of Exelon and Generation, interest on the debt of its project subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the minimum thresholds reflected in the credit agreements for the year ended December 31, 2010:
        
          At December 31, 2010 the interest coverage ratios at the Registrants were as follows:         
            Variable Rate Debt              Under the terms of ComEd s variable-rate tax-exempt debt agreements, ComEd may be required to repurchase that debt before its stated maturity unless supported by sufficient letters of credit. If ComEd was
required to repurchase the debt, it would reassess its options to obtain new letters of credit or remarket the bonds in a manner that does not require letter of credit support. ComEd has classified certain amounts outstanding under these debt
agreements as long-term based on management s intent and ability to renew or replace the letters of credit, refinance the debt at reasonable terms on a long-term fixed-rate basis or utilize the capacity under existing long-term credit
facilities.            Generation had letter of credit facilities that
expired during the second quarter of 2010, which were used to enhance the credit of variable-rate long-term tax-exempt bonds totaling $213 million, with maturities ranging from 2016 2034. Generation repurchased the $213 million of tax-exempt
bonds during 2010 and permanently extinguished $24 million of these tax-exempt bonds. Generation has the ability to remarket the remaining bonds whenever it determines it to be economically advantageous.   
         Accounts Receivable Agreement    
        PECO is party to an agreement with a financial institution under which
it transferred an undivided interest, adjusted daily, in its customer accounts receivable designated under the agreement in exchange for proceeds of $225 million, which Exelon and PECO accounted for as a sale under previous guidance on accounting
for transfers of financial assets. The accounting guidance was amended, effective for the Registrants on January 1, 2010, and required that this transaction be accounted for as a secured borrowing, as the transferred interest did not meet the
criteria of a participating interest as defined under the authoritative guidance. Therefore, on January 1, 2010, the proceeds of $225 million representing the transferred interest in customer accounts receivable previously recorded as a
contra-receivable were reclassified to a short-term note payable on Exelon s and PECO s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the servicing liability of $2 million recorded under the previous guidance was released. As of
December 31, 2010, the financial institution s undivided interest in Exelon s and PECO s gross customer accounts receivable was equivalent to $346 million, which is calculated under the terms of the agreement. Upon termination or
liquidation of this agreement, the financial institution will be entitled to recover up to $225 million plus the accrued yield   
         247

payable from the pool of receivables pledged. On September 7, 2010, PECO extended this agreement, which terminates on September 6, 2011 unless further extended in accordance with its
terms. As of December 31, 2010, PECO was in compliance with the requirements of the agreement. In the event the agreement is not further extended, PECO has sufficient short-term liquidity and could seek alternative financing.   
          Long-Term Debt              The following tables present the outstanding long-term debt at Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO as of December 31,
2010 and 2009:              Exelon

        On January 18, 2011, ComEd issued $600 million of 1.625% First
Mortgage Bonds, Series 110, due January 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the Bonds were used by ComEd as an interim source of liquidity for the January 2011 contribution to Exelon-sponsored pension plans in which ComEd participates. ComEd
anticipates receiving tax refunds as a result of both the pension contribution and recent Federal tax legislation allowing for accelerated depreciation deductions in 2011 and 2012. As a result, the immediate and direct use of the net proceeds to
fund the planned contribution will allow

     Tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits     
        The following table provides a reconciliation of the Registrants 
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:         
          Included in Exelon s unrecognized tax
benefits balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are approximately $783 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, of tax positions for which the ultimate tax benefit is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such
benefits. The disallowance of such positions would not materially affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to or defer the receipt of the cash tax benefit from the taxing authority to an earlier or later period
respectively.              Unrecognized tax benefits that if
recognized would affect the effective tax rate           
  Exelon and Generation have $4 million and $4 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 that, if recognized,
would decrease the effective tax rate. Exelon, Generation and ComEd had $95 million, $33 million and $62 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate.

     Total amounts of interest and penalties recognized     
        Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO have reflected in their
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 a net interest receivable (payable) of $21 million, $(22) million, $14 million and $22 million, respectively, related to their uncertain tax positions. Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO
reflected in their Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 a net interest receivable (payable) of $28 million, $(17) million, $(28) million and $54 million, respectively, related to their uncertain tax positions. The Registrants
recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense (income) in other income and deductions on their Consolidated Statements of Operations. Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO have reflected in their Consolidated
Statements of Operations net interest expense of $110 million, $6 million, $57 million and $35 million, respectively, related to their uncertain tax positions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2009, Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO reflected in their Consolidated Statements of Operations net interest expense (income) of $(42) million, $9 million, $(62) million and $(5) million, respectively, related to their uncertain
tax positions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO reflected in their Consolidated Statements of Operations net interest expense (income) of $(31) million, $(11) million, $(2) million and $(12)
million, respectively, related to their uncertain tax positions. The Registrants have not accrued any penalties with respect to uncertain tax positions.

income tax refund claims taking the position that nuclear decommissioning liabilities assumed as part of its acquisition of nuclear power plants are taken into account in determining the tax basis in the assets it acquired. The additional basis
results primarily in reduced capital gains or increased capital losses on the sale of assets in nonqualified decommissioning funds and increased tax depreciation and amortization deductions. The IRS disagrees with this position and has disallowed
the claims. In November of 2008, Generation received a final determination from the Appeals division of the IRS (IRS Appeals) disallowing AmerGen s refund claims. On February 20, 2009, Generation filed a complaint in the United States
Court of Federal Claims to contest this determination. In August 2009, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed its answer denying the allegations made by Generation in its complaint. No trial date has yet been assigned, but trial could
occur sometime in 2012.            The trial judge assigned to the
case has noted the availability of the court s Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program as an alternative to a trial, but the parties have not yet met with the ADR judge. The ADR program is a non-binding process that utilizes a variety of
techniques such as mediation, neutral evaluation, and non-binding arbitration that allow the parties to better understand their differences and their prospects for settlement. The DOJ presently refuses to commit to participate in ADR. As a result,
it is unclear whether ADR will occur and if so, when.            In
addition, in the second quarter of 2010, Entergy Corporation concluded its trial in the United States Tax Court of a similar dispute involving the assumption of decommissioning liabilities in connection with the purchase of a nuclear power plant. It
is possible that a decision will be reached in that case in the next twelve months. While the decision in that case would not serve as binding precedent for AmerGen s litigation in the United States Court of Federal Claims, the reasoning of the

decision may cause Generation to reevaluate the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the possibility of quicker resolution through the ADR program and the possibility of a decision
being entered in the Entergy trial, Generation believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly decrease in the next twelve months.             Tax Method of Accounting for Repairs    
        In 2009, Exelon received approval from the IRS to change its method of
accounting for repair costs associated with Generation s power plants. The new tax method of accounting resulted in net positive cash flow for 2010 of approximately $160 million and approximately $420 million for 2009. Although the IRS granted
Exelon approval to change its method of accounting, the approval did not affirm the methodology used to calculate the deduction. Exelon had requested and received approval from the IRS to review its methodology through its Pre-Filing Agreement
program. However, in the second quarter of 2010, Exelon was informed that the IRS has suspended the pre-filing agreement process and instead intends to issue broad industry guidance with respect to electric generation power plants. If that broader
guidance is issued, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease within the next 12 months.         
  See 1999 Sale of Fossil Generating Assets in Other Tax Matters section below for information regarding the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
associated with this matter that could change significantly within the next 12 months.            See Competitive Transition Charges in Other Tax Matters section below for information regarding the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with this matter that could change significantly within the next 12
months.              Description of tax years that remain subject
to examination by major jurisdiction           
          The audit of Exelon s 2002 through 2006 taxable years was completed in the first quarter of 2010.         
   Other Tax Matters          
    IRS Appeals 1999-2001 (Exelon, ComEd and PECO)     
         1999 Sale of Fossil Generating Assets (Exelon and ComEd).
 Exelon, through its ComEd subsidiary, took two positions on its 1999 income tax return to defer approximately $2.8 billion of tax gain on the 1999 sale of ComEd s fossil generating assets. Exelon deferred approximately $1.6 billion of the
gain under the involuntary conversion provisions of the IRC. Exelon believes that it was economically compelled to dispose of ComEd s fossil generating plants as a result of the Illinois Act and that the proceeds from the sale of the fossil
plants were properly reinvested in qualifying replacement property such that the gain could be deferred over the lives of the replacement property under the involuntary conversion provisions. The remaining approximately $1.2 billion of the gain was
  
         256

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

deferred by reinvesting the proceeds from the sale in qualifying replacement property under the like-kind exchange provisions of the IRC. The like-kind exchange replacement property purchased by
Exelon included interests in three municipal-owned electric generation facilities which were properly leased back to the municipalities.         
  Exelon received the IRS audit report for 1999 through 2001, which reflected the full disallowance of the deferral of gain associated with both the
involuntary conversion position and the like-kind exchange transaction. Specifically, the IRS asserted that ComEd was not forced to sell the fossil generating plants and the sales proceeds were therefore not received in connection with an
involuntary conversion of certain ComEd property rights. Accordingly, the IRS asserted that the gain on the sale of the assets was fully subject to tax. The IRS also asserted that the Exelon purchase and leaseback transaction is substantially
similar to a leasing transaction, known as a SILO, which the IRS does not respect as the acquisition of an ownership interest in property. A SILO is a  listed transaction  that the IRS has identified as a potentially abusive tax shelter
under guidance issued in 2005. Accordingly, the IRS has asserted that the sale of the fossil plants followed by the purchase and leaseback of the municipal owned generation facilities does not qualify as a like-kind exchange and the gain on the sale
is fully subject to tax.             Competitive Transition Charges
(Exelon, ComEd, and PECO).  Exelon contended that the Illinois Act and the Competition Act resulted in the taking of certain of ComEd s and PECO s assets used in their respective businesses of providing electricity services in their
defined service areas. Exelon has filed refund claims with the IRS taking the position that CTCs collected during ComEd s and PECO s transition periods represent compensation for that taking and, accordingly, are excludible from taxable
income as proceeds from an involuntary conversion. The tax basis of property acquired with the funds provided by the CTCs would be reduced such that the benefits of the position are temporary in nature. The IRS disallowed the refund claims for the
1999-2001 tax years.            Under the Illinois Act, ComEd was
required to allow competitors the use of its distribution system resulting in the taking of ComEd s assets and lost asset value (stranded costs). As compensation for the taking, ComEd was permitted to collect a portion of the stranded costs
through the collection of CTCs from those customers electing to purchase electricity from providers other than ComEd. ComEd collected approximately $1.2 billion in CTCs for the years 1999-2006.   
        Similarly, under the Competition Act, PECO was required to allow others
the use of its distribution system resulting in the taking of PECO s assets and the stranded costs. Pennsylvania permitted PECO to collect CTCs as compensation for its stranded costs. The PAPUC determined the total amount of stranded costs that
PECO was permitted to collect through the CTCs to be $5.3 billion.             2009 Status of Tax Positions.  During 2009, Exelon held discussions with IRS Appeals in an attempt to reach a settlement on both the involuntary conversion and like-kind exchange positions, in a manner
commensurate with Exelon s and the IRS  respective hazards of litigation with respect to each issue. During the second quarter of 2009, Exelon determined that a settlement with IRS Appeals was unlikely and that Exelon would be required to
initiate litigation in order to resolve the issues. Accordingly, Exelon concluded that it had sufficient new information that a remeasurement of these two positions was required in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As a result, Exelon
recorded a $31 million (after-tax) interest benefit of which $40 million (after-tax) was recorded at ComEd. The difference in amounts recorded at Exelon and ComEd is due to the method of allocating interest to the Registrants.   
         257

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   Due to the fact that tax litigation often results in a negotiated settlement, as of
December 31, 2009, Exelon believed that an eventual settlement on the involuntary conversion position remained a likely outcome. Therefore, Exelon and ComEd established a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit consistent with their view as
to a likely settlement.            With regard to the like-kind
exchange transaction, as of December 31, 2009, Exelon believed it was likely that the issue would be fully litigated. Exelon assessed in accordance with accounting standards whether it would prevail in litigation. While Exelon recognized the
complexity and hazards of this litigation, it believed that it was more likely than not that it would prevail in such litigation and therefore eliminated any liability for unrecognized tax benefits.   
        In addition to attempting to impose tax on the transactions, the IRS
had asserted penalties of approximately $196 million for a substantial understatement of tax. Because Exelon believed it was unlikely that the penalty assertion would ultimately be sustained, Exelon and ComEd had not recorded a liability for
penalties as of December 31, 2009.             2010 Status of
Tax Positions.  In connection with Exelon s discussions with IRS Appeals during the second quarter of 2010, IRS Appeals proposed a settlement offer for the like-kind exchange transaction and involuntary conversion and CTC positions.
           Based on the status of these settlement discussions, Exelon
concluded that it had sufficient new information that a remeasurement of the involuntary conversion and CTC positions was required in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As a result of the required re-measurement in the second quarter
of 2010, Exelon recorded $65 million (after-tax) of interest expense, of which $36 million (after-tax) and $22 million (after-tax) were recorded at ComEd and PECO, respectively. ComEd also recorded a current tax expense of $70 million offset with a
tax benefit recorded at Generation of $70 million. The amount recorded at Generation reflects the reduction of current taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities for the increase in tax basis of the related assets transferred from ComEd in
accordance with the Contribution Agreement dated January 1, 2001, pursuant to which ComEd s generating business ultimately was transferred to Generation.   
        In the third quarter of 2010, Exelon and IRS Appeals reached a
nonbinding, preliminary agreement to settle Exelon s involuntary conversion and CTC positions. The agreement is consistent with IRS Appeals  second quarter offer to settle the involuntary conversion and CTC positions and also includes IRS
Appeals  agreement to withdraw its assertion of the $110 million substantial understatement penalty with respect to Exelon s involuntary conversion position. Final resolution of the involuntary conversion and CTC disputes remains subject
to finalizing terms and calculations and executing definitive agreements satisfactory to both parties. As a result of the preliminary agreement, Exelon and ComEd eliminated any liability for unrecognized tax benefits and established a current tax
payable to the IRS.            Under the terms of the preliminary
agreement, Exelon estimates that the IRS will assess tax and interest of approximately $300 million in 2011 for the years for which there is a resulting tax deficiency, of which $405 million would be paid by ComEd, $135 million would be received by
PECO, $10 million would be paid by Generation and the remainder received by Exelon. These amounts are net of approximately $300 million of refunds due from the settlement of the 2001 tax method of accounting change for certain overhead costs under
the SSCM as well as other agreed upon audit adjustments. In order to stop additional interest from accruing on the expected assessment, Exelon made a payment in December 2010 to the IRS of $302 million. See Note 21 Related Party Transactions
for the impact of   
         258   

Table of Contents

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

this payment on Exelon s and ComEd s intercompany balances. Further, Exelon expects to receive additional tax refunds of approximately $270 million between 2011 and 2014, of which $335
million would be received by ComEd, $40 million would be paid by Generation and the remainder paid by Exelon.         
  Also during the third quarter, Exelon and IRS Appeals failed to reach a settlement with respect to the like-kind exchange position. Exelon continues
to believe that its like-kind exchange transaction is not the same as or substantially similar to a SILO and does not believe that the concession demanded by the IRS in its settlement offer reflects the strength of Exelon s position. IRS
Appeals also continues to assert an $86 million penalty for a substantial understatement of tax with respect to the like-kind exchange position.         
  While Exelon has been and remains willing to settle the issue in a manner generally commensurate with its hazards of litigation, the IRS has thus
far been unwilling to settle the issue without requiring a nearly complete concession of the issue by Exelon. Accordingly, to continue to contest the IRS s disallowance of the like-kind exchange position and its assertion of the $86 million
substantial understatement penalty, Exelon expects to initiate litigation in the second half of 2011 after the final resolution of the involuntary conversion and CTC settlement. Given that Exelon has determined settlement is not a realistic outcome,
it has assessed in accordance with applicable accounting standards whether it will prevail in litigation. While Exelon recognizes the complexity and hazards of this litigation, it believes that it is more likely than not that it will prevail in such
litigation and therefore eliminated any liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Further, Exelon believes it is unlikely that the penalty assertion will ultimately be sustained, Exelon and ComEd have not recorded a liability for penalties. However,
should the IRS prevail in asserting the penalty it would result in an after-tax charge of $86 million to Exelon s and ComEd s results of operations.         
  As of December 31, 2010, assuming Exelon s preliminary settlement of the involuntary conversion position is finalized, the potential tax
and interest, exclusive of penalties, that could become currently payable in the event of a fully successful IRS challenge to Exelon s like-kind exchange position could be as much as $830 million, of which $540 million would be paid by ComEd
and the remainder by Exelon. If the IRS were to prevail in litigation on the like-kind exchange position, Exelon s results of operations could be negatively affected due to increased interest expense, as of December 31, 2010, by as much as
$230 million (after-tax), of which $180 million would be recorded at ComEd and the remainder by Exelon. Litigation could take several years such that the estimated cash and interest impacts would likely change by a material amount.   
        Based on Exelon management s expectations as to the potential of a
settlement and litigation outcome, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to these issues may significantly change within the next 12 months. It is not possible at this time to predict the amount, if any, of such a
change.              2011 Illinois State Tax Rate Legislation
(Exelon, Generation and ComEd)              The Taxpayer
Accountability and Budget Stabilization Act, (SB 2505), enacted into law in Illinois on January 13, 2011, increases the corporate tax rate in Illinois from 7.3% to 9.5% for tax years 2011 2014, provides for a reduction in the rate from
9.5% to 7.75% for tax years 2015 2024 and further reduces the rate from 7.75% to 7.3% for tax years 2025 and thereafter.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   The rate change from 7.3% to 9.5% will result in a one-time charge or credit to deferred taxes as
the balances must be recalculated at the new corporate tax rates. The Registrants are unable to estimate the impact at this time. Additionally, the rate change will increase future Illinois current state income taxes for Exelon, Generation, and
ComEd, including estimated increases in 2011 of approximately $25 million, $10 million and $10 million, respectively.         
    Illinois Replacement Investment Tax Credits (Exelon, Generation and ComEd)              On February 20, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Exelon s favor in a case involving refund claims for
Illinois investment tax credits. Responding to the Illinois Attorney General s petition for rehearing, on July 15, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court modified its opinion to indicate that it was to be applied only prospectively,
beginning in 2009. On December 22, 2009, Exelon filed a Petition of Writ for Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court appealing the Illinois Supreme Court s July 15, 2009 modified opinion. In the third quarter of 2009, Exelon,
Generation and ComEd decreased their unrecognized tax benefits related to this position. On March 1, 2010, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would not review the Illinois Supreme Court s decision. As a result of the United
States Supreme Court decision, Exelon, Generation and ComEd ceased reporting their unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2010.         
    Long-Term State Tax Apportionment (Exelon and Generation)     
        Exelon and Generation periodically review events that may
significantly impact how income is apportioned among the states and, therefore, the calculation of Exelon s and Generation s deferred state income taxes. On April 16, 2009, the PAPUC approved PECO s electricity procurement
proposal that will have an impact on Exelon s and Generation s apportionment of income among the states. Accordingly, Exelon and Generation reevaluated the impacts to deferred state taxes in the second quarter of 2009. The effect of such
evaluations resulted in the recording of a non-cash deferred state tax benefit in the amount of $34.7 million, net of taxes. Exelon and Generation have treated electricity as tangible personal property for this purpose which is consistent with the
February and July 2009 Illinois Supreme Court decisions. In 2010, the Registrants performed a review of the long-term state tax rates and noted no significant events that would materially impact state apportionment. As such, there was no update to
the long-term state apportionment rates in 2010.              Tax
Sharing Agreement (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)              Generation, ComEd and PECO are all party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax
Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net benefit attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants.
That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit. During 2010, Generation, ComEd and PECO recorded an allocation of Federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $60 million, $2
million and $43 million, respectively.         
     12. Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
          Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations     
        Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power
plants following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear   
         260

generating stations, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and
assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected on Exelon s and
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010:         

(a)  
  Includes $5 million and $17 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is included in other current liabilities on Exelon
and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets.              During 2010, Generation recorded a net increase in the ARO of $16 million, primarily reflecting the ZionSolutions  assumption of decommissioning and other liabilities for Zion Station (see discussion below);
and increases for accretion and for updates to estimated future cash flows across all of Generation s units. Changes in estimated future cash flows increased the ARO by $624 million, including approximately $200 million associated with the
accelerated timing of the Zion Station decommissioning. The remainder of the increase is the result of cost study estimate updates and the change in timing of general decommissioning activities at select sites in Generation s nuclear
fleet, including revisions to the timing and amount of SNF disposal; partially offset by the impacts of lower escalation rates. This change in the ARO resulted in an immaterial impact to Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statements of
Operations.            During 2009, Generation recorded a net decrease
in the ARO of $409 million, primarily due to an update in the third quarter of 2009, which reflected updated decommissioning cost studies received for six nuclear units and a decline from the previous year in the cost escalation factor assumptions
used to estimate future undiscounted decommissioning costs. This decrease in the ARO resulted in the recognition of $47 million of income (pre-tax), which is included in operating and maintenance expense in Exelon and Generation s Consolidated
Statements of Operations, representing the reduction in the ARO in excess of the existing ARC balances for the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units.         
    Zion Station Decommissioning           
  On December 11, 2007, Generation entered into an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) with EnergySolutions Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
EnergySolutions, LLC. (EnergySolutions) and ZionSolutions under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station, which is located in Zion, Illinois and ceased operation in 1998.   
         261   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   On September 1, 2010, Generation and EnergySolutions completed the transactions contemplated
by the ASA. Specifically, Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all of the assets (other than land) associated with Zion Station, including assets held in related NDT funds. In consideration for Generation s transfer of those
assets, ZionSolutions assumed decommissioning and other liabilities associated with Zion Station. Pursuant to the ASA, ZionSolutions can periodically request reimbursement from the Zion Station-related NDT funds for costs incurred related to the
decommissioning efforts at Zion Station. However, ZionSolutions is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to request that reimbursement; specifically, if certain milestones as defined within the ASA are not met, all or a portion of requested
reimbursements shall be deferred until such milestones are met. The transfer of the Zion Station assets did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and as a result, the related NDT funds were reclassified to Pledged assets for Zion Station
decommissioning within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to be measured in the same manner as prior to the completion of the transaction. Additionally, the extinguished ARO for decommissioning was replaced
with a payable to ZionSolutions in Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the value of the Zion Station NDT assets, net of applicable taxes, will be recorded as a change in the payable to ZionSolutions. At no point will
the payable to ZionSolutions exceed the project budget of the costs remaining to decommission Zion Station. Any Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning activities will be returned to ComEd customers. Generation
has retained its obligation to transfer the SNF at Zion Station to the DOE for ultimate disposal and maintains a liability of approximately $34 million, which is included within the nuclear decommissioning ARO. Generation also has retained a
requisite level of NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain and transfer the SNF at Zion Station. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Zion Station pledged assets, which include the related NDT funds, and the payable to Zion
Solutions were approximately $824 million and $786 million, respectively. The payable excludes a liability recorded within Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the tax obligation on the unrealized activity associated with the
Zion Station NDT funds. The NDT funds will be utilized to satisfy the tax obligations as gains and losses are realized. The current portion of the payable to ZionSolutions, included in Other Current Liabilities within Generation s Consolidated
Balance Sheets, was $127 million. As of December 31, 2010, ZionSolutions has withdrawn approximately $5 million for Zion Station decommissioning costs.         
  ZionSolutions leased the land associated with Zion Station from Generation pursuant to a Lease Agreement. Under the Lease Agreement, ZionSolutions
has committed to complete the required decommissioning work according to an established schedule and will construct a dry cask storage facility on the land for the SNF currently held in SNF pools at Zion Station. Rent payable under the Lease
Agreement is $1.00 per year, although the Lease Agreement requires ZionSolutions to pay property taxes associated with Zion Station and penalty rents may accrue if there are unexcused delays in the progress of decommissioning work at Zion Station or
the construction of the dry cask SNF storage facility. To reduce the risk of default by EnergySolutions or ZionSolutions, EnergySolutions provided a $200 million letter of credit to be used to fund decommissioning costs in the event the NDT assets
are insufficient. EnergySolutions has also provided a performance guarantee and entered into other agreements that will provide rights and remedies for Generation and the NRC in the case of other specified events of default, including a special
purpose easement for disposal capacity at the EnergySolutions site in Clive, Utah, for all LLRW volume of Zion Station.         
    Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments           
  NDT funds have been established for each generating station unit to satisfy Generation s nuclear decommissioning obligations. NDT funds
established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.   
         262

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    
     
   The NDT funds associated with the former ComEd, former PECO and former AmerGen units have been
funded with amounts collected from ComEd customers, PECO customers and the previous owners of the former AmerGen plants, respectively. Based on an ICC order, ComEd ceased collecting amounts from its customers to pay for decommissioning costs. PECO
currently collects funds, in revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are expected to continue through the operating lives of the plants. The amounts collected from PECO customers
are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC reflecting updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs. The most recent rate adjustment occurred on
January 1, 2008 and the effective rates currently yield annual collections of $29 million. The next five-year adjustment is expected to be reflected in rates charged to PECO customers effective January 1, 2013. With respect to the former
AmerGen units, Generation does not collect any amounts, nor is there any mechanism by which Generation can seek to collect additional amounts, from customers. Apart from the contributions made to the NDT funds from amounts collected from ComEd and
PECO customers, Generation has not made contributions to the NDT funds.            Any shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. Generation has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO
customers related to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC. Generally, PECO will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first $50
million of any shortfall of trust funds, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units, compared to decommissioning obligations, as well as 5% of any additional shortfalls. This initial $50 million and up to 5% of any additional shortfalls would
be borne by Generation. No recourse exists to collect additional amounts from ComEd customers for the former ComEd units or from the previous owners of the former AmerGen units. With respect to the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds remaining in
the NDTs after decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd s or PECO s customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO units. With respect
to the former AmerGen units, Generation retains any funds remaining in the NDTs after decommissioning.         
  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon and Generation had NDT fund investments totaling $6,408 million and $6,669 million, respectively.
           During 2010, there were no changes in NDT investment
strategy. At December 31, 2010, approximately 57% of the funds were invested in equity and 43% were invested in fixed income securities. At December 31, 2009, approximately 53% of the funds were invested in equity and 47% were invested in
fixed income securities.             Securities Lending Program. 
Generation s NDT funds currently participate in a securities lending program with the trustees of the plans  investment trusts. Under the program, securities loaned by the trustees are required to be collateralized by cash, U.S. Government
securities or irrevocable bank letters of credit. Initial collateral levels are no less than 102% and 105% of the market value of the borrowed securities for collateral denominated in U.S. and foreign currency, respectively. Subsequent collateral
levels must be maintained at a level no less than 100% of the market value of borrowed securities. Cash collateral received may not be sold or re-pledged by the trustees unless the borrower defaults.   
        In the fourth quarter of 2008, Exelon decided to end its participation
in this securities lending program and initiated a gradual withdrawal of the trusts  investments in order to minimize potential

losses due to liquidity constraints in the market. Currently, the weighted average maturity of the securities within the collateral pools is approximately 11 months. The fair value of securities
on loan was approximately $51 million and $357 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of cash and non-cash collateral received for these loaned securities was $51 million and $366 million at December 31, 2010
and 2009, respectively. A portion of the income generated through the investment of cash collateral is remitted to the borrowers, and the remainder is allocated between the trusts and the trustees in their capacity as security agents.   
         NRC Minimum Funding Requirements . NRC regulations require that
licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as calculated using
the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded on Generation s and Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals,
decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC
methodology, then the NRC requires either further funding or other financial guarantees. Key assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2010 include: (1) only one decommissioning scenario
for each unit; (2) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (does not include the possibility of license renewal for those units that have not already received renewals, except for Oyster Creek); (3) NRC minimum
funding assumes current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (4) annual after-tax returns on the NDT funds are assumed to be 2% (3% for
the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC). In contrast, Generation s key assumptions related to calculating the ARO and forecasting the target growth in the NDT funds used by Generation at December 31, 2010 include: (1) the
ARO is determined using multiple scenarios where decommissioning activities are completed under three possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations; (2) the plants cease operating at the end of an
extended license life (assuming 20-year license renewal extensions); (3) the ARO is the present value of the future obligation and the annual average accretion of the ARO is approximately 6.2% through a period of approximately 30 years after
the end of the extended lives of the units; and (4) the estimated targeted annual after-tax return on the NDT funds is 4.6% to 5.4% (as compared to a historical 5-year annual average after-tax return of approximately 5%).   
        Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit
(annually for units that have been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of
the trust funds, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or make additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the
trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Exelon s and Generation s cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected.   
        On March 10, 2010, Generation notified the NRC that it had
remediated the December 31, 2009 underfunded position of its Byron and Braidwood NDT funds with the establishment of approximately $44 million in parent guarantees in accordance with a plan submitted by Generation to the NRC on July 31,
2009. On May 26, 2010, the NRC notified Generation that while the previously established parent guarantees complied with Generation s remediation plan, additional parent guarantees may be required to meet the future value of the
underfunded position. During the third quarter of 2010,   
         264

Generation established approximately $175 million in additional parent guarantees. Generation has not received any subsequent communication from the NRC following the establishment of these
additional parent guarantees.            Generation has determined
that as of December 31, 2010, the modest recovery in the financial markets has improved decommissioning funding levels for Byron and Braidwood such that parent guarantees are no longer required to meet the NRC s minimum funding
requirements. Generation intends to notify the NRC that parent guarantees are no longer required, on or before the date of the next NRC-required biennial decommissioning funding assurance submission, to be made no later than March 31, 2011. As
the future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation s units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be
collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.   
         Accounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreements with ComEd and
PECO . Based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC that dictates Generation s obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis, as long as funds
held in the NDT funds exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation, decommissioning-related activities, including realized and unrealized income and losses on the NDT funds and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are generally
offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables
to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, ComEd has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability. Should the value of the NDT fund for
any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the estimated decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for that unit would be discontinued, the
decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the adverse impact to Exelon s and Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material. At December 31,
2010, the NDT funds of each of the former ComEd units exceeded the related decommissioning obligation for each of the units. For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is the ARO reflected on
Generation s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 and is different from the calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines.            Based on the regulatory agreement supported by the PAPUC that dictates Generation s rights and obligations related
to the shortfall or excess of trust funds necessary for decommissioning the seven former PECO nuclear units, regardless of whether the funds held in the NDT funds exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation,
decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations results in an
equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at Exelon. Likewise, PECO has recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and a corresponding regulatory
liability. Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon s and Generation s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the impact to Exelon s and
Generation s results of operations and financial position could be material. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for information

regarding the approved Settlement permitting the NDCAC to continue after the termination of PECO s CTC collections on December 31, 2010. The Settlement will not result in a material
impact to Exelon or Generation s future results of operations, cash flows or financial position.         
  The decommissioning-related activities related to the Clinton, Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island nuclear plants (the former AmerGen units) and the
portions of the Peach Bottom nuclear plants that are not subject to regulatory agreements with respect to the NDT funds are reflected in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations, as there are no regulatory agreements
associated with these units. Refer to Note 19 Supplemental Financial Information and Note 21 Related Party Transactions for information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd
and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund the customers any decommissioning-related assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.         
  The following table provides unrealized gains (losses) on NDT funds for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008:

  Interest and dividends on NDT fund investments are recognized when earned and are included in Other, net in Exelon s and Generation s
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest and dividends earned on the NDT fund investments for the Regulatory Agreement Units, which are subject to regulatory accounting, are eliminated within Other, net in Exelon and Generation s
Consolidated Statement of Operations.             Non-Nuclear Asset Retirement
Obligations (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, and PECO)          
  Generation has AROs for plant closure costs associated with its fossil, hydroelectric and wind generating stations, including asbestos abatement,
removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of wind generating stations and other decommissioning-related activities. ComEd and PECO have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and
disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Registrants  accounting policy for AROs.

           13. Retirement Benefits (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and
PECO)             As of December 31, 2010, Exelon sponsored
five qualified defined benefit pension plans, two non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and three other postretirement benefit plans for essentially all Generation, ComEd, PECO and BSC employees.   
        Exelon s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended
to be tax-qualified defined benefit plans. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly
hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated under the IRC as qualified trusts. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to
the qualified trusts, subject to certain IRC limitations.

     Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets, and Funded Status     
        Exelon recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and regulatory assets, in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance.
The impact of changes in assumptions used to measure pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is generally recognized over the expected average remaining service period of the plan participants. The measurement date for the plans is
December 31. The following table provides a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for the most recent two years for all plans combined:

   The funded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations refers to the
difference between plan assets and estimated obligations of the plan. The funded status changes over time due to several factors, including contribution levels, assumed discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.   
        The following tables provide the projected benefit obligations (PBO),
accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets and a PBO in excess of plan assets.   
     
          On an ABO basis, the plans were funded at 76% at December 31, 2010 compared to 73% at December 31, 2009. On a PBO basis, the plans were funded at 71% at December 31, 2010 compared to 68% at
December 31, 2009. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO includes no assumption about future compensation levels.         
    Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs           
  The following table provides the components of the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for all
plans combined. The table reflects a reduction in 2010, 2009 and 2008 of net periodic postretirement benefit costs of approximately $38 million for each year, related to a Federal subsidy provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Modernization Act), discussed further below.         
          Through Exelon s postretirement
benefit plans, the Registrants provide retirees with prescription drug coverage. The Medicare Modernization Act, enacted on December 8, 2003, introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a Federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare   
         269

prescription drug benefit. Management believes the prescription drug benefit provided under Exelon s postretirement benefit plans meets the requirements for the subsidy. See the Health Care
Reform Legislation section below for further discussion regarding the income tax treatment of Federal subsidies of prescription drug benefits.         
  The effect of the subsidy on the components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010, 2009 and 2008 included in the consolidated
financial statements was as follows:         
            Components of OCI and Regulatory Assets
             Under the authoritative guidance for regulatory
accounting, a portion of current year actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized within Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be
recorded to OCI. The following tables provide the components of OCI and regulatory assets for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for all plans combined.   

(a)  
  Of the $464 million related to pension benefits, $310 million and $154 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2010. Of the $(27) million
related to other postretirement benefits, $(9) million and $(18) million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2010. Of the $(309) million related to pension benefits, $(204) million and $(105) million were recognized
in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2009. Of the $(194) million related to other postretirement benefits, $(85) million and $(109) million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2009. Of the $3,297
related to pension benefits, $2,069 million and $1,228 million were recognized in AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2008. Of the $489 million related to other postretirement benefits, $245 million and $244 million were recognized in
AOCI and regulatory assets, respectively, during 2008.

   The following table provides the components of Exelon s gross accumulated other comprehensive
loss and regulatory assets that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for all plans combined:   

The following table provides the components of Exelon s AOCI and regulatory assets as of December 31, 2010 (included in the table above)
that are expected to be amortized as components of periodic benefit cost in 2011. These estimates are subject to the completion of an actuarial valuation of Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which will reflect
actual census data as of January 1, 2011 and actual claims activity as of December 31, 2010. The valuation is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011.   

Assumptions              The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon s defined benefit and other
postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The
measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, Exelon s expected level of contributions to the
plans, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the long-term expected investment rate credited to
employees of certain plans and the anticipated rate of increase of   
         271

health care costs, among other factors. The impact of changes in assumptions used to measure pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is generally recognized over the expected average
remaining service period of the plan participants.         
   Expected Rate of Return.  In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including
inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon s target asset class allocations. In general, equity securities, real estate and private
equity investments are forecasted to have higher returns than fixed income securities.            The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for all of the plans at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations
are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year s net periodic benefit costs.         
          The following weighted average
assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for all the plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

  Not applicable to pension and other postretirement benefit plans that do not have any plan assets.

   Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the costs reported for the other

(405  
  )                Health Care Reform Legislation              In March 2010, the Health Care Reform Acts were signed into law. A number of provisions in the Health Care Reform Acts impact retiree health care plans provided by employers. One such provision reduces the
deductibility, for Federal income tax purposes, of retiree health care costs to the extent an employer s postretirement health care plan receives Federal subsidies that provide retiree prescription drug benefits at least equivalent to those
offered by Medicare. Although this change did not take effect immediately, the Registrants were required to recognize the full accounting impact in their financial statements in the period in which the legislation was enacted. As a result, in the
first quarter of 2010, Exelon recorded total after-tax charges of approximately $65 million to income tax expense to reverse deferred tax assets previously established. Of this total, Generation, ComEd and PECO recorded charges of $24 million, $11
million and $9 million, respectively.            Additionally, the
Health Care Reform Acts include a provision that imposes an excise tax on certain high-cost plans beginning in 2018, whereby premiums paid over a prescribed threshold will be taxed at a 40% rate. The application of the legislation is still unclear
and Exelon continues to monitor for additional guidance from the Department of Labor and IRS. Certain key assumptions are required to estimate the impact of the excise tax on Exelon s postretirement benefit obligation, including projected
inflation rates (based on the Consumer Price Index) and whether pre- and post-65 retiree populations can be aggregated in determining the premium values of health care benefits. Exelon reflected its best estimate of the excise tax impact in its
annual actuarial measurement, which increased its postretirement benefit obligation by $145 million as of December 31, 2010.         
    Contributions           
  Exelon allocates pension and other postretirement benefit contributions to its subsidiaries in proportion to active service costs recognized and
total costs recognized, respectively. The following table provides contributions made by Generation, ComEd, PECO and BSC to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:   

273

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

(a)  
  The Registrants present the cash contributions above net of Federal subsidy payments received on each of their respective Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO received Federal subsidy payments of $10 million, $5 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2010, $10 million, $5 million, $3 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2009, and $12 million, $5 million, $3
million and $2 million, respectively, in 2008.     
          Exelon
contributed $2.1 billion to its qualified pension plans in January 2011, of which Generation, ComEd and PECO contributed $952 million, $871 million and $110 million, respectively. No further contributions to the qualified pension plans are currently
anticipated for 2011. Exelon plans to contribute $6 million to its non-qualified pension plans in 2011, of which Generation, ComEd and PECO will contribute $3 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. Management considers various factors
when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the
Act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk
status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification).            Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon s other postretirement plans are not subject to regulatory minimum contribution requirements. Management considers several factors in determining the level of
contributions to Exelon s other postretirement benefit plans, including levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications. Exelon expects to contribute approximately $185 million to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2011, of
which Generation, ComEd and PECO expect to contribute $85 million, $58 million and $29 million, respectively.         
  During the first quarter of 2011, Exelon will receive an updated valuation of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to reflect
actual census data as of January 1, 2011.             Estimated
Future Benefit Payments             Estimated future benefit
payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2010 were:

    Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries             Generation, ComEd and PECO account for their participation in Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit
plans by applying multiemployer accounting. Employee-related assets and liabilities, including both pension and postretirement liabilities, were allocated by Exelon to its subsidiaries based on the number of active employees as of January 1,
2001 as part of Exelon s corporate restructuring. Exelon allocates the components of pension and other postretirement costs to the participating employers based upon several factors, including the measures of active employee participation in
each participating unit. The obligation for Generation, ComEd and PECO reflects the initial allocation and the cumulative costs incurred and contributions made since January 1, 2001.            The following approximate amounts were included in capital and operating and maintenance expense during 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively, for Generation s, ComEd s, PECO s and BSC s allocated portion of the Exelon-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans:   

(a)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations.     
          Plan Assets     
         Investment Strategy.  On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its
investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.   
        In the second quarter of 2010, Exelon modified its pension investment
strategy in order to reduce the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. As a result of this modification, over time, Exelon determined that it will decrease equity investments and increase investments in fixed income
securities and alternative investments in order to achieve a balanced portfolio of risk-reducing and return-seeking assets. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the
plans  liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Over the next several years, Exelon expects to migrate to a target asset allocation of approximately 30% public equity investments, 50% fixed income investments and
20% alternative investments.            The change in the overall
investment strategy would tend to lower the expected rate of return on plan assets in future years as compared to the previous strategy. Exelon used an EROA of 8.00% and 7.08% to estimate its 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit costs,
respectively.

   Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan target asset allocations and
December 31, 2010 and 2009 weighted average asset allocations were as follows:              Pension Plans           
            Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans           

(a)  
  Alternative investments include real estate, private equity and hedge fund investments.     
         Securities Lending Programs.  The majority of the benefit plans
currently participate in a securities lending program with the trustees of the plans  investment trusts. Under the program, securities loaned to the trustees are required to be collateralized by cash, U.S. Government securities or
irrevocable bank letters of credit. Initial collateral levels are no less than 102% and 105% of the market value of the borrowed securities for collateral denominated in U.S. and foreign currency, respectively. Subsequent collateral levels must be
maintained at a level no less than 100% of the market value of borrowed securities. Cash collateral received may not be sold or re-pledged by the trustees unless the borrower defaults.            In the fourth quarter of 2008, Exelon decided to end its participation in this securities lending program and initiated a
gradual withdrawal of the trusts  investments in order to minimize potential losses due to liquidity constraints in the market. Currently, the weighted average maturity of the securities within the collateral funds is approximately 7 months.
The fair value of securities on loan was approximately $46 million and $356 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of cash and non-cash collateral received for these loaned securities was $47 million at
December 31, 2010 and $365 million at December 31, 2009. A portion of the income generated through the investment of cash collateral is remitted to the borrowers, and the remainder is allocated between the trusts and the trustees in their
capacity as security agents.             Concentrations of Credit
Risk.  Exelon evaluated its pension and other postretirement benefit plans  asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2010. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include,
but are not limited to, investment

concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2010, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10
percent of plan assets) of risk in Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.              Fair Value Measurements              The following table presents Exelon s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets measured and recorded at fair value on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level

         Cash equivalents . Investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered cash equivalents and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.   
         Equity securities . With respect to individually held equity
securities, including investments in U.S. and international securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained

from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually are primarily traded on exchanges which contain only actively
traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.             Commingled funds . Commingled funds are maintained by investment companies and hold certain investments in
accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with Exelon s overall investment strategy. Commingled funds seek to generate returns through a broad range of strategies. The values of the majority of commingled funds are
not publicly quoted. For equity and fixed-income commingled funds which are not publicly traded, the fund administrators value the funds using the net asset value per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying
securities. These funds have been categorized as Level 2. Equity and fixed-income funds with publicly quoted prices have been categorized as Level 1.         
   Private equity investments . Private equity investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not
publicly traded on a stock exchange. Investment strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are
based on the valuation of the underlying investments which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. Since these valuation inputs are not highly observable, private equity
investments have been categorized as Level 3.             Hedge fund
investments . Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is estimated using net asset value
per share (NAV) of the investments. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV within the near term. Since these valuations are not highly observable, hedge fund investments have been categorized as Level 3.   
         Fixed-income securities . For fixed income securities, the
trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each
security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that
another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively
corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized in Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. The fair values of
fixed income securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as
Level 2. To draw parallels from the trading and quoting of fixed income securities with similar features, pricing services consider various characteristics including the issuer, maturity, purpose of loan, collateral attributes, prepayment speeds,
interest rates and credit ratings in order to properly value these securities.             Real Estate.  Real estate investment trusts are valued daily based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1. Real estate commingled funds are funds with a direct investment in a pool
of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment managers on a

periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. Since these valuation inputs are not highly observable, real estate commingled
funds have been categorized as Level 3 investments.             401(k) Savings Plan
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             Exelon,
Generation, ComEd and PECO participate in a 401(k) savings plan sponsored by Exelon. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO match a
percentage of the employee contribution up to certain limits. The cost of matching contributions to the savings plan totaled the following:         
             14. Corporate Restructuring and Plant Retirements (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)          
  The Registrants provide severance and health and welfare benefits to terminated employees primarily based upon each individual employee s years
of service and compensation level. The Registrants accrue amounts associated with severance benefits that are considered probable and that can be reasonably estimated.   
        The following tables present total severance benefits costs, recorded
as operating and maintenance expense in relation to the announced job reductions, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:         

(a)  
  The amounts above include $7 million, $4 million, and $2 million at Generation, ComEd and PECO, respectively, for amounts billed through intercompany allocations for the year
ended December 31, 2009.     

(b)  
  The severance benefits costs include $1 million of stock compensation expense collectively at Generation and ComEd for which the obligation is recorded in equity for the year
ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Severance benefits also include $4 million and $2 million at Exelon and ComEd, respectively, of contractual termination benefits expense for which the obligation is recorded in other postretirement
benefits.                  Corporate
restructuring (Exelon, Generation,    ComEd and PECO).  In June 2009, Exelon announced a restructured senior executive team and major spending cuts, including the elimination of approximately 500 employee positions. Exelon eliminated
approximately 400 corporate support positions, mostly located at corporate headquarters, and 100 management level positions at ComEd, the majority of which was completed by September 30, 2009. These actions were in response to the continuing
economic challenges confronting all parts of Exelon s business and industry especially in light of the commodity-driven nature of Generation s markets, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced efficiency and
productivity.            Exelon recorded a pre-tax charge for
estimated salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits of $40 million in June 2009 as a result of the planned job reductions. Subsequent to June 2009, Exelon recorded a net pre-tax credit of approximately $6 million, which included a
$10

million reduction in estimated salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits, offset by $4 million of expense for contractual termination benefits. Cash payments under the plan
began in July 2009 and were substantially completed at December 31, 2010.            The following table presents the activity of severance obligations for the corporate restructuring from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010, excluding obligations recorded in equity:   
     
            Plant Retirements (Exelon and
Generation).   On December 8, 2010, in connection with the executed Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the NJDEP, Exelon announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31,
2019. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the closure of Oyster Creek.                On December 2, 2009, Exelon announced its intention to permanently retire three coal-fired generating units and one oil/gas-fired generating unit, effective May 31, 2011. The units to be retired are
Cromby Generating Station (Cromby) Unit 1 and Unit 2 and Eddystone Generating Station (Eddystone) Unit 1 and Unit 2. These actions were in response to the economic outlook related to the continued operation of these four units. Subsequently, PJM
determined that transmission reliability upgrades will be necessary to alleviate reliability impacts and that those upgrades will be completed in a manner that will permit Generation s retirement of the units on the following schedule: Cromby
Unit 1 and Eddystone Unit 1 on May 31, 2011; Cromby Unit 2 on December 31, 2011; and Eddystone Unit 2 on June 1, 2012. These dates are dependent upon the completion of required transmission reliability upgrades and may be subject to
further change. Generation revised the depreciable useful lives for these affected units to reflect the aforementioned anticipated deactivation dates. On June 10, 2010, Generation filed with FERC a reliability-must-run rate schedule providing
the terms, conditions and cost-based rates under which Generation will continue to operate Cromby Unit 2 and Eddystone Unit 2 for reliability purposes beyond their planned May 31, 2011 deactivation date. As a result of a proposed settlement
reached with FERC Staff and other intervenors on December 14, 2010 regarding the terms of the reliability-must-run rate schedule, which is subject to FERC approval, the total compensation under the reliability-must-run rate schedule would be
approximately $6 million and $2 million of monthly fixed-cost recovery for Generation during the reliability-must-run period for Eddystone Unit 2 and Cromby Unit 2, respectively. In addition, Exelon Generation will be reimbursed for variable costs
including fuel, emissions costs, chemicals, auxiliary power and for project investment costs during the reliability-must-run period.         
  Such revenue is intended to recover total expected operating costs, plus a return on net assets, of the two units during the reliability-must-run
period. In connection with these retirements, Exelon will eliminate approximately 280 employee positions, the majority of which are located at the units to be retired. Total expected costs for Generation related to the announced retirements is $38
million, which includes $15 million for estimated salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits, a $17

million write down of inventory and $6 million of shut down and other related costs. Cash payments under this plan began in January 2010 and will continue through 2013. Additionally, total
expected accelerated depreciation expense is approximately $206 million.            During 2009, Generation recorded a pre-tax charge of $24 million related to the announced retirements, which included a $7 million charge for estimated salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits,
and $17 million of expense for the write down of inventory recorded within operating and maintenance expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, during 2009, Generation recorded $32 million of
accelerated depreciation expense within depreciation and amortization expense in Exelon s and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Generation recorded a net $3 million charge
which is primarily due to an increase in estimated salary continuance and health and welfare severance benefits and $80 million of accelerated depreciation expense.   
        The following table presents the activity of severance obligations for
the announced Cromby and Eddystone retirements from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010:         
             15. Preferred Securities
(Exelon, ComEd and PECO)             At December 31, 2010 and
2009, Exelon was authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred securities, none of which were outstanding.         
   Preferred and Preference Securities of Subsidiaries          
  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, ComEd prior preferred securities and ComEd cumulative preference securities consisted of 850,000 shares and
6,810,451 shares authorized, respectively, none of which were outstanding.

   At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PECO cumulative preferred securities, no par value, consisted
of 15,000,000 shares authorized and the outstanding amounts set forth below. Shares of preferred securities have full voting rights, including the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors.

  Redeemable, at the option of PECO, at the indicated dollar amounts per share, plus accrued dividends.                 16. Common Stock (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
        At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon s common stock without
par value consisted of 2,000,000,000 shares authorized and 661,845,411 and 659,798,515 shares outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, ComEd s common stock with a $12.50 par value consisted of 250,000,000 shares authorized
and 127,016,519 shares outstanding. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, PECO s common stock without par value consisted of 500,000,000 shares authorized and 170,478,507 shares outstanding.   
        ComEd had 75,139 and 75,294 warrants outstanding to purchase ComEd
common stock as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants. At December 31, 2010
and 2009, 25,046 and 25,098 shares of common stock, respectively, were reserved for the conversion of warrants.             Share Repurchases          
   Share Repurchase Programs . In April 2004, Exelon s Board of Directors approved a discretionary share repurchase program that allowed
Exelon to repurchase shares of its common stock on a periodic basis in the open market. The share repurchase program was intended to mitigate, in part, the dilutive effect of shares issued under Exelon s employee stock option plan and
Exelon s ESPP. The aggregate value of the shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the program cannot exceed the economic benefit received after January 1, 2004 due to stock option exercises and share purchases pursuant to
Exelon s ESPP. The economic benefit consists of the direct cash proceeds from purchases of stock and the tax benefits associated with exercises of stock options. The 2004 share repurchase program had no specified limit on the number of shares
that could be repurchased and no specified termination date. Any shares repurchased are held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon s management.   
        In the third quarter of 2008, Exelon s Board of Directors approved
a share repurchase program for $1.5 billion of its common stock. Subsequently, Exelon management determined to defer indefinitely any share repurchases. This decision was made in light of a variety of factors, including: developments

affecting the world economy and commodity markets, including those for electricity and gas; the continued uncertainty in capital and credit markets and the potential impact of those events on
Exelon s future cash needs; projected cash needs to support investment in the business, including maintenance capital and nuclear uprates; and value-added growth opportunities.            Under the share repurchase programs dating back to 2004, 34.7 million shares of common stock are held as treasury
stock with a cost of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2010. During 2010 and 2009, Exelon had no common stock repurchases.         
   Stock-Based Compensation Plans          
  Exelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily includes performance share awards, stock options and restricted stock units. At
December 31, 2010, there were approximately 21 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from
authorized but unissued common stock shares.            As the LTIP
sponsor, Exelon is the sole issuer of all stock-based compensation awards. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The stock-based compensation expense specifically attributable to the
employees of Generation, ComEd and PECO is directly recorded to operating and maintenance expense within each of their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations. Stock-based compensation expense attributable to BSC employees is allocated
to the Registrants using a cost-causative allocation method.         
  The following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

   The following table presents stock-based compensation expense (pre-tax) during the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:         

(a)  
  These amounts primarily represent amounts billed to Exelon s subsidiaries through intercompany allocations.     
        There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized
during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.         
  Exelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and distribution date for
performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs. The tax deductions in excess of the benefits recorded throughout the
requisite service period are recorded to common stock and are included in other financing activities within Exelon s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table presents information regarding Exelon s tax benefits during the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:   
           Stock Options          
  Non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon s common stock are granted under the LTIP. The exercise price of the stock options is
equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options granted under the LTIP generally become exercisable upon a specified vesting date. The vesting period of stock options is generally four years.
All stock options expire ten years from the date of grant.            The value of stock options at the date of grant is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for stock options is generally four years. However, certain
stock options become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility.   
         286   

Table of Contents

   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

The value of the stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement
eligibility.            Exelon grants most of its stock options in the
first quarter of each year. Stock options granted during the remaining quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant.         
  The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following table presents
the weighted average assumptions used in the pricing model for grants and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:   
     
          The dividend yield is based on several factors, including Exelon s most recent dividend payment at the grant date and the average stock price over the previous year. Expected volatility is based on implied
volatilities of traded stock options in Exelon s common stock and historical volatility over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The risk-free interest rate for a security with a term equal to the expected life is based on a yield
curve constructed from U.S. Treasury strips at the time of grant. For each year presented, the expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Exelon believes
that the simplified method is appropriate due to several factors that result in historical exercise data not being sufficient to determine a reasonable estimate of expected term. Exelon uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which
are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary.            The following table presents information with respect to stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2010:         

(a)  
  Includes stock options issued to retirement eligible employees.

   The following table summarizes additional information regarding stock options exercised during the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:         

(a)  
  The difference between the market value on the date of exercise and the option exercise price.     
        The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested stock option
activity for the year ended December 31, 2010:         

(b)  
  Includes 506,200 of stock options issued to retirement-eligible employees in 2010 that vested immediately upon the employee reaching retirement eligibility.
             As of December 31, 2010, $7 million
of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.24 years.   
         Restricted Stock Units    
        Exelon grants restricted stock units under the LTIP. The majority of
Exelon s restricted stock units will be settled in common stock. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments, the cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of restricted stock units to be
settled in stock is required to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued. On a very limited basis, Exelon has granted restricted stock units to certain ComEd executives that will be settled in cash. The
obligations related to these restricted stock units have been classified as liabilities on Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are remeasured each reporting period throughout the requisite service period.   
        The value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite
service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching
retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is   
         288

either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which
are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary.            The following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2010:   

(b)  
  Represents restricted stock units that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2010.     
        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of restricted
stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $44.23, $56.08 and $74.83, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Exelon had obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units not yet settled
of $38 million and $42 million, respectively, which are included in common stock in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Exelon had obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units that will be settled in cash of $1
million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, which are included in deferred credits and other liabilities in Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Exelon settled restricted stock
units with fair value totaling $22 million, $17 million and $10 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $19 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over
the remaining weighted-average period of 2.07 years.         
   Performance Share Awards          
  Exelon grants performance share awards under the LTIP. The number of performance shares granted is determined based on the performance of
Exelon s common stock relative to certain stock market indices during the three-year period through the end of the year of grant. These performance share awards generally vest and settle over a three-year period. The holders of performance
share awards receive shares of common stock and/or cash annually during the vesting period. Participants are eligible for partial or full distributions in cash if they meet certain stock ownership requirements.   
        Performance share awards to be settled in stock are recorded as common
stock within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recorded at fair value at the date of grant. The grant date fair value of equity classified performance share awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2010 was estimated using
historical data for the previous two plan years and a Monte Carlo simulation model for the current plan year. This model requires assumptions regarding Exelon s total shareholder return relative to certain stock market indices and the stock
beta and volatility of Exelon s common stock and all stocks represented in these indices. Volatility for Exelon and all comparable companies is based on historical volatility over one year using daily stock price observation. Performance share

awards expected to be settled in cash are recorded as liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The grant date fair value of liability classified performance share awards granted during
the year ended December 31, 2010 was based on historical data for the previous two plan years and actual results for the current plan year. The liabilities are remeasured each reporting period throughout the requisite service period and as a
result, the compensation costs for cash-settled awards are subject to volatility.            For non retirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the graded-vesting method, a method in which the compensation cost is recognized
over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were multiple awards. For performance shares granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably
over the vesting period which is the year of grant.            The
following table summarizes Exelon s nonvested performance share awards activity for the year ended December 31, 2010:         

(b)  
  Represents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2010.     
        The weighted average grant date fair value (per share) of performance
share awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $60.82, $57.34 and $72.89, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Exelon settled performance shares with a fair value totaling
$32 million, $47 million and $69 million, respectively, of which $20 million, $30 million and $44 million was paid in cash, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $2 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested
performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.3 years.         
  The following table presents the balance sheet classification of obligations related to outstanding performance share awards not yet settled:

      17. Earnings Per Share and Equity (Exelon)    
          Earnings per Share     
        Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock outstanding under Exelon s LTIPs considered to be common stock
equivalents. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of these stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used
in calculating diluted earnings per share:         
          The number of stock options not included
in the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding due to their antidilutive effect was approximately 8 million in 2010, 5 million in 2009 and less than 1 million in 2008.               18. Commitments and Contingencies (Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)    
         Nuclear Insurance             The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an
incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and also to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2010, the current liability limit per incident was $12.6 billion and
is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors. An inflation adjustment must be made at least once every 5 years and the last inflation adjustment was made effective October 29, 2008.
In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public
liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. As of January 1, 2011, the amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $375 million for each operating site. Additionally, the Price-Anderson Act requires a second
layer of protection through the mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power reactors (currently 104 reactors) resulting in an additional $12.2 billion in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this
secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Under the Price-Anderson Act, the maximum assessment
in the event of an incident for each nuclear operator, per reactor, per incident (including a 5% surcharge), is $117.5 million, payable at no more than $17.5 million per reactor per incident per year. Exelon s maximum liability per incident is
approximately $2.0 billion. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $12.6 billion limit for a single incident.

   Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of insurance
that demonstrates Generation possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance
policies purchased from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.         
  NEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years NEIL has made distributions to its
members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will continue at all. NEIL declared a distribution for 2010, of which Generation s portion was $20 million. The distribution was recorded as a reduction to
operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Premiums paid to NEIL by its members are subject to assessment (the retrospective premium obligation) for adverse
loss experience. NEIL has never exercised this assessment since its formation in 1973, and while Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments, or if they will be imposed at all, the current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium
obligation for Generation is approximately $212 million.         
  NEIL provides property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its
nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Generation s current limit for this coverage is $2.1 billion. For property limits in excess of the first $1.25 billion of that limit, Generation participates in an $850 million
single limit blanket policy shared by all the Generation operating nuclear sites and the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear sites. This blanket limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss. In the event of an accident, insurance
proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to
maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. Under the terms of the various
insurance agreements, Generation could be assessed up to $168 million per year for losses incurred at any plant insured by the insurance company (the retrospective premium obligation). In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental
property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery for all losses by all insureds will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional
amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source, applicable to such losses. The $3.2 billion maximum recovery limit is not applicable, however, in the event of a  certified act of
terrorism  as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act expires on December 31, 2014.   
        Additionally, NEIL provides replacement power cost insurance in the
event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station. The premium for this coverage is subject to assessment for adverse loss experience. Generation s maximum share of any assessment is $44 million per year (the retrospective
premium obligation). Recovery under this insurance for terrorist acts is subject to the $3.2 billion aggregate limit and secondary to the property insurance described above. This limit would not apply in cases of certified acts of terrorism under
the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, as described above.

   Effective April 1, 2009, NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit
rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.            In addition, Generation participates in the Master Worker Program, which provides coverage for worker tort claims filed
for bodily injury caused by a nuclear energy accident. This program was modified, effective January 1, 1998, to provide coverage to all workers whose  nuclear-related employment  began on or after the commencement date of reactor
operations. Generation will not be liable for a retrospective assessment under this policy.            For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not
recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon s and Generation s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   
         Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation    
        Under the NWPA, the DOE is responsible for the development of a
geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation s nuclear generating
stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation pays the DOE one mill ($.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. This fee may be adjusted prospectively in order to ensure full cost recovery.
The NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its performance will be delayed
significantly. In January 2009, the DOE issued its Draft National Transportation Plan for the proposed repository. The DOE s press statement accompanying the release of the plan indicated that shipments to the repository are not expected to
begin before 2020.            The 2010 Federal budget (which became
effective October 1, 2009) eliminated almost all funding for the creation of the Yucca Mountain repository while the Obama administration devises a new strategy for long-term SNF management. Debate surrounding any new strategy likely will
address centralized interim storage, permanent storage at multiple sites and/or SNF reprocessing. In early 2010, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu appointed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America s Nuclear Future to evaluate and recommend a new
plan for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including used fuel storage, disposal and fees. John W. Rowe, Exelon s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is one of 15 members of the Commission, which is expected to issue a
draft report in July 2011.            Given the program s history
of funding restrictions, it is likely that shipments to the repository will not begin by 2020. Significant delays in choosing and developing a repository site are expected. Because there is no particular date after 2020 that Generation can establish
as having a higher probability as the start date for facility operations, Generation uses the 2020 date as the assumed date for when the DOE will begin accepting SNF for purposes of determining nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations.
The extended delay in SNF acceptance by the DOE has led to Generation s adoption of dry cask storage at its Dresden, Limerick, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Byron, Braidwood, LaSalle and Quad Cities stations. Generation performed sensitivity
analyses assuming that the estimated date for the DOE acceptance of SNF was delayed to 2025 and to 2035 and determined that Generation s aggregate nuclear ARO would be reduced by an immaterial amount
  
         293

in each scenario. In August 2004, Generation and the U.S. DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse Generation for costs
associated with storage of SNF at Generation s nuclear stations pending the DOE s fulfillment of its obligations. Generation submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases,
reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.         
  Under the agreement, Generation has received cash reimbursements for costs incurred through April 30, 2010, totaling approximately $461 million
($377 million after considering amounts due to co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek). As of December 31, 2010, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement will be requested from the DOE under
the settlement agreement is $84 million, which is recorded within accounts receivable, other. Of this amount, $4 million represents amounts owed to the co-owners of the Peach Bottom and Quad Cities generating facilities.   
        The Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the
DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear generation through April 6, 1983. The fee related to the former PECO units has been paid. Pursuant to the Standard Contracts, ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $277
million for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. As of December 31, 2010, the unfunded SNF liability for the one-time fee with interest was
$1,018 million. Interest accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week Treasury Rate in effect, for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2010, was 0.127%. The liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee,
were transferred to Generation as part of the 2001 corporate restructuring. The outstanding one-time fee obligations for the Oyster Creek and TMI units remain with the former owners. Clinton has no outstanding obligation. See Note 8 Fair Value
of Assets and Liabilities for additional information.             Energy Commitments
            Generation s wholesale operations include the
physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity, and long-, intermediate- and short-term contracts. Generation maintains a net positive supply of energy and capacity, through ownership of generation assets and power
purchase and lease agreements, to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its owned or contracted power generating units. Generation has also contracted for access to additional generation through bilateral long-term PPAs. These
agreements are firm commitments related to power generation of specific generation plants and/or are dispatchable in nature. Several of Generation s long-term PPAs, which have been determined to be operating leases, have significant contingent
rental payments that are dependent on the future operating characteristics of the associated plants, such as plant availability. Generation recognizes contingent rental expense when it becomes probable of payment. Generation enters into PPAs with
the objective of obtaining low-cost energy supply sources to meet its physical delivery obligations to its customers. Generation has also purchased firm transmission rights to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its
power supplies to meet customer delivery needs. The primary intent and business objective for the use of its capital assets and contracts is to provide Generation with physical power supply to enable it to deliver energy to meet customer needs.
Generation primarily uses financial contracts in its wholesale marketing activities for hedging purposes. Generation also uses financial contracts to manage the risk surrounding trading for profit activities.   
        Generation has entered into bilateral long-term contractual obligations
for sales of energy to load-serving entities, including electric utilities, municipalities, electric cooperatives and retail load

aggregators. Generation also enters into contractual obligations to deliver energy to wholesale market participants who primarily focus on the resale of energy products for delivery. Generation
provides delivery of its energy to these customers through rights for firm transmission.            At December 31, 2010, Generation s short- and long-term commitments, relating to the purchase from and sale to unaffiliated utilities and others of energy, capacity and transmission rights, are as
indicated in the following tables:         

(a)  
  Net capacity purchases include PPAs and other capacity contracts that are accounted for as operating leases. Amounts presented in the commitments represent Generation s
expected payments under these arrangements at December 31, 2010. Expected payments include certain capacity charges which are contingent on plant availability.     

(b)  
  Excludes renewable energy PPA contracts that are contingent in nature.     

(c)  
  Transmission rights purchases include estimated commitments for additional transmission rights that will be required to fulfill firm sales contracts.     
        Pursuant to a PPA with Public Service Company of Oklahoma, a subsidiary
of American Electric Power, dated as of April 17, 2009, Generation agreed to sell its rights to up to 520 MW, or approximately two-thirds of the capacity, energy and ancillary services supplied under its existing long-term contract with Green
Country Energy, LLC. The delivery of power under the PPA is to commence June 1, 2012 and run through February 28, 2022.         
  On December 17, 2009, Generation entered into a PPA with Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETI) to sell 150 MWs through April 30, 2011 and 300 MWs
thereafter of capacity and energy from the Frontier Generating Station located in Grimes County, Texas. The approximate ten year PPA is not included within the Net Capacity table above because it is contingent upon ETI waiving or obtaining
regulatory approvals, which has not yet occurred.            ComEd
purchases its expected energy requirements through an ICC approved competitive bidding process administered by the IPA, existing ICC approved RFPs and SFCs, and spot market purchases hedged with a financial swap contract with Generation expiring in
2013. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for further information.            PECO s long-term PPA with Generation under which PECO obtained all of its electric supply from Generation over the past 12 years expired on December 31, 2010. During 2009 and 2010, PECO entered into
procurement contracts through a competitive procurement process in order to meet a portion of its customers  electric supply requirements for 2011 through 2015. As of December 31, 2010, the 2011 expected energy requirements for all
customer classes have been substantially procured. PECO will conduct five additional competitive procurements over the remaining term of their DSP Program. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for further information.

   Indemnifications Related to Sithe (Exelon and Generation)          
  On January 31, 2005, subsidiaries of Generation completed a series of transactions that resulted in Generation s sale of its investment in
Sithe. Specifically, subsidiaries of Generation consummated the acquisition of Reservoir Capital Group s 50% interest in Sithe and subsequently sold 100% of Sithe to Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy).   
        In connection with the sale, Generation recorded liabilities related to
certain indemnifications provided to Dynegy and other guarantees directly resulting from the transaction. Any activity related to Sithe recorded in Exelon s Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded as discontinued operations. During
2008, Generation reduced its guarantee liabilities and recognized $38 million of income in discontinued operations related to the expiration of tax indemnifications. As of December 31, 2010, Generation had $6 million in recorded guarantee
obligations remaining. The estimated maximum possible exposure to Exelon related to the guarantees provided as part of the sales transaction to Dynegy was approximately $200 million at December 31, 2010.   
         Indemnifications Related to Sale of TEG and TEP (Exelon and Generation)
            On February 9, 2007, Tamuin International Inc.
(TII), a wholly owned subsidiary of Generation, sold its 49.5% ownership interests in TEG and TEP to a subsidiary of AES Corporation for $95 million in cash plus certain purchase price adjustments. In connection with the transaction, Generation
entered into a guarantee agreement under which Generation guarantees the timely payment of TII s obligations to the subsidiary of AES Corporation pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement relating to the sale of TII s
ownership interests. Generation would be required to perform in the event that TII does not pay any obligation covered by the guarantee that is not otherwise subject to a dispute resolution process. Generation s maximum obligation under the
guarantee is $95 million. Generation has not recorded a liability associated with this guarantee. The exposures covered by this guarantee expired in part during 2008. Generation expects that the remaining exposure will expire by 2014.   
         Environmental Issues               General.   The Registrants  operations have in the past and may in the future require substantial
expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by
them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by
substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional
proceedings in the future.

   ComEd and PECO have identified 42 and 27 sites, respectively, where former MGP activities have or
may have resulted in actual site contamination. For almost all of these sites, ComEd or PECO is one of several PRPs that may be responsible for ultimate remediation of each location. Of the 42 sites identified by ComEd, the Illinois EPA or U.S. EPA
have approved the cleanup of 12 sites and of the 27 sites identified by PECO, the PA DEP has approved the cleanup of 16 sites. Of the remaining sites identified by ComEd and PECO, 24 and 9 sites, respectively, are currently under some degree of
active study and/or remediation. ComEd and PECO anticipate that the majority of the remediation at these sites will continue through at least 2015 and 2018, respectively.   
        In January 2008, ComEd and Nicor Gas Company, a subsidiary of Nicor
Inc. (Nicor), reached a settlement agreement on the allocation of costs for the 38 former MGP sites for which ComEd or Nicor, or both, have responsibility. This agreement was approved by the ICC on June 9, 2009. The approval of
the settlement by the ICC did not have an impact on ComEd s cash flows or results of operations.         
  During the third quarter of 2010, ComEd and PECO each completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. The results
of these studies indicated that additional remediation would be required at certain sites; accordingly, ComEd and PECO increased their reserves and regulatory assets by $13 million and $2 million, respectively. Pursuant to orders from the ICC and
PAPUC, respectively, ComEd and PECO are authorized to and are currently recovering environmental costs for the remediation of former MGP facility sites from customers, for which they have recorded regulatory assets. PECO s 2010 approved natural
gas distribution rate case settlement increased the annual MGP recovery to be collected from customers beginning January 2011. See Note 2 Regulatory Matters for additional information.   
        As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Registrants have accrued the
following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in other deferred credits and other liabilities within their Consolidated Balance Sheets:         
          The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur other significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants,
environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers.         
    Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act.   In July 2004, the U.S. EPA issued the final Phase II rule implementing
Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act requires that the cooling   
         301   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. The Phase II rule provided each facility with a number of
compliance options and permitted site-specific variances based on a cost-benefit analysis. The requirements were intended to be implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation s power generation facilities with cooling
water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected. Those facilities are Clinton, Cromby, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, Handley, Mountain
Creek, Oyster Creek, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, Salem and Schuylkill.            In a 2007 decision, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the Phase II rule back to the U.S. EPA for revisions. The court found that with respect to a number of significant provisions of the rule the
EPA exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act, failed to adequately set forth its rationale for the rule, or failed to follow required procedures for public notice and comment. By its action, the court invalidated compliance measures which
were supported by the utility industry because they were cost-effective and provided existing plants with needed flexibility in selecting the compliance option appropriate to its location and operations. On July 9, 2007, the EPA formally
suspended the Phase II rule.            In April 2009, the U.S.
Supreme Court reversed the decision of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in one respect, and determined that the EPA could use a cost-benefit analysis under Section 316(b) to determine the best technology available for minimizing adverse
environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The U.S. EPA is considering the rule on remand and will take further action consistent with the opinions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, including whether to exercise its
discretion to retain or modify the cost-benefit rule as it appeared in the initial regulation. In November 2010, the EPA reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the Section 316(b) litigation that requires the EPA to issue a proposed rule by
March 14, 2011, and to publish a final rule by July 27, 2012. Until then, the state permitting agencies will continue the current practice of applying their best professional judgment to address impingement and entrainment requirements at
plant cooling water intake structures. The Courts  opinions have created uncertainty about the specific nature, scope and timing of the final compliance requirements.   
        On January 7, 2010, the NJDEP issued a draft NPDES permit for
Oyster Creek that would have required, in the exercise of its best professional judgment, the installation of cooling towers as the best technology available within seven years after the effective date of the permit. On December 8, 2010, Exelon
announced that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek by December 31, 2019. The current NRC license for Oyster Creek expires in 2029. In reliance upon Exelon s determination to cease generation operations
no later than December 31, 2019, the NJDEP determined that closed cycle cooling is not the best technology available for Oyster Creek given the length of time that would be required to retrofit from the existing once-through cooling system to a
closed-cycle cooling system and the limited life span of the plant after installation of a closed-cycle cooling system. Based on its consideration of these and other factors, in its best professional judgment, NJDEP determined that the existing
measures at the plant represent the best technology available for the facility s cooling water intake system.         
  On December 9, 2010, Generation executed an Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the NJDEP regarding Oyster Creek. The ACO sets forth, among
other things, the agreement by Generation to permanently cease generation operations at Oyster Creek if the conditions of the ACO are satisfied. In the ACO, the NJDEP agreed to issue a new draft NPDES permit without a requirement for construction of
cooling towers or other closed cycle cooling facilities. It is expected that a draft   
         302   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

NPDES permit will be issued and will become final and effective sometime in 2011. The ACO applies only to Oyster Creek based on its unique circumstances and does not set any precedent for the
ultimate compliance requirements for Section 316(b) at Exelon s other plants.            As a result of the decision and the ACO, the expected economic useful life of Oyster Creek has been reduced. The financial impacts, which are not expected to be material to Generation s results of operations,
will relate primarily to accelerated depreciation and accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning assumptions related to Generation s asset retirement obligation over the remaining expected economic useful life of Oyster
Creek. As a result of the announcement to close Oyster Creek by 2019, Generation s operating expenses increased by $7 million (pre-tax) in 2010 and are estimated to increase approximately $25-$30 million (pre-tax) in each of the years 2011
through 2015. The impacts to Generation s operating expenses in years 2016 through 2019 will be dependent on future capital spending at Oyster Creek. Generation will also make employee retention payments of approximately $20 million in 2011
that are expected to increase operating expenses by approximately $4 million (pre-tax) in each of the years 2011 through 2015.         
  In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed NPDES permit for Salem, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with its existing cooling water
system. NJDEP advised PSEG in July 2004 that it strongly recommended reducing cooling water intake flow commensurate with closed-cycle cooling as a compliance option for Salem. PSEG submitted an application for a renewal of the permit on
February 1, 2006. In the permit renewal application, PSEG analyzed closed-cycle cooling and other options and demonstrated that the continuation of the Estuary Enhancement Program, an extensive environmental restoration program at Salem, is the
best technology to meet the Section 316(b) requirements. PSEG continues to operate Salem under the approved June 2001 NPDES permit while the NPDES permit renewal application is being reviewed. If the final permit or Section 316(b)
regulations ultimately requires the retrofitting of Salem s cooling water intake structure to reduce cooling water intake flow commensurate with closed-cycle cooling, Exelon s and Generation s share of the total cost of the retrofit
and any resulting interim replacement power would likely be in excess of $500 million, based on a 2006 estimate, and would result in increased depreciation expense related to the retrofit investment.   
        It is unknown at this time whether the final regulations or permit will
require closed-cycle cooling at Salem. In addition, the economic viability of Generation s other power generation facilities without closed-cycle cooling water systems will be called into question by any requirement to construct cooling towers.
Given the uncertainties associated with these proceedings and the time required for their resolution, Generation cannot predict the eventual outcome of the proceedings or estimate the effect that compliance with any resulting Section 316(b) or
interim state requirements will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.         
    Cotter Corporation.   The U.S. EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially
liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. On February 18, 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any
liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to Generation. Cotter is alleged to have disposed of approximately
39,000 tons of soils mixed with 8,700 tons of leached barium sulfate at the site. On May 29, 2008, the U.S. EPA issued a Record of Decision approving the remediation option submitted by Cotter and the two other PRPs that required additional
landfill cover. The current estimated cost of the anticipated landfill cover remediation for the site is approximately $40 million, which will be allocated among all   
         303   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    
   (Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)    

PRPs. Generation has accrued what it believes to be an adequate amount to cover its anticipated share of such liability. By letter dated January 11, 2010, the U.S. EPA requested that the
PRPs perform a supplemental feasibility study for a remediation alternative that would involve excavation of the radiological contamination. An excavation remedy would be significantly more expensive than the previously selected additional cover
remedy; however, Generation believes the likelihood that the U.S. EPA would require the use of an excavation remedy is remote.         
    Air.     On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit
Court) vacated the CAIR, which had been promulgated by the U.S. EPA to reduce power plant emissions of SO   2    and NO   x   . The Court later remanded the CAIR to
the U.S. EPA, without invalidating the entire rulemaking, so that the U.S. EPA could correct CAIR in accordance with the Court s July 11, 2008 opinion. On July 6, 2010, the U.S. EPA published the proposed Transport Rule as the
replacement to the CAIR. The first phase of the NO   x    and SO   2    emissions reductions under the proposed Transport Rule regulations will commence in 2012,
with further reductions of SO   2    emissions proposed to become effective in 2014.
Given its low carbon generation portfolio, Generation does not currently expect the adoption of the rules as proposed to have a significant impact on its future capital spending requirements. These emissions limits will be further reduced as the
U.S. EPA finalizes more restrictive NAAQS in the 2011-2012 timeframe.            The proposed Transport Rule regulations also would limit the use of allowance trading to achieve compliance and restrict entirely the use of pre-2012 allowances. Existing SO2 allowances under the ARP would remain
available for use under ARP. During the third quarter of 2010, Generation recognized a lower of cost or market impairment charge of $57 million on its ARP SO   2    allowances that are not expected to be used by Generation s fossil-fuel power plants and that have not been sold forward. The
impairment was recorded due to the significant decline of allowance market prices because proposed Transport Rule regulations would restrict entirely the use of ARP SO   2    allowances beginning in 2012. As of December 31, 2010, Generation had $10 million of emission allowances carried at the lower
of weighted average cost or market.            Additionally, as of
December 31, 2010, Exelon has a $629 million net investment in coal-fired plants in Georgia and Texas subject to long-term leases extending through 2028-2032. While Exelon currently estimates the value of these plants at the end of the lease
term will be in excess of the recorded residual lease values, the ultimate passage of the proposed Transport Rule could negatively impact the end-of-lease term values of these assets, which could result in a future impairment loss that could be
material.            In March 2005, the U.S. EPA finalized the CAMR,
which was a national program to cap mercury emissions from fossil-fired generating units starting in 2010, with a second reduction in the mercury emission cap level scheduled for 2018. The D.C. Circuit Court later vacated the CAMR on the basis that
the U.S. EPA had failed to properly de-list mercury as a HAP under Section 112(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act. The result of this decision is that mercury emissions from electric generating stations are subject to the more stringent requirements of
maximum achievable control technology applicable to HAPs. In resolution of the CAMR litigation, the U.S. EPA entered into a Consent Decree that requires it to propose by March 16, 2011 HAP regulations for emissions from fossil generating
stations, and to publish final HAP regulations by November 15, 2011. The nature and extent of future regulatory controls on HAP emissions at electric generation power plants will not be determined until the Federal regulations are finalized by
the U.S. EPA.

   The U.S. EPA has announced that it will complete a review of NAAQS in the 2011-2012 timeframe for
ozone (nitrogen oxide and volatile organic chemicals), particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead. This review could result in more stringent emissions limits on fossil-fired electric generating stations.   
          Climate Change
Regulation.   Exelon is subject to climate change regulation or legislation at the international, Federal, regional and state levels. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that GHG emissions are pollutants subject to regulation under the
new motor vehicle provisions of the Clean Air Act. Consequently, on December 7, 2009, the U.S. EPA issued an endangerment finding under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act regarding GHGs from new motor vehicles and on April 1, 2010
issued final regulations limiting GHG emissions from cars and light trucks effective on January 2, 2011. While such regulations do not specifically address stationary sources, such as a generating plant, it is the U.S. EPA s position that
the regulation of GHGs under the mobile source provisions of the Clean Air Act has triggered the permitting requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permit sections of the Clean Air Act for new and
modified stationary sources effective January 2, 2011. Therefore, on May 13, 2010, the U.S. EPA issued final regulations relating to these provisions of the Clean Air Act for major stationary sources of GHG emissions that apply to new
sources that emit greater than 100,000 tons per year, on a CO   2    equivalent basis,
and to modifications to existing sources that result in emissions increases greater than 75,000 tons per year on a CO   2    equivalent basis. These thresholds became effective January 2, 2011, apply for six years and will be reviewed by the U.S. EPA for future applicability thereafter. Under the regulations, new and modified major
stationary sources could be required to install best available control technology, to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Exelon could be significantly affected by the regulations if it were to build new plants or modify existing plants.
             Notices and Finding of Violations Related to Electric
Generation Stations.   On August 6, 2007, ComEd received an NOV, addressed to it and Midwest Generation, LLC (Midwest Generation) from the U.S. EPA, alleging that ComEd and Midwest Generation have violated and are continuing to
violate several provisions of the Clean Air Act as a result of the modification and/or operation of six electric generation stations located in northern Illinois that have been owned and operated by Midwest Generation since 1999. The U.S. EPA
requested information related to the stations in 2003, and ComEd has been cooperating with the U.S. EPA since then. The NOV states that the U.S. EPA may issue an order requiring compliance with the relevant Clean Air Act provisions and may seek
injunctive relief and/or civil penalties, all pursuant to the U.S. EPA s enforcement authority under the Clean Air Act.         
  The generating stations that are the subject of the NOV are currently owned and operated by Midwest Generation, which purchased the stations in
December 1999 from ComEd. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Midwest Generation and its affiliate, Edison Mission Energy (EME), assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities associated with the ownership, occupancy, use and operation of
the stations, including responsibility for compliance of the stations with environmental laws before the purchase of the stations by Midwest Generation. Midwest Generation and EME additionally agreed to indemnify and hold ComEd and its affiliates
harmless from claims, fines, penalties, liabilities and expenses arising from third party claims against ComEd resulting from or arising out of the environmental liabilities assumed by Midwest Generation and EME under the terms of the agreement
governing the sale.            In August 2009, the DOJ and the
Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint against Midwest Generation with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois initiating enforcement proceedings with respect to the alleged Clean Air Act violations set forth in the
NOV. Neither ComEd   
         305

nor Exelon were named as a defendant in this original complaint. In March 2010, the District Court granted Midwest Generation s partial motion to dismiss all but one
of the claims against Midwest Generation. The Court held that Midwest Generation cannot be liable for any alleged violations relating to construction that occurred prior to Midwest Generation s ownership of the stations. In May 2010, the
government plaintiffs filed an amended complaint substantially similar to the original complaint, and added ComEd and EME as defendants. The amended complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties against all defendants, although not all of
the claims specifically pertain to ComEd. On September 17, 2010, ComEd filed a motion requesting the Court to dismiss the governmental plaintiffs  amended complaint. On November 16, 2010, the government filed its response to ComEd s
motion to dismiss, and ComEd filed its reply to the government s response on December 17, 2010. The Court has not yet ruled on that motion.         
  In connection with Exelon s 2001 corporate restructuring, Generation assumed ComEd s rights and obligations with respect to its former
generation business. Exelon, Generation and ComEd are unable to predict the ultimate resolution of the claims alleged in the amended complaint, the costs that might be incurred or the amount of indemnity that may be available from Midwest Generation
and EME; however, Exelon, Generation and ComEd have concluded that, while a loss may be reasonably possible, they believe the likelihood of loss is not probable. Therefore, no reserve has been established. Further, Generation believes that it would
be reimbursed for any losses under the terms of the indemnification agreement, subject to the credit worthiness of Midwest Generation and EME. Exelon, Generation and ComEd cannot predict an estimated amount or range of possible loss.   
         Litigation and Regulatory Matters    
          Exelon and Generation     
          Real Estate Tax Appeals.   On January 19, 2010,
Generation appealed to the LaSalle County Board of Review the real estate tax assessment for the 2009 tax year concerning the value of its LaSalle Generating Station (LaSalle County, Illinois)(LaSalle), and on December 6, 2010, Generation
appealed the real estate tax assessment for LaSalle for the 2010 tax year. Generation recorded the assessed real estate taxes as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and paid the 2009 taxes, as assessed, to the taxing authorities. The appeal for
LaSalle for the 2009 tax year continues at the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board. Generation does not anticipate a decision in the 2009 tax appeal for several years due to backlog at the Appeal Board. The ultimate outcome of both of these matters
is uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the outcome could result in unfavorable or favorable impacts to the consolidated financial statements of Exelon and Generation.   
          Exelon and Generation     
          Asbestos Personal Injury Claims.   Generation maintains a
reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The reserve is recorded on an undiscounted basis and excludes the
estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.            At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Generation had reserved approximately $53 million and $49 million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2010, approximately
$16 million of this amount related to 181 open claims presented to Generation, while the remaining $37 million of the reserve is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2050 based on actuarial
assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether an adjustment
  
         306   

Table of Contents  

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

to the reserve is necessary. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the updates to this reserve, including the extension of future claims to be considered from 2030 to 2050 in the second quarter of 2008,
did not result in material adjustments.              Exelon
               Pension Claims.     On
July 11, 2006, a former employee of ComEd filed a purported class action lawsuit against the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan (Plan) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleged that the
Plan, which covers certain management employees of Exelon s subsidiaries, calculated lump sum distributions in a manner that does not comply with ERISA. The plaintiff sought compensatory relief from the Plan on behalf of participants who
received lump sum distributions between 2001 and 2006 and injunctive relief with respect to future lump sum distributions. The District Court dismissed the lawsuit but allowed the plaintiff to file an administrative claim with the Plan with respect
to the calculation of the portion of his lump sum benefit accrued under the Plan s prior traditional formula. On July 2, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court s ruling, and the
plaintiff s subsequent motion requesting rehearing of the case before the entire Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was denied. On October 28, 2009, the plaintiff filed a petition requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court hear an appeal of the
Seventh Circuit s decision. On February 22, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. In addition, on January 6, 2009, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the District Court challenging the Plan s denial of his
administrative claim, and on November 12, 2010, the District Court granted the Plan s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff s remaining claims with prejudice. The plaintiff did not appeal the dismissal of his
remaining claims.              Savings Plan Claim.   On
September 11, 2006, five individuals claiming to be participants in the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan, Plan #003 (Savings Plan), filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
The complaint names as defendants Exelon, its Director of Employee Benefit Plans and Programs, the Employee Savings Plan Investment Committee, the Compensation and the Risk Oversight Committees of Exelon s Board of Directors and members of
those committees. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached fiduciary duties under ERISA by, among other things, permitting fees and expenses to be incurred by the Savings Plan that allegedly were unreasonable and for purposes other than to
benefit the Savings Plan and participants, and failing to disclose purported  revenue sharing  arrangements among the Savings Plan s service providers. The plaintiffs sought declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the
Savings Plan and participants, including alleged investment losses. On August 19, 2009, the plaintiffs in the Exelon case filed an amended complaint in the District Court, which again alleged that defendants breached fiduciary duties under
ERISA by, among other things, permitting the Savings Plan to pay excessive fees and expenses for administrative services, but eliminated the claim for investment losses and the allegations regarding  revenue sharing.  On December 9,
2009, the District Court granted the defendants  motion to dismiss the amended complaint and enter judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed the District Court s dismissal of their claims to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, where the matter remains pending. The ultimate outcome of the savings plan claim is uncertain and may have a material impact on Exelon s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   
          General.     The Registrants are involved in
various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The Registrants maintain accruals for such costs that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. The Registrants will
record a

receivable if they expect to recover costs for these contingencies. The ultimate outcomes of such matters, as well as the matters discussed above, are uncertain and may have a material adverse
impact on the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows or financial positions.             Fund Transfer Restrictions             Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money
pool.            The Federal Power Act declares it to be unlawful for
any officer or director of any public utility  to participate in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.  What constitutes  funds properly included in capital
account  is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the
dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. While these restrictions may limit the absolute amount of dividends that a particular subsidiary may pay, Exelon does not believe these limitations
are materially limiting because, under these limitations, the subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends sufficient to meet Exelon s actual cash needs.         
  Under Illinois law, ComEd may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things,  [its] earnings and earned surplus are sufficient
to declare and pay same after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves,  or unless it has specific authorization from the ICC. ComEd has also agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not
declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee
of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued.   
        PECO s Articles of Incorporation prohibit payment of any dividend
on, or other distribution to the holders of, common stock if, after giving effect thereto, the capital of PECO represented by its common stock together with its retained earnings is, in the aggregate, less than the involuntary liquidating value of
its then outstanding preferred securities. At December 31, 2010, such capital was $2.9 billion and amounted to about 33 times the liquidating value of the outstanding preferred securities of $87 million. Additionally, PECO may not declare
dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its
guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are
issued.             Income Taxes

Matters for additional information regarding the accounting for the DOE SGIG.             Repurchase Agreements (Exelon and Generation).  Repurchase Agreements are financial instruments used to fund short-term liquidity requirements where a counterparty typically agrees to sell the financial
instrument and repurchase it the following day. Exelon and Generation have historically presented purchases and sales of Repurchase Agreements with a maturity of three months or less on a gross basis in  Investments in NDT funds and
 Proceeds from NDT fund sales , respectively, within Exelon and Generation s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Due to the nature and volume of these transactions, effective December 31, 2010, Exelon and Generation have
included the cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of Repurchase Agreements with a maturity of three months or less on a net basis in  Proceeds from NDT fund sales  within their Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows
associated with all other NDT funds investments will continue to be presented on a gross basis. The years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were adjusted to reflect this change in presentation, which is presented in the following table:

preliminary agreement to settle Exelon s involuntary conversion and CTC positions. In order to stop additional interest from accruing on the expected assessment resulting from the agreement, Exelon paid $302 million to the IRS on
December 28, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, Exelon had not funded the specific bank account from which the IRS payment was disbursed resulting in a current liability. This amount was subsequently funded in January 2011. Under the
authoritative guidance for offsetting balances, Exelon included this payment in Cash and cash equivalents with an offsetting amount in Other current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11 Income Taxes for additional
information.

    Like-Kind Exchange Transaction (Exelon).  Prior to the PECO/Unicom Merger in October 2000,
UII, LLC (formerly Unicom Investments, Inc.) (UII), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon, entered into a like-kind exchange transaction pursuant to which approximately $1.6 billion was invested in passive generating station leases with two separate
entities unrelated to Exelon. The generating stations were leased back to such entities as part of the transaction. For financial accounting purposes, the investments are accounted for as direct financing lease investments. UII holds the leasehold
interests in the generating stations in several separate bankruptcy remote, special purpose companies it directly or indirectly wholly owns. The lease agreements provide the lessees with fixed purchase options at the end of the lease terms. If the
lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options, Exelon has the ability to require the lessees to return the leasehold interests or to arrange a service contract with a third party for a period following the lease term. If Exelon chooses the
service contract option, the leasehold interests will be returned to Exelon at the end of the term of the service contract. In any event, Exelon will be subject to residual value risk if the lessees do not exercise the fixed purchase options. In the
fourth quarter of 2000, under the terms of the lease agreements, UII received a prepayment of $1.2 billion for all rent, which reduced the investment in the leases. There are no minimum scheduled lease payments to be received over the remaining term
of the leases. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the components of the net investment in long-term leases were as follows:         
          The following tables provide additional

Exelon s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:         
             20. Segment Information
(Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO)             During the first
quarter of 2010, Exelon and Generation concluded that Generation no longer operates as a single reportable segment, primarily due to a change in the financial information regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) in
determining resource allocation and assessing performance. Certain regional results of Generation s power marketing activities are now being provided to the CODM and in other public disclosures. As a result, Generation had three reportable
segments, the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South, representing the different geographical areas in which Generation s power marketing activities are conducted. As a result of the acquisition of Exelon Wind during the fourth quarter of 2010,
Generation adjusted its South reportable segment to include recently acquired assets located in the South and West geographical areas, forming the South and West reportable segment. In addition, the Exelon Wind assets located in the Midwest
geographical area are included within the Midwest reportable segment. Consequently, Exelon has five reportable segments consisting of Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, South and West, ComEd and PECO.            Mid-Atlantic represents Generation s operations primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland; Midwest includes
the operations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota; and the South and West includes operations primarily in Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Idaho and Oregon. Generation s retail gas, proprietary trading, other revenues and
mark to market activities have not been allocated to a segment.            Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation s power marketing activities in Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and South and West based on revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense. Generation
believes that revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is a useful measurement of operational performance. Revenue net of purchased power and fuel expense is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other
companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to ComEd and PECO. Purchased power costs
include all costs associated with the procurement of electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for internally generated energy and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements.
Generation s retail gas, proprietary trading, other revenue and mark-to-market activities are not allocated to a segment. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or
assessing the performance of these reportable segments.

   ComEd and PECO each represent a single reportable segment; as such, no separate segment
information is provided for these Registrants. PECO has two operating segments, electric and gas delivery, which are aggregated into one reportable segment primarily due to their similar economic characteristics and the regulatory environments in
which they operate. Exelon evaluates the performance of ComEd and PECO based on net income.            An analysis and reconciliation of the Registrants  reportable segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial statements as follows:

Generation s reportable segments which would result in intersegment revenue for Generation.     

(b)  
  Includes retail gas, proprietary trading, other revenue and mark-to-market activities as well as amounts paid related to the Illinois Settlement Legislation.

   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

ITEM 9A.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES            
           Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO    
        During the fourth quarter of 2010, each registrant s management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated that registrant s disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of information in that registrant s
periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to
be included in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that registrant
and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.         
  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such
registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives. Each registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to
maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Exelon s internal control over financial reporting.         
   Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO          
  Management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. As a
result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2010 and, therefore, concluded that each registrant s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

best group of electric generation and electric and gas delivery companies in the United States, providing superior value for Exelon s customers, employees, investors and the communities Exelon serves. The compensation committee has adopted a
pay-for-performance philosophy, which places an emphasis on pay-at-risk. Exelon s compensation program is designed to reward superior performance, that is, meeting or exceeding financial and operational goals set by the compensation committee.
When excellent performance is achieved, pay will increase. Failure to achieve the target goals established by the compensation committee will result in lower pay.   
         Reductions in Compensation for 2010    
        After a difficult year for earnings in 2009, and in anticipation of
continued earnings challenges in 2010, the compensation committee and the Exelon and ComEd boards of directors took the following actions at the beginning of 2010 to reduce compensation:         

Executive salaries were frozen, except for changes in responsibilities;      

The annual incentive program ( AIP ) payout scale was recalibrated to reduce the threshold payout from 50% to 25% and to reduce the payout at plan from
100% to 50%, while leaving distinguished payout at 200%;            

The shareholder protection features in the annual incentive plan were enhanced by limiting key performance indicator payouts to no more than 10% above the
earnings payout percentage;            

The target values for long-term incentives were reduced by approximately 33%; and            

The company fixed match on 401(k) contributions was reduced from 5% to 3% of base salary, with the potential for a formula-based profit sharing contribution of
up to an additional 3% of base salary.            
   Effect of Financial Performance on Incentive Compensation    
        Exelon s results for 2010 as compared to 2008 and 2009
demonstrate that Exelon s incentive compensation is consistent with Exelon s performance.            Exelon s AIP is based to a significant extent on adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share. After Exelon s earnings in 2009 declined to 97% of target, Exelon s original guidance for 2010 for
adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings was a range of $3.60 to $4.00, and the plan, for a 50% payout, was $3.70 and target, for a 100% payout, was $3.90. During the year, the lower end of the guidance range was increased to $3.70 on April 23,
2010. The guidance range was raised on July 22, 2010 to $3.80 to $4.10 per share, and raised again on October 22, 2010 to $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Actual adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings as reported in Exelon s earnings release
on January 26, 2011 were $4.06. However, the compensation committee decided, for purposes of calculating earnings for the AIP, that the increase in income tax expense pursuant to lower manufacturer s tax deductions as a result of the
decision to contribute $2.1 billion to Exelon s pension funds should not be taken into account in determining the incentive pool. The committee wished to provide an incentive to management to make financial decisions that will benefit the
company in the long run, even if they reduce earnings in the short run. This decision raised earnings for AIP purposes to $4.11 per share, or 152.5% of target. Accordingly, AIP payouts for 2010 were higher than in 2009 or
  
         340

2008. However, because earnings were below 150% of target in 2008, below target in 2009, and below distinguished in 2010, the shareholder protection features in the annual incentive plan took
effect and limited some or all of the AIP payouts on operating company/business unit key performance indicator goals.         
  Exelon s performance share award program is based on the relative total shareholder return for Exelon as compared to the
Dow Jones Utility Index (60%) and the Standard   Poor s 500 Index (40%). Total shareholder return for the 2006-2008 performance period was at the 75   th    percentile of the Dow Jones Utility Index and the 85.6   th    percentile of the Standard   Poor s 500 Index, resulting in performance share payouts at the distinguished (200%
of target) level for 2008. However, Exelon s total shareholder return for the 2007-2009 performance period was at the 37.5 percentile of the Dow Jones Utility Index and the 49.5 percentile of the Standard   Poor s 500 Index,
resulting in a below target payout at 84.6% of target. In the 2007-2010 performance period, Exelon s total shareholder return was at the 8.3 percentile of the Dow Jones Utility Index and the 13.7 percentile of the Standard  
Poor s 500 Index, resulting in a zero payout.            The
following table shows the correlation between levels of financial performance and incentive compensation in 2008, 2009 and 2010:         
          For additional information about Exelon s financial results for 2009 and 2010, see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
         Value of Compensation Actually Paid to Named Executive Officers
            The valuation methods specified by the SEC rules for
equity compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table overstate the value of equity compensation in Exelon s situation. 2010 grant date fair value for performance share units for the 2008-2010 performance period is overstated because
no performance shares were awarded. 2009 grant date fair value for performance share units for the 2007-2009 performance period is based in part on historical data for the previous two plan years, which resulted in a high valuation due to strong
performance in the 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 performance periods (when Exelon s performance share program paid out at 184.9% of target and 200% of target, respectively, resulting in a valuation at 161% of target for the 2007-2009 performance
period). The actual value of the 2007-2009 performance shares granted in January 2009 and awarded in January 2010 was significantly lower, reflecting both the actual performance at the award date and the decline in the stock price between the grant
date and the award date. Similarly, the target number of performance shares for the 2006-2008 performance period was based on the January 2008 stock price of approximately $73, while the shares awarded in January 2009 were worth approximately $57.
As a result, while Exelon s total shareholder return performance was at 200% of target, the value of the shares paid out was only about 153% of the target value. In addition, valuation of stock options in the Summary Compensation Table is
overstated to the extent that the strike price of stock options is higher than the current price of Exelon s stock. None of the stock options granted since January 2006 is in the money; the 2006 strike price was $58.55; 2007, $59.96; 2008,
$73.29; 2009, $56.51; and 2010, $46.09, while the price of Exelon s common stock on January 24, 2011 was $43.40.   
         341   

Table of Contents  

   The following table presents the compensation actually paid to Exelon s named executive officers
(NEOs). Values for non-equity compensation are the same as in the Summary Compensation Table. Equity compensation is valued using the actual number of performance shares awarded at the end of the performance period multiplied by the stock price on
the award date and no value for stock options that are not in the money, instead of grant date fair values.         
  For most NEOs, the compensation they actually received in 2010 was lower than in 2009 or 2008. This reflects the zero payout of performance shares
and the ComEd long term incentive program in 2010, offset by increased AIP compensation in 2010 because Exelon s earnings were higher relative to expectations at the beginning of the year in 2010 than in 2009 and 2008. In addition,
Mr. Rowe s compensation increased because of the increase in the change in the present value of his pension. Exelon is required to disclose the difference between the present value of pension benefits at the end of the year as compared to
the present value at the end of the preceding year. This figure can be volatile depending on changes in the pension accounting disclosure assumptions. For 2010, the increase in the present value of Mr. Rowe s pension resulted from the
increase in the average of his highest four year annual compensation (7.5%), a decrease in the discount rate (8.8%), and his additional year of service (3.1%), partially offset by the increase in his age (-2.5%). In contrast, for 2009 the increase
in the average of his highest four year annual compensation was approximately 1% and the change in the discount rate increased the present value factors by less than 0.5%.

           Elimination of Future Excise Tax Gross-ups on Termination Payments and Certain Perquisites          
  While the compensation committee and the Exelon and ComEd boards of directors took actions to reduce compensation in 2010, the compensation
committee had previously taken actions to reduce severance payments and certain perquisites. In April 2009, the compensation committee adopted a policy that future employment or severance agreements that provide for benefits for NEOs on account of
termination will not include an excise tax gross-up. The policy is more fully described below under Other Benefits  Change In Control and Severance Benefits.  On October 27, 2009, the board of directors approved the Third Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Rowe. In the agreement, Mr. Rowe s previous excise tax gross-up benefit was eliminated consistent with the policy. The agreement is more fully described below under Potential Payments upon
Termination or Change in Control Employment Agreement with Mr. Rowe. Anticipating an emerging trend among the peer group to curtail perquisite programs in the future, on January 22, 2007, the compensation committee approved the
phase-out of many executive perquisites, effective January 1, 2008. The eliminated perquisites included: leased vehicles (existing leases allowed to expire), financial and estate planning, tax preparation and health and dining/airline club
memberships.             Recoupment Policy    
        As described more fully below, in May 2007, the board of directors
adopted a recoupment policy as part of Exelon s corporate governance principles that provides that the board may in its discretion seek recoupment of incentive compensation from an executive officer in the event of fraud or intentional
misconduct resulting in a restatement of financial results and the payment of more incentive compensation than would have been earned.

    Stock Ownership and Trading Requirements    
        To strengthen the alignment of executives  interests with
shareholders, officers of Exelon and its subsidiaries (other than ComEd) are required to own certain amounts of Exelon stock. Executive vice presidents and above may only sell Exelon stock through a Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plan. The use of stock
trading plans permits diversification as a part of retirement and tax planning activities while reducing the risk that investors will view such sales as a signal of negative expectations for Exelon s future stock value. Additional information
is below and in the Stock Ownership Guidelines section in Item 12 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and related Stockholder Matters.   
         Changes to Incentive Compensation Programs for 2011    
        In January 2011 the compensation committee established the incentive
compensation programs for 2011, including changes from the 2010 design. The 2011 AIP is structured substantially similar to the 2010 AIP, except that the payout scale has been restored to pay 50% at threshold and 100% at plan, and the shareholder
protection feature has been changed to limit key performance indicator payouts to no more than 20 percentage points above the earnings payout percentage. The 2011ComEd AIP is substantially similar to the 2010 ComEd AIP, except that the net income
limiter has been restructured to limit key performance indicator payouts to no more than 20 percentage points above the operating net income performance.         
  The long-term incentive program was also changed in 2011. The compensation committee was concerned about the volatility in the payouts (which ranged
from 200% for the 2006-2008 performance period to 0% for the 2008-2010 performance period). The compensation committee was also concerned about the lack of alignment between total shareholder return and operational and financial performance due to
factors beyond management s control, such as low energy prices. It did not want to perpetuate an incentive structure that would fail to reward outstanding operational and financial performance. The compensation committee believed it would be
prudent to restructure the long term incentive program to reward the achievement of operational and financial performance with respect to factors that are largely within management s control. Accordingly, both the goals and the mix of long-term
incentives were changed. Only officers, senior vice president and above, will continue to receive awards of stock options, reflecting their ability to make decisions with the potential for long term increases in shareholder value. Such officers will
continue to receive 25% of their targeted long-term incentive opportunity in the form of stock options and 75% in the form of performance shares. Vice presidents will have their targeted long-term incentive opportunity reallocated to come 50% from
performance shares and 50% from time-vested restricted stock. In connection with the realignment of goals and the changes in the mix of long-term incentives, the compensation committee determined that it would be advisable to reduce the maximum
payout for performance shares from 200% of target to 125% of target, while raising the payout at threshold from 50% to 75%.         
  The specific goals for the performance share award program for 2011 have been changed from the exclusive reliance on comparative total shareholder
return measures previously used to a qualitative assessment by the compensation committee of performance against six goals reflecting actions and initiatives enhancing the long-term value of the company. These goals include the following:

Operational excellence, delivering low cost, clean and reliable energy and operating our facilities safely;      

Financial management, executing cost discipline and optimizing the balance sheet, cash flow, liquidity, and liability management to deliver value return;
     
         345   

Table of Contents  

Policy advocacy, engaging with stakeholders to shape public policy to benefit shareholders and consumers;      

Participating in industry consolidation only when the time and price are right;            

Organic growth, creating commercial opportunities that leverage Exelon s unique investment platform, such as the nuclear uprate program; and

Protecting shareholder and bondholder value through active risk management.               Total shareholder return data will continue to be provided to the compensation committee as a factor that will be taken into account in
making the final payout decisions. The total shareholder return data will compare Exelon to a group of nine utilities with more than 25% unregulated generation.         
  The compensation committee also approved two changes to the terms of performance shares. First, there will be a restriction on the sale of any
performance shares from a grant for a senior vice president or above until all of the shares from the grant have vested three years after the grant date. Second, all awards will be settled in shares, ending the current practice of settling
performance shares in cash if the officer has achieved certain stock ownership thresholds. These changes are intended to further align the interests of recipients with shareholders by increasing the amount of incentive compensation paid in stock and
by requiring senior officers to hold the stock for a longer period of time.            The ComEd 2011 long term incentive program is substantially similar to the 2010 program.         
   Objectives of the Compensation Program          
  The compensation committee has designed Exelon s executive compensation program to motivate and reward senior management for achieving
financial, operational and strategic success consistent with Exelon s vision of being the best group of electric generation and electric and gas delivery companies in the United States, providing superior value for Exelon s customers,
employees, investors and the communities Exelon serves. The compensation programs are also designed to attract and retain outstanding executives. Exelon s compensation program has three principles, as described below:   
         1. A substantial portion of compensation should be performance-based.
            The compensation committee has adopted a
pay-for-performance philosophy, which places an emphasis on pay-at-risk. Exelon s compensation program is designed to reward superior performance, that is, meeting or exceeding financial and operational goals set by the compensation committee.
When excellent performance is achieved, pay will increase. Failure to achieve the target goals established by the compensation committee will result in lower pay. There are pay-for-performance features in both cash and equity-based compensation. The
NEOs listed in the Summary Compensation Table participate in an annual incentive plan that provides cash compensation based on the achievement of performance goals established each year by the compensation committee. A substantial portion of each
NEO s equity-based compensation is in the form of performance share units that are paid to the extent that longer-range performance goals set by the compensation committee are met, with the balance delivered in stock options that have value
only to the extent that Exelon s stock price increases following the option grant date. As a result of the performance-based features of his cash and equity-based compensation, 77% of Mr. Rowe s 2010 target total direct compensation
(base salary plus annual and long-term incentive compensation) was at-risk. Similarly, of the other NEOs  2010 target total direct compensation, approximately 44% to 71% was at-risk.   
         346   

Table of Contents  

    Recoupment Policy          
  Consistent with the pay-for-performance policy, in May 2007, the board of directors adopted a recoupment policy as part of Exelon s corporate
governance principles. The board of directors will seek recoupment of incentive compensation paid to an executive officer if the board determines, in its sole discretion, that   

the executive officer engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct;      

as a result of which Exelon was required to materially restate its financial results;            

the executive officer was paid more incentive compensation than would have been payable had the financial results been as restated;      

recoupment is not precluded by applicable law or employment agreements; and            

the board concludes that, under the facts and circumstances, seeking recoupment would be in the best interest of Exelon and its shareholders.
               2. A substantial portion of compensation should be
granted as equity-based awards.             The compensation
committee believes that a substantial portion of compensation should be in the form of equity-based awards in order to align the interests of the NEOs with Exelon s shareholders. The objective is to make the NEOs think and act like owners.
Equity-based compensation is in the form of performance share units, stock options, and restricted stock units that are valued in relation to Exelon s common stock, and they gain value in relation to the market price of Exelon s stock or
Exelon s total shareholder return in comparison to other energy services companies and/or general industry. Conversely, when the market price of Exelon s stock decreases, the value of the equity compensation decreases.   
         3. Exelon s compensation program should enable the company to compete for and
retain outstanding executive talent.          
  Exelon s shareholders are best served when we can successfully recruit and retain talented executives with compensation
that is competitive and fair. The compensation committee strives to deliver total direct compensation generally at the median (the
50   th    percentile), which is deemed to be the competitive level of pay of
executives in comparable positions at certain peer companies with which we compete for executive talent. If Exelon s performance is at target, the compensation will be targeted at the 50   th    percentile; if Exelon s performance is above target, the compensation will be targeted above the 50   th    percentile, and if performance is below target, the compensation will be targeted below
the 50   th    percentile. This concept reinforces the pay-for-performance
philosophy.            Each year the compensation committee
commissions its consultant to prepare a study to benchmark total direct compensation against a peer group of companies. The study includes an assessment of competitive compensation levels at high-performing energy services companies and other large,
capital asset-intensive companies in general industry, since the company competes for executive talent with companies in both groups. All competitive data was aged to January 2010 using a 2.7% annual update factor. The study indicated that base
salaries were flat on average, with some positions up or down slightly, target annual incentives up modestly and target long-term incentives down 5% on a year- over-year basis, and that no changes were needed for the long-term incentive mix and
design. The consultant considered Exelon s organization to determine how Exelon s positions compared with positions at its peers by establishing a benchmark match for each Exelon executive in the competitive market, where available, and
data for positions matched to business-unit level jobs were size adjusted using regression analysis, where available. The study reviewed each element of compensation as well as total direct compensation.   
         347

   The peer group criteria include three primary factors:   

having revenue similar to Exelon s $17 billion,            

having market capitalization generally greater than $5 billion, and      

a balance of industry segments.            
  The members of the peer group are reviewed each year to determine whether their inclusion continues to be appropriate. Generally the peer group is comprised of 24
companies: 12 general industry companies and 12 energy services companies. The companies were selected by the compensation committee from the Towers Perrin Energy Services Industry Executive Compensation Database and their Executive Compensation
Database. The peer group was the same in 2010 as it was in 2009. The peer group includes the following companies:         
          The compensation committee generally applies the same policies with respect to the compensation of each of the individual NEOs. The compensation committee carefully considers the roles and responsibilities of each
of the NEOs relative to the peer group, as well as the individual s performance and contribution to the performance of the business in establishing the compensation opportunity for each NEO. The differences in the amounts of compensation
awarded to the NEOs reflect primarily two factors, the differences in the compensation paid to officers in comparable positions in the peer group and differences in the individual responsibility and experience of the Exelon officers. Time in
position affects where individuals are relative to market percentiles, with cash compensation generally at the median and incentive compensation slightly above the median. The   
         348   

Table of Contents  

nuclear organization s pay is generally closer to the 75   th    percentile given the size and quality of Exelon s nuclear fleet, and certain positions are at the 75   th    percentile because of unusual expertise in regulatory or nuclear matters. The delivery company presidents were evaluated as a
blend of top energy delivery executives and freestanding CEOs, given the amount of independence they have. Mr. Rowe s target compensation was based on the same factors as the other NEOs, but his compensation reflected a greater degree of
policy and decision-making authority and a higher level of responsibility with respect to strategic direction and financial and operating results of Exelon. His target compensation was assessed relative to other CEOs in the peer group.
Mr. Rowe s compensation also reflects the fact that Exelon has the second largest market capitalization and the largest nuclear fleet in the industry. It also reflects that Mr. Rowe is the senior CEO in the industry.   
         The role of individual performance in setting compensation    
        While the consideration of benchmarking data to assure that
Exelon s compensation is competitive is a critical component of compensation decisions, individual performance is factored into the setting of compensation in three ways:   

First, base salary adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual s performance in the preceding year as well as a comparison with market data for
comparable positions in the peer group.            

Second, annual incentive targets are based on the individual s role in the enterprise the most senior officers with responsibilities that span specific
business units or functions have a target based on earnings per share for the company as a whole, while individuals with specific functional or business unit responsibilities have a significant portion of their targets based on the performance of
that functional or business unit.            

Third, consideration is given as to whether an individual performance multiplier would be appropriately applied to the individual s annual incentive plan
award, based on the individual s performance. The individual performance multiplier can result in a decision not to make an award or to decrease the amount of the award or to increase the amount of the award by up to 10% so long as the adjusted
award does not exceed the maximum amount that could be paid to the executive based on achievement of the objective performance criteria applicable under the plan.      
         Elements of Compensation    
        This section is an overview of our compensation program for NEOs. It
describes the various elements and discusses matters relating to those items, including why the compensation committee chooses to include items in the compensation program. The next section describes how 2010 compensation was determined and awarded
to the NEOs.            Exelon s executive compensation program
is comprised of four elements: base salary; annual incentives; long-term incentives; and other benefits.         
  Cash compensation is comprised of base salary and annual incentives. Equity compensation is delivered through long-term incentives. Together, these
elements are designed to balance short-term and longer-range business objectives and to align NEOs  financial rewards with shareholders  interests. For all NEOs other than those at ComEd, approximately 48% to 76% of NEOs  total target
direct compensation is delivered in the form of cash and equity compensation accounts for approximately 24% to 52% of NEO total target direct compensation. For ComEd NEOs, all total target direct compensation is delivered in the form of cash and
there is no equity component, consistent with continuing efforts to recognize ComEd s independence and to maximize recovery in rates. The range   
         349   

Table of Contents  

in the mix of cash and equity compensation is consistent with competitive compensation practices among companies in the peer group. The compensation committee believes that this mix of cash and
equity compensation strikes the right balance of incentives to pursue specific short and long-term performance goals that drive shareholder value.         
   Base Salary          
  Exelon s compensation program for NEOs is designed so that approximately 23% to 56% of NEO total direct compensation is in the form of base
salary, consistent with practices at the companies in the peer group.         
   Annual Incentives          
  Annual incentive compensation is designed to provide incentives for achieving short-term financial and operational goals for the company as a whole,
and for subsidiaries, individual business units and operating groups, as appropriate. Under the annual incentive program, cash awards are made to NEOs and other employees if, and only to the extent that, performance conditions set by the
compensation committee are met.             Long-term Incentives    
        Long-term incentives are made available to executives and key
management employees who affect the long-term success of the company. The long-term incentive compensation programs are primarily equity based and designed to provide incentives and rewards closely related to the interests of Exelon s
shareholders, generally as measured by the performance of Exelon s total shareholder return and stock price appreciation.         
  A portion of the long-term incentive compensation is in the form of performance share units that are awarded only to the extent that performance
conditions established by the compensation committee are met. The balance of long-term incentive compensation is in the form of time-vested stock options that provide value only if, and to the extent that, the market price of Exelon s common
stock increases following the grant. The use of both forms of long-term incentives is consistent with the practices in our peer group. The mix of long-term incentives depends on the compensation committee s assessment of competitive
compensation practices of companies in the peer group.         
  Stock option repricing is prohibited by policy or the terms of the company s long-term incentive plans. Accordingly, no options have been
repriced. Stock option awards are generally granted annually at the regularly scheduled January compensation committee meeting when the committee reviews results for the preceding year and establishes the compensation program for the coming year.
There were no off-cycle grants of stock options made in 2010.         
  In 2007, consistent with the continuing efforts to recognize ComEd s independence, the compensation committee recommended, and the ComEd board
adopted, a separate long-term incentive program for ComEd s executives. The goals under the ComEd 2010-2012 long-term incentive program are the achievement of goals relating to total cost, outage duration and frequency and safety, operational
performance, employee engagement and communication, and environmental commitments. Payments under this plan are made in cash, and are awarded annually by the ComEd board based on the assessment of performance during the year and the recommendation
of the Exelon compensation committee. Because compensation above target is not recoverable in rates, any payout above 100% will be consistent with Exelon long-term incentive compensation levels. In addition, payouts may be modified at the discretion
of the ComEd Chairman and CEO and the board of directors based on overall performance of the company and the prevailing economic environment at the time of the award. Other features of the program are similar to the Exelon performance share award
program, including the payout of awards ranging from 0-200% of target and vesting over three years.

    Executive stock ownership and trading requirements             To strengthen the alignment of executives  interests with those of shareholders, officers of the company are
required to own certain amounts of Exelon common stock by the later of five years after their employment or promotion to their current position. However, in 2007, the compensation committee terminated the stock ownership requirements for ComEd
officers in light of the continuing efforts to recognize ComEd s independence and the compensation committee s recommendation that ComEd officers participate in a separate cash-based long-term incentive program instead of receiving Exelon
performance shares. For additional information about Exelon s stock ownership guidelines, please see the Stock Ownership Guidelines section in Item 12 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related
Stockholder Matters.            Exelon has adopted a policy requiring
officers, executive vice presidents and above, who wish to sell Exelon common stock to do so only through Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans, and permitting other officers to enter into such plans. This requirement is designed to enable officers to
diversify a portion of their holdings in excess of the applicable stock ownership requirements in an orderly manner as part of their retirement and tax planning activities. The use of Section 10b5-1 stock trading plans serves to reduce the risk
that investors will view routine portfolio diversification stock sales by executive officers as a signal of negative expectations with respect to the future value of Exelon s stock. In addition, the use of Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans
reduces the potential for accusations of trading on the basis of material, non-public information that could damage the reputation of the company. Two of the NEOs have such plans, and their exercises during 2010 are reflected in the  Option
Exercises and Stock Vested  table below. Exelon s stock trading policy does not permit short sales or hedging.         
   Other Benefits          
  Other benefits offered by Exelon include such things as qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation programs, post-termination compensation,
retirement benefit plans and perquisites. The company also provides other benefits such as medical and dental coverage and life insurance to each NEO to generally the same extent as such benefits are provided to other Exelon employees, except that
executives pay a higher percentage of their total medical premium. These benefits are intended to make our executives more efficient and effective and provide for their health, well-being and retirement planning needs. The compensation committee
reviews these other benefits to confirm that they are reasonable and competitive in light of the overall goal of designing the compensation program to attract and retain talent while maximizing the interests of our shareholders.   
         Change In Control and Severance Benefits    
        The compensation committee believes that change in control employment
agreements and severance benefits are an important part of Exelon s compensation structure for NEOs. The compensation committee believes that these agreements will help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the NEOs to continue
to work in the best interests of shareholders, notwithstanding any concern they might have regarding their own continued employment prior to or following a change in control. The compensation committee also believes that these agreements and the
Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan are important as recruitment and retention devices, as all or nearly all of the companies with which Exelon competes for executive talent have similar protections in place for their senior
leadership.            In 2007, the compensation committee adopted a
policy limiting the amount of future severance benefits to be paid to NEOs under future arrangements without shareholder approval to 2.99 times salary plus annual incentive. This policy clarifies that severance benefits include cash severance
payments and other post-employment benefits and perquisites, but do not include:         

Amounts earned in the ordinary course of employment rather than upon termination, such as pension benefits and retiree medical benefits;
     
         351   

Table of Contents  

Amounts payable under plans approved by shareholders;            

Amounts available to one or more classes of employees other than the NEOs;            

Excise tax gross-up payments, but only if the compensation includable in determining whether excise taxes apply exceed 110% of the threshold amount; otherwise
the NEO s benefits are reduced so that no excise tax is imposed; and            

Amounts that may be required by existing agreements that have not been materially modified, Exelon s indemnification obligations or the reasonable terms of
a settlement agreement.               In April 2008,
the compensation committee reviewed the level of non-change in control severance benefits provided to senior vice presidents. These benefits had varied over time as the corporate organization evolved within a range of 1.25 to 2 times annual salary
and incentive. The compensation consultant reported that 1.5 times annual salary and incentive was more appropriate and consistent with competitive practices. The compensation committee determined that non-change in control severance benefits for
senior vice presidents would be reset at 1.5 times annual salary and bonus, provided that those senior vice presidents with such benefits at 2 times annual salary and bonus would be grandfathered at that level. In December 2008, the individual
change in control employment agreements provided to the NEOs (other than the CEO) and certain other executives were amended to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which requires that certain payments of deferred compensation be
paid not earlier than six months following a termination of employment. In addition, the severance multiple available to executives who entered into such agreements prior to 2007 was reduced from 3.0 to 2.99 times base salary and annual incentive,
consistent with the 2007 compensation committee policy described immediately above, and the board s recoupment policy was incorporated.         
  In April 2009, the compensation committee adopted a policy that no future employment or severance agreement that provides for benefits for NEOs on
account of termination will include an excise tax gross-up. The policy applies to employment, change in control, severance and separation agreements entered into, adopted, or materially changed on or after April 2, 2009, other than agreements
changed to comply with law or to reduce or eliminate rights, agreements assumed in a corporate transaction, and automatic extensions or renewals where other terms are not changed. The compensation committee has the sole and absolute power to
interpret and apply the policy, and it can amend, waive or terminate it if in the best interest of the company, provided that prompt disclosure is made.         
   Retirement Benefit Plans          
  The compensation committee believes that retirement benefit plans are an important part of the NEO compensation program. These plans serve a
critically important role in the retention of senior executives, as retirement benefits increase for each year that these executives remain employed. The plans thereby encourage our most senior executives to remain employed and continue their work
on behalf of the shareholders. Exelon sponsors both qualified traditional defined benefit and cash balance defined benefit pension plans and related non-qualified supplemental pension plans (the SERPs).   
        Exelon previously granted additional years of credited service under
the SERP to a few executives in order to recruit or retain them. As of January 1, 2004, Exelon ceased the practice of granting additional years of credited service to executives under the non-qualified pension plans that supplement the Exelon
Corporation Retirement Program for any period in which services are not actually performed, except that up to two years of service credits may be provided under severance or change in control agreements first entered into after such date. Service
credits available under employment, change in control or severance agreements or arrangements (or any successor arrangements) in effect as of January 1, 2004 were not affected by this policy. To attract a new
  
         352   

Table of Contents  

executive, Exelon is permitted to grant additional years of service under the SERP related to its cash balance pension plan to make the executive whole for retirement benefits lost from another
employer by joining Exelon, provided such a grant is disclosed to shareholders. To date, Exelon has not made any such grant.         
   Perquisites          
  Exelon provides limited perquisites intended to serve specific business needs for the benefit of Exelon; however, it is understood that some may be
used for personal reasons as well. When perquisites are utilized for personal reasons, the cost or value is imputed to the officer as income and the officer is responsible for all applicable taxes; however, in certain cases, the personal benefit is
closely associated with the business purpose in which case the company may reimburse the officer for the taxes due on the imputed income. In 2005, the compensation consultant reviewed Exelon s perquisites program. Although specific data for
Exelon s peer group was not available, the compensation consultant based its analysis on survey data for large energy and general industry companies. The compensation consultant found that Exelon s perquisite program was competitive. The
compensation committee reviewed the costs of the perquisite program and determined the costs to be appropriate for a company of Exelon s size. Since then, many executive perquisites were phased out effective January 1, 2008. The eliminated
perquisites included: leased vehicles (existing leases allowed to expire), financial and estate planning, tax preparation and health and dining/airline club memberships.   
         How The Amount of 2010 Compensation Was Determined    
        This section describes how 2010 compensation was determined and
awarded to the NEOs.            The independent directors of the
Exelon board, on the recommendations of the Exelon corporate governance committee, conducted a thorough review of Mr. Rowe s performance in 2010. The review considered performance requirements in the areas of finance and operations,
strategic planning and implementation, succession planning and organizational goals, communications and external relations, board relations, leadership, and shareholder relations. Mr. Rowe prepared a detailed self-assessment reporting to the
board on his performance during the year with respect to each of the performance requirements. The Exelon board considered the financial highlights of the year and a strategy scorecard that assessed performance against the company s vision and
goals. The factors considered included:         

goals with respect to protecting the current value of the company, including:            

delivering superior operating performance in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, and the environment,      

supporting competitive markets,            

protecting the value of our generation assets, and            

building healthy, self-sustaining delivery companies; as well as      

goals relating to growing long-term value, including:            

organizational improvement,            

advancing an environmental strategy that sets the industry standard for low carbon energy generation and delivery, and      

rigorously evaluating new growth opportunities.      
         353   

Table of Contents  

   The Exelon board considered, in particular, the following results:   

Operational and financial performance that beat the plans set at the beginning of the year, despite low gas prices and the continued effect of the recession;

The average capacity factor of the nuclear generating plants was high, with 2010 being the eighth consecutive year with capacity factor above 93%;

ComEd and PECO turned in strong performance despite intense storm activity, and it appeared that improved storm response led to increased in customer
satisfaction at both companies;            

While operating earnings declined as compared to the prior year, they were much better than was expected at the beginning of 2010 because of better than planned
portfolio position at Generation, better than planned revenue net fuel at PECO, and effective cost management at all of the operating companies;      

Effective performance at PECO resulted in a favorable rate case settlement that closed out the deregulation transition;      

2010 progress in advancing longer-term goals, including:      

progress on the multi-year nuclear uprate strategy, with 101 MW added to date,            

the acquisition of John Deere Renewables (now Exelon Wind) that enabled Exelon to enter the wind generation business and increased value with long-term PPAs in
place, and            

tangible steps to capture value from transmission;            

Progress in talent development, diversity, succession planning, and the corporate culture.      
        The board also considered the regulatory difficulties and adverse
judicial decisions at ComEd and difficulties encountered in advancing the company s environmental strategy, as well as an employee fatality in the supply organization.   
         How base salary was determined    
        At its January 25, 2010 meeting, the compensation committee
determined not to make any annual increases in base salary for the NEOs as part of the initiatives to reduce 2010 compensation expenses that were considered in the fall of 2009.   
        In June 2010 Exelon s executive leadership organizational
structure was reorganized and the compensation committee recommended, and the board of directors approved, compensation adjustments in connection with the additional responsibilities assumed by certain officers as a result of promotions under the
reorganization. These increases were based on the compensation committee s determination that the compensation for these officers in their new roles was not competitive, as evidenced by market comparisons with the peer group prepared by the
compensation committee s consultant using the same methodology used for annual adjustments or were otherwise appropriate. Four of the NEOs received salary increases in this manner.   
         354

           How 2010 annual incentives were determined             For 2010, the annual incentive payments to Mr. Rowe and each of nine other senior executives were funded by a notional incentive pool established by the Exelon compensation committee under the Annual Incentive
Plan for Senior Executives, a shareholder-approved plan, which is intended to comply with Section 162(m). The incentive pool was funded with 1.5% of Exelon s 2010 operating income, the same percentage used in 2009 and 2008, but was not
fully distributed to participants because the committee decided on substantially lesser awards.            Annual incentive payments for 2010 to Messrs. Rowe, O Brien, Crane, McLean, Clark, Pardee, Von Hoene, and Hilzinger were made from the portion of the incentive pool available to fund awards for each of them
based on the company s operating earnings per share, adjusted for non-operating charges and other unusual or non-recurring items.         
  For 2010, the annual incentive payout scale was recalibrated so that the payout at threshold would be 25% of target rather than 50% of target, the
payout at plan would be 50% of target rather than 100% of target, and the payout at distinguished would remain capped at 200%. For executives with general corporate responsibilities, the goal was adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share so
that they would focus their efforts on overall corporate performance. The earnings per share goal ranges were set to be like the forecast earnings ranges. In accordance with the design of the annual
  
         355   

Table of Contents  

incentive program, the compensation committee reviewed 2010 earnings and decided not to include the effects of significant one-time charges or credits that are not normally associated with
ongoing operations and mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities in adjusting earnings for purposes of making awards under the annual incentive plan. The adjusted earnings are consistent with the adjusted (non-GAAP) operating
earnings that Exelon reports in its quarterly earnings releases. For 2010, the adjustments included:         

the cost of Illinois rate relief associated with the legislative settlement and a settlement with the City of Chicago,      

mark-to-market impacts of economic hedging activities,      

unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments,            

costs associated with the John Deere Renewables acquisition,      

charges associated with the impairment of certain emissions allowances,      

expenses associated with the closing of certain fossil generating assets,      

remeasurement of income tax uncertainties relating to ComEd s 1999 sale of fossil generating assets and CTCs received by ComEd and PECO from 1999-2001,

deferred income tax charges associated with the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, and      

the effect of updated studies of asset retirement obligations, including nuclear decommissioning.      
        Actual adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings as reported in
Exelon s earnings release on January 26, 2011 were $4.06. However, the compensation committee decided, for purposes of calculating earnings for the AIP, that the increase in income tax expense pursuant to lower manufacturer s tax
deductions as a result of the decision to contribute $2.1 billion to Exelon s pension funds should not be taken into account. The committee wished to provide an incentive to management to make financial decisions that will benefit the company
in the long run, even if they reduce earnings in the short run. This decision raised earnings for AIP purposes to $4.11 per share, or 152.5% of target.   
         356   

Table of Contents  

   2010 annual incentive payments for other NEOs with specific business unit responsibilities were based
upon a combination of adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share (so that they would focus on overall corporate performance) and business unit financial and/or operating measures, depending on the nature of their responsibilities (so they
would focus on the performance of their business unit). Under the terms of the plan, the business unit financial measures are adjusted from GAAP measures. For ComEd executive officers, adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings of Exelon were not a
goal, consistent with the continuing efforts to recognize ComEd s independence as described above. ComEd s goals included other financial and operational goals. The following table summarizes the goals and weights applicable to the NEOs
for 2010:             Exelon, Generation and PECO

  Mr. Bradford served as Senior Vice President Regulatory   Energy Policy   General Counsel, ComEd until July 4, 2010. He was appointed Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, Exelon effective July 5, 2010 and his applicable annual incentive goals for 2010 were Adjusted Operating Earnings Per Share and Adjusted BSC Total Cost with goal weights of 75% and 25%, respectively.

    ComEd          
          The 2010 annual incentive program included the following shareholder protection features (SPF):         

If threshold earnings per share are not achieved, then no payments will occur; and            

Operating company/business unit key performance indicator payments cannot exceed the earnings per share performance by more than ten percentage points.
              As a result of 2010 earnings for AIP
purposes being at 152.5% of target, the operating company/business unit key performance indicators could not exceed 162.5% of target. The effect of these SPF reductions is shown in the table below.   
        The ComEd annual incentive program includes a limit of payments above
plan based on ComEd s operating net income (the  NI Limiter ). To the extent that the goals yield a payment percentage greater than 50%, those amounts will be limited by ComEd s net income ranging from a 50% payout at operating
net income of $429 million to a 200% payout at operating net income of $496 million.            ComEd s performance under the annual incentive program would have resulted in a preliminary payout at 110.3% of target, which would have been reduced to 102.9% of target by the NI Limiter. In light of overall
company performance and the desire for rough parity in the payout levels of the operating companies, management recommended that the NI Limiter be modified to provide for ten percentage point allowance above the cap, similar to the Exelon SPF
reduction methodology. This modification would permit a payout at 110.3%. In addition, ComEd management originally proposed a 25% payout for the ComEd 2011 long term incentive program. Given that the Exelon performance share program was paying out
at zero, as described below, ComEd management asked that the amount that its management would have been distributed under a 25% ComEd long term incentive program payout be instead paid out to all ComEd employees who participated in the ComEd annual
incentive program, rather than providing the benefit to ComEd leadership only. The compensation committee agreed with these recommendations, and this adjustment increased the payout percentage under the ComEd annual incentive program to 112.1% of
target.            In making annual incentive awards, the compensation
committee has the discretion to reduce or not pay awards even if the targets are met.   
         359   

Table of Contents  

   With respect to the NEOs in the table below, individual performance multipliers (IPM) other than 100%
were approved and recommended by the compensation committee based upon assessments of NEO performance and input from the CEO. Under the terms of the Annual Incentive Program, the individual performance multiplier is used to adjust awards from minus
50% to plus 10% subject to the maximum 200% of target opportunity and the amounts available under the incentive pool. Increases in IPM shown below reflect exceptional performance.   
        Based on the performance against the goals shown in the tables above,
and taking into account the reductions resulting from the shareholder protection feature and the caps and adjustments discussed above, the compensation committee recommended and the Exelon or the ComEd board of directors, as the case may be (or in
the case of Mr. Rowe, the independent directors) approved the following awards for the NEOs:         
       
           How long-term incentives were determined             The compensation committee reviewed the amount of long-term compensation paid in the peer group for positions comparable to the positions held by the NEOs and reduced the targeted amount of long-term incentive
compensation by 33% (except for Mr. Crane, whose targeted amount was reduced by 26%), as part of its initiative to reduce compensation expenses. The committee then applied a ratio of stock options to performance shares in order to determine the
target long-term equity incentives for each NEO, using Black-Scholes valuation for stock options and a 90 day weighted-average price for the preceding quarter to value performance shares. Stock option grants for 2010 were all at the targeted
amounts. The actual amounts of performance shares awarded to the NEOs depended on the extent to which the performance measures were achieved.   
         360   

Table of Contents  

    Stock option awards          
  The company granted non-qualified stock options to the Exelon Corporation senior officers, including the NEOs, but excluding the ComEd NEOs, on
January 25, 2010. The stock option grants for 2010 were all at the targeted amounts. These options were awarded at an exercise price of $46.09, which was the closing price on the January 25, 2010 grant date. The number of the option awards
granted in 2010 was larger than in 2009, reflecting the decrease in the price of Exelon s stock on the grant date in 2010 as compared to the price on the grant date in 2009.   
         Exelon performance share unit awards    
        The 2010 Long-Term Performance Share Unit Award Program was based on
two measures, Exelon s three-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR), compounded monthly, as compared to the TSR for the companies listed in the Dow Jones Utility Index (60% of the award), and Exelon s three-year TSR, as compared to the
companies in the Standard and Poor s 500 Index (40% of the award). This structure was consistent with the structure used in the 2009 program.         
  Payouts are determined based on the following scale: the threshold TSR Position Ranking, for a 50% of target payout, was the
25   th    percentile; the target, for a 100% payout, was 50   th    percentile; and distinguished, for a 200% payout, was the 75   th    percentile, with payouts interpolated for performance falling between the threshold,
target, and distinguished levels.            Exelon fell below
threshold performance levels with respect to both TSR measures. For the performance period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010, Exelon s relative ranking of TSR as compared to the Dow Jones Utility Index was at the 8.3
percentile ranking or 0% of target payout. For the same time period, the company s relative ranking of TSR in the S P 500 Index was at the 13.7 percentile ranking or 0% of target payout. Overall performance against both measures combined
resulted in a zero payout to participants for 2010.            The
amount of each NEO s target opportunity was based on the portion of the long-term incentive value for each NEO attributable to performance share units (75%) and the weighted average Exelon stock price for the fourth quarter of 2009.
           Based on the formula, 2010 Performance Share Unit Awards
for NEOs were as set forth in the following table. The first third of the awarded performance shares vests upon the award date, with the remaining thirds vesting on the date of the compensation committee s January meeting in the next two years.

              Retention awards    
        In conjunction with their promotions and salary increases that were
approved at the June 29, 2010 meeting of the committee, three NEOs received additional equity awards or retention agreements intended to encourage them to remain employed by Exelon or its subsidiaries. These grants were made, in part, because
of the expectation that annual and long term incentive compensation payouts in 2010 would be low and a fear that these individuals might be recruited by other companies. Effective June 1, 2010, the committee granted Mr. Pardee 8,000 shares
of Exelon common stock that will vest on the third anniversary of such date and Mr. Pacilio 12,000 shares of Exelon common stock that will vest on the fifth anniversary of such date. The committee recommended, and the ComEd board approved, a
retention agreement with Mr. O Neill effective July 5, 2010 that will pay him $250,000 if he remains employed by ComEd or an affiliate on the fifth anniversary of that date.             Severance payments          
  Ms. Andrea Zopp resigned from her position as Exelon s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, effective as of May 31, 2010.
Ms. Zopp remained as an employee of Exelon through September 30, 2010 to cooperate in the orderly transition of her duties and to perform such other services as may be reasonably requested from time to time. She remained eligible for
salary and annual incentive compensation through September 30, 2010. Ms. Zopp entered into a separation agreement, the terms of which are consistent with the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan and the Exelon Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan, in which she agreed to restrictive covenants relating to non-solicitation, non-competition, confidential information, intellectual property, and non-disparagement. In addition to the amounts that she will receive that are
consistent with the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan and the Exelon Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, the committee and the Exelon board of directors approved a payment of $200,000 to compensate her for the loss of restricted
stock granted her when she was first employed by Exelon, consistent with the treatment of other executives affected by an involuntary separation. All amounts that Ms. Zopp will receive under her separation agreement are reflected in the Summary
Compensation Table and the related compensation disclosure tables.            Mr. Ian McLean resigned from his position as Exelon s Executive Vice President and President, Exelon Transmission Company, effective as of July 15, 2010. Mr. McLean remained as an employee of
Exelon through August 31, 2010 to cooperate in the orderly transition of his duties and to perform such other services as may be reasonably requested from time to time. He remained eligible for salary and annual incentive compensation through
August 31, 2010. Mr. McLean entered into a retirement and

separation agreement, the terms of which are consistent with the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan and the Exelon Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, in which he agreed to
restrictive covenants relating to non-solicitation, non-competition, confidential information, intellectual property, and non-disparagement. All amounts that Mr. McLean will receive under his retirement and separation agreement are reflected in
the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation disclosure tables.             Tax Consequences          
  Under Section 162(m) of the Code, executive compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a CEO or other person among the four other
highest compensated officers is generally not deductible for purposes of corporate Federal income taxes. However, qualified performance-based compensation, within the meaning of Section 162(m) and applicable regulations, remains deductible. The
compensation committee intends to continue reliance on performance-based compensation programs, consistent with sound executive compensation policy. The compensation committee s policy has been to seek to cause executive incentive compensation
to qualify as  performance-based  in order to preserve its deductibility for Federal income tax purposes to the extent possible, without sacrificing flexibility in designing appropriate compensation programs.   
        Because it is not  qualified performance-based compensation 
within the meaning of Section 162(m), base salary is not eligible for a Federal income tax deduction to the extent that it exceeds $1 million. Accordingly, Exelon is unable to deduct that portion of Mr. Rowe s base salary in excess of
$1 million. Annual incentive awards and performance share units payable to NEOs are intended to be qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), and are therefore deductible for Federal income tax purposes. However, because of
the element of compensation committee and ComEd board of directors discretion in the 2010-2012 ComEd Long-Term Incentive Program, payments under that program are not eligible for Federal income tax deduction to the extent that, combined with an
individual s base salary, payments exceed $1 million. Restricted stock and restricted stock units are not deductible by the company for Federal income tax purposes under the provisions of Section 162(m) if NEOs  compensation that is
not  qualified performance-based compensation  is in excess of $1 million.            Under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, there is a excise tax if change in control or severance benefits are greater than 2.99 times the five-year average amount of income reported on an
individual s W-2. In April 2009 the compensation committee adopted a policy that no future employment or severance agreements that provide for benefits for NEOs on account of termination will include an excise tax gross-up. However, certain
NEOs have change in control severance agreements that pre-date April 2009 that provide excise tax gross-ups, and avoid gross-ups by reducing payments to under the threshold if the amount otherwise payable to an executive is not more than 110% of the
threshold.             Conclusion    
        The compensation committee is confident that Exelon s
compensation programs are performance-based and consistent with sound executive compensation policy. They are designed to attract, retain and reward outstanding executives and to motivate and reward senior management for achieving high levels of
business performance, customer satisfaction and outstanding financial results that build shareholder value.

    Summary Compensation Table    
        The tables below summarize the total compensation paid or earned by
each of the NEOs of Exelon, Generation, PECO (shown in one table because of the overlap in their named executive officers) and ComEd for the year ended December 31, 2010.   
        Salary amounts may not match the amounts discussed in Compensation
Discussion and Analysis because that discussion concerns salary rates; the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Tables reflect actual amounts paid during the year including the effect of changes in salary rates. Changes to base salary
generally take effect on March 1, and there may also be changes at other times during the year to reflect promotions or changes in responsibilities.         
  Bonus reflects discretionary bonuses or amounts paid under the annual incentive plan on the basis of the individual performance multiplier or
discretionary amounts approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors or, in the case of Mr. Rowe, approved by the independent directors.         
  Stock awards and option awards show the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.   
        Stock awards consist primarily of performance share awards pursuant to
the terms of the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The compensation committee established a performance share unit award program based on total shareholder return for Exelon as compared to the companies in the Standard   Poor s 500 Index
and the Dow Jones Utility Index for a three-year period. The threshold, target and distinguished goals for performance unit share awards are established on the grant date (generally the date of the first compensation committee meeting in the fiscal
year). The actual performance against the goals and the number of performance unit share awards are established on the award date (generally the date of the first compensation committee meeting after the completion of the fiscal year). Upon
retirement or involuntary termination without cause, earned but non-vested shares are eligible for accelerated vesting. The form of payment provides for payment in Exelon common stock to executives with lower levels of stock ownership, with
increasing portions of the payments being made in cash as executives  stock ownership levels increase in excess of the ownership guidelines. If an executive achieves 125% or more of the applicable ownership target, performance shares will be
paid half in cash and half in stock. If executive vice presidents and above achieve 200% or more of their applicable stock ownership target, their performance shares will be paid entirely in cash. In limited cases, the compensation committee has
determined that it is necessary to grant restricted shares of Exelon common stock or restricted stock units to executives as a means to recruit and retain talent. They may be used for new hires to offset annual or long-term incentives that are
forfeited from a previous employer. They are also used as a retention vehicle and are subject to forfeiture if the executive voluntarily terminates, and in some cases may incorporate performance criteria as well as time-based vesting. When awarded,
restricted stock or stock units are earned by continuing employment for a pre-determined period of time or, in some instances, after certain performance requirements are met. In some cases, the award may vest ratably over a period; in other cases,
it vests in full at one or more pre-determined dates. Amounts of restricted shares held by each NEO, if any, are shown in the footnotes to the Outstanding Equity Table.   
        All option awards are made pursuant to the terms of the 2006 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. All options are granted at a strike price that is not less than the fair market value of a share of stock on the date of grant. Fair market value is defined under the plans as the closing price on the grant date as reported on the
New York Stock Exchange. Individuals receiving stock options are provided the right to buy a fixed number of shares of Exelon common stock at the closing price of such stock on the grant date. The target for the number of options awarded is
determined by the portion of the long-term incentive value attributable to stock options and a theoretical value of each option determined by the   
         366

compensation committee using a lattice binomial ratio valuation formula. Options vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period and have a term of ten years. Employees who are
retirement eligible are eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement or termination without cause. Time vesting adds a retention element to the stock option program. All grants to the NEOs must be approved by the full board of directors, which
acts after receiving a recommendation from the compensation committee, except grants to Mr. Rowe, which must be approved by the independent directors, who act after receiving recommendation from the compensation committee.   
        Non-equity incentive plan compensation includes the amounts earned
under the annual incentive plan by the extent to which the applicable financial and operational goals were achieved and, for ComEd NEOs, amounts paid under the ComEd Long Term Incentive Program. The amount of the annual incentive target opportunity
is expressed as a percentage of the officer s or employee s base salary, and actual awards are determined using the base salary at the end of the year. Threshold, target and distinguished (i.e. maximum) achievement levels are established
for each goal. Threshold is set at the minimally acceptable level of performance, for a payout of 50% of target. Target is set consistent with the achievement of the business plan objectives. Distinguished is set at a level that significantly
exceeds the business plan and has a low probability of payout, and is capped at 200% of target. Awards are interpolated to the extent performance falls between the threshold, target, and distinguished levels. For 2010, the payout scales were
recalibrated, with threshold paying out at 25%, plan paying out at 50%, target paying out at 100%, and distinguished paying out at 200%.

  Mr. Rowe is entitled to up to 60 hours of personal use of corporate aircraft each year. Mr. Crane was also permitted to use the corporate aircraft on two occasions in
2010 to minimize the time he spent away from Exelon responsibilities while attending meetings of another board of directors on which he serves. The figures shown in this column include $206,852 and $31,684 representing the aggregate incremental cost
to Exelon for personal use of corporate aircraft by Mr. Rowe and Mr. Crane respectively. These costs were calculated using the hourly cost for flight services paid to the aircraft vendor, Federal excise tax, fuel charges, and domestic
segment fees. From time to time Mr. Rowe s spouse accompanies Mr. Rowe in his travel on corporate aircraft. The aggregate incremental cost to the company, if any, for Mrs. Rowe s travel on corporate aircraft is included in
this amount. For all executive officers, including Mr. Rowe, Exelon pays the cost of spousal travel, meals, and other related amenities when they attend company or industry-related events where it is customary and expected that officers attend
with their spouses. The aggregate incremental cost to Exelon for these expenses is included in the table. In most cases, there is no incremental cost to Exelon of providing transportation or other amenities for a spouse, and the only additional cost
to Exelon is to reimburse officers for the taxes on the imputed income attributable to their spousal travel, meals, and related amenities when attending company or industry-related events. This cost is shown in column (b) of the All Other
Compensation Table above.

  The company maintains several cars and drivers in order to provide transportation services for the NEOs and other officers to carry out their duties among the company s
various offices and facilities which are located throughout northeastern Illinois and southeastern Pennsylvania. Messrs. Rowe, Clark, and O Brien are also entitled to limited personal use of the company s cars and drivers, including use
for commuting which allows them to work while commuting. The cost included in the table represents the estimated incremental cost to Exelon to provide limited personal service. This cost is based upon the number of hours that the drivers worked
overtime providing services to each NEO, multiplied by the average overtime rate for drivers plus an additional amount for fuel and maintenance. Personal use was imputed as additional taxable income to Messrs. Rowe, Clark, and O Brien.

(3)  
  For NEOs whose primary work location is downtown Chicago, Exelon s office lease provides for a limited number of parking spaces that are available for Exelon use. When NEOs
are unable to utilize the available spaces, Exelon provides reimbursement for parking expenses incurred at other public garages.     

(4)  
  Executive officers may use company-provided vendors for comprehensive physical examinations and related follow-up testing. Executives also receive certain gifts during the year
in recognition of their services that are imputed to the officer as additional taxable income. Certain NEOs were also provided with company paid travel insurance during 2010, the cost of this insurance was imputed to the NEO as additional taxable
income.

target (for the ComEd NEOs, the rows labeled  CE LTI  are for the long-term incentive, and the rows labeled  AIP  are for the annual incentive). Under the terms of both incentive plans, threshold performance earns 25% of the
respective target, while performance at plan earns 50% of the respective target and the maximum payout is capped at 200% of target. For additional information about the terms of these programs, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis above.

  Mr. O Brien and Mr. McLean (prior to his separation from Exelon) each exercised options pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that were entered into when each was
unaware of any material information regarding Exelon that had not been publicly disclosed. The formula for the exercise and sale dates, number of options, and sale price was set at the time the trading plans were established.

  For Mr. Acevedo, the shares received upon vesting includes 748 shares from the Key Manager Restricted Stock Unit Program that vested on January 25, 2010 that were
valued at $46.09.     

Pension Benefits             Exelon sponsors the Exelon Corporation Retirement Program, a traditional defined benefit pension plan that covers certain
management employees who commenced employment prior to January 1, 2001 and certain collective bargaining unit employees. The Exelon Corporation Retirement Program includes the Service Annuity System (SAS), the legacy ComEd pension plan, and the
Service Annuity Plan (SAP), the legacy PECO pension plan. Effective January 1, 2001, Exelon also established two cash balance defined benefit pension plans in order to both reduce future retirement benefit costs and provide an option that is
portable as the company anticipated a work force that was more mobile than the traditional utility workforce. The cash balance defined benefit pension plans cover management employees and certain collective bargaining unit employees hired on or
after such date, as well as certain management employees hired prior to such date who elected to transfer to a cash balance plan. Each of these plans is intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. An employee
can participate in only one of the qualified pension plans.         
  For NEOs participating in the SAS, the annuity benefit payable at normal retirement age is equal to the sum of 1.25% of the participant s
earnings as of December 25, 1994, reduced by a portion of the participant s Social Security benefit as of that date, plus 1.6% of the participant s highest average annual pay, multiplied by the participant s years of credited
service (up to a maximum of 40 years). For NEOs participating in the SAP, the annuity benefit payable at normal retirement age is equal to the greater of the amount determined under the Career Pay Formula, which is 2% of each year s
  
         379   

Table of Contents  

pensionable pay, and the amount determined under the Final Average Pay Formula, which is the sum of (a) 5% of average earnings, plus 1.2% of average earnings for each year of pension service
(up to a maximum of 40 years), and (b) 0.35% of average earnings in excess of covered compensation for each year of pension service (up to a maximum of 40 years). Pension-eligible compensation for the SAS and the SAP s Final Average Pay
Formula includes base pay and annual incentive awards. Pension eligible compensation in the SAP s Career Pay Formula includes base pay, incentive awards and other regular remuneration. Benefits under the SAS and SAP are vested after five years
of service.            The  normal retirement age  under
both the SAS and the SAP is 65. Each of these plans also offers an early retirement benefit prior to age 65, which is payable if a participant retires after attainment of age 50 and completion of ten years of service. The annual pension payable
under each plan is determined as of the early retirement date, reduced by 2% for each year of payment before age 60 to age 58, then 3% for each year before age 58 to age 50. In addition, under the SAS, the early retirement benefit is supplemented by
a temporary payment equal to 80% of the participant s estimated monthly Social Security benefit. The supplemental benefit is partially offset by a reduction in the regular annuity benefit.   
        Under the cash balance pension plan, a notional account is established
for each participant, and the account balance grows as a result of annual benefit credits and annual investment credits. (Employees who participated in the SAS or the SAP prior to January 1, 2001 and elected to transfer to the cash balance plan
also have a frozen transferred benefit from the former plan, and received a  transition  credit based on their age, service and compensation at the time of transfer.) Beginning January 1, 2008, the annual benefit credit under the plan
is 7.00% of base pay and annual incentive award (subject to applicable Internal Revenue Code limit). For the portion of the account balance accrued beginning January 1, 2008, the annual investment credit is the third segment rate of interest on
long-term investment grade corporate bonds, as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Section 430(h)(2)(C)(iii). The Segment Rate will be determined as of November of the year for which the cash balance account receives the investment credit.
For the portion of the benefit accrued before January 1, 2008, pending Internal Revenue Service guidance, the annual investment credit is the greater of 4%, or the average for the year of the S P 500 Index and the applicable interest rate
specified in Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code that is used to determine lump sum payments (the interest rate is determined in November of each year). Benefits are vested after three years of service, and are payable in an annuity or
a lump sum at any time following termination of employment. Apart from the benefit credits and vesting requirement, and as described above, years of service are not relevant to a determination of accrued benefits under the cash balance pension
plans.            The Internal Revenue Code limits to $245,000 the
individual annual compensation that may be taken into account under the tax-qualified retirement plan. As permitted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Exelon sponsors two supplemental executive retirement plans (or  SERPs ) that
allow the payment to a select group of management or highly-compensated individuals out of its general assets of any benefits calculated under provisions of the applicable qualified pension plan which may be above these limits. The SERPs offers a
lump sum as an optional form of payment, which includes the value of the marital annuity, death benefits and other early retirement subsidies at a designated interest rate. The interest rate applicable for distributions to participants in the SAS in
2010 is 4.49% and for participants in the SAP in 2010 is 2.5%. For participants in the cash balance pension plan, the lump sum is the value of the non-qualified account balance. The value of the lump sum amounts do not include the value of any
pension benefits covered under the qualified pension plans, and the methods and assumptions used to determine the non-qualified lump sum amount are different than the assumptions used to generate the present values shown in the tables of benefits to
be received upon retirement, termination due to death or disability, involuntary separation not related to a change in control, or upon a qualifying termination following a change in control which appear later in this document.

   Under the terms of the SERPs, participants are provided the amount of benefits they would have
received under the SAS, SAP or cash balance plan, as applicable, but for the application of the Internal Revenue Code limits. In addition, certain executives previously received grants of additional credited service under a SERP. In particular,
Mr. Crane received an additional ten years of credited service through December 31, 2010 as part of his employment offer that provides one additional year of service credit for each year of employment to a maximum of 10 additional years.
Pursuant to his employment agreement first entered into when he joined the Company in 1998, Mr. Rowe is entitled to receive a SERP benefit that, when added to SAS benefit, will be determined as though he had earned 20 years of service on
March 16, 1998 and one additional year of service on each anniversary of that date occurring prior to his termination of employment. A portion of Mr. Rowe s benefit may be forfeited upon a termination for  cause  (see below
under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control Employment Agreement with Mr. Rowe).         
  As of January 1, 2004, Exelon does not grant additional years of credited service to executives under the SERP for any period in which services
are not actually performed, except that up to two years of service credits may be provided under severance or change in control agreements first entered into after such date. Service credits previously available under employment, change in control
or severance agreements or arrangements (or any successors arrangements) are not affected by this policy.         
  The amount of the change in the pension value for each of the named executive officers is the amount included in the Summary Compensation Table
above in the column headed  Change in Pension Value   Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings.  The present value of each NEO s accumulated pension benefit is shown in the following tables. The assumptions used in
estimating the present values include the following: for Service Annuity System participants, pension benefits are assumed to begin at each participant s earliest unreduced retirement age; and for cash balance plan participants, pension
benefits are assumed to begin at the earliest unreduced age. The applicable discount rates are 5.83% as of December 31, 2009 and 5.26% as of December 31, 2010. The lump sum rate amounts are determined using the rate of 5% for SAS
participants and 4.0% for SAP participants, both at the assumed retirement age, and the account balance for cash balance pension plan participants. The applicable mortality table as of December 31, 2009 is the IRS-required mortality table for
2010 funding valuation. The applicable table as of December 31, 2010 is the IRS required mortality table for 2011 funding valuation.

    Deferred Compensation Programs    
        Exelon offers deferred compensation plans to permit the deferral of
certain cash compensation to facilitate tax and retirement planning and satisfaction of stock ownership requirements for executives and key managers. Exelon maintains non-qualified deferred compensation plans that are open to certain
highly-compensated employees, including the NEOs.            The
Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified plan that permits executives and key managers to defer receipt of base compensation and the company to credit related matching contributions that would have been contributed to the Exelon Corporation
Employee Savings Plan (the company s tax-qualified 401(k) plan) but for the applicable limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Deferred Compensation Plan permits participants to defer taxation of a portion of their income. It benefits the
company by deferring the payment of a portion of its compensation expense, thus preserving cash.            The Employee Savings Plan is tax-qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). Exelon maintains the Employee Savings Plan to attract and retain qualified employees,
including the NEOs, and to encourage employees to save some percentage of their cash compensation for their eventual retirement. The Employee Savings Plan permits employees to do so, and allows the company to make matching contributions in a
relatively tax-efficient manner. The company maintains the excess matching feature of the Deferred Compensation Plan to enable management employees to save for their eventual retirement to the extent they otherwise would have were it not for the
limits established by the IRS for purposes of Federal tax policy.            The Stock Deferral Plan is a non-qualified plan that permitted executives to defer performance share units prior to 2007.         
  In response to declining plan enrollment and the administrative complexity of compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the compensation
committee approved amendments to the Deferred Compensation and Stock Deferral Plans at its December 4, 2006 meeting. The amendments cease future compensation deferrals for the Stock Deferral Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan other than the
excess Employee Savings Plan contribution deferrals.            The
following tables show the amounts that NEOs have accumulated under both the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Stock Deferral Plan. Both plans were closed to new deferrals of base pay (other than excess Employee Savings Plan deferrals), annual
incentive payments or performance shares awards in 2007, and participants were granted a one-time election to receive a distribution of their accumulated balance in each plan during 2007. Existing balances will continue to accrue dividends or other
earnings until payout upon termination. Balances in the Deferred Compensation Plan will be settled in cash upon the termination event selected by the officer and will be distributed either in a lump sum, or in annual installments. Share balances in
the Stock Deferral Plan continue to earn the same dividends that are available to all shareholders, which are reinvested as additional shares in the plan. Balances in the plan are distributed in shares of Exelon stock in a lump sum or installments
upon termination of employment.            The Deferred Compensation
Plan continues in effect, without change, for those officers who participate in the 401(k) savings plan and who reach their statutory contribution limit during the year. After this limit is reached, their elected payroll contributions and company
matching contribution will be credited to their account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment options under the Deferred Compensation Plan consist of a basket of mutual funds benchmarks that mirror those funds available to all employees
through the 401(k) plan, with the exception of one benchmark fund that offers a fixed percentage return over a specified market return. Deferred amounts represent unfunded unsecured obligations of the company.

In 2007, all participants in the deferred compensation plan were eligible to receive a distribution of their entire account balance in the plan accumulated through
December 31, 2006. Messrs. Rowe, Hilzinger, Barnett, Crane, Pardee, Clark, Trpik and Donnelly elected to receive this distribution. Since receiving a distribution of their entire accumulated balance in 2007, all executive contributions which
are included in the aggregate balance at fiscal year end have been included in base salary in the Summary Compensation Table for each year, and all registrant contributions that are included in the aggregate balance at fiscal year end have been
included in all other compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for each year for each of these NEOs.     

For Messrs. O Brien and McLean, who did not elect to receive the distribution of their accumulated plan balance in 2007, the following amounts consisting of both executive
contributions and registrant contributions have been included in the Summary Compensation Table either as either base salary or all other compensation for prior years where these individuals have been included as NEOs: $875,884 and $275,281

    Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control    
         Employment Agreement with Mr. Rowe    
        Under the third amended and restated employment agreement between
Exelon and Mr. Rowe, Mr. Rowe will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, Chairman of Exelon s board of directors and a member of the board of directors until December 31, 2012.   
        If, prior to July 1, 2011, Exelon terminates Mr. Rowe s
employment for reasons other than cause, death or disability or Mr. Rowe terminates his employment for good reason, he would be eligible for the following benefits:   

a lump sum payment of Mr. Rowe s accrued but unpaid base salary and annual incentive, if any, and a prorated annual incentive for the year in which his
employment terminates based on the lesser of (1) the annual incentive that would have been paid based on actual performance without application of negative discretion to reduce the amount of the award, and (2) the formula annual incentive
(i.e., the greater of the annual incentive for the last year ending prior to termination or the average of the annual incentives payable with respect to Mr. Rowe s last three full years of employment);      

a lump sum severance payment equal to his base salary and the formula annual incentive, multiplied by the number of years (including fractional years) remaining
until the later of July 1, 2011 or the first anniversary of the termination date;            

continuation of life, disability, accident, health and other active welfare benefits for him and his family for a period equal to the number of years (including
fractional years) remaining until the later of July 1, 2011 or the first anniversary of the termination date, followed by post-retirement healthcare coverage for him and his wife for the remainder of their respective lives;

all exercisable stock options remain exercisable until the applicable option expiration date;      

non-vested stock options become exercisable and thereafter remain exercisable until the applicable option expiration date;      

previously earned but non-vested performance share units vest, consistent with the terms of the performance share unit award program under the LTIP, and an award
based on actual performance for the year in which the termination occurs; and            

any non-vested restricted stock award vests.            
  If such a termination occurs within 24 months after a Change in Control of Exelon or within 18 months after a Significant Acquisition, as such
terms are described under  Change in Control Employment Agreements and Severance Plan Covering Other Named Executives,  or Mr. Rowe resigns before July 1, 2011 because of the failure to be appointed or elected as Exelon s
Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of Exelon s board of directors, and a member of the board of directors, then Mr. Rowe would receive the termination benefits described above except that:   

the annual incentive award described above and payable for the year in which Mr. Rowe s employment terminates will be paid in full, rather than
prorated;            

in determining the amount of such full formula annual incentive and the lump sum severance payment described above, the formula annual incentive will be the
greater of the amount described in the preceding paragraph or the target annual incentive for the year in which his employment terminates, but not greater than the annual incentive for the year in which the termination occurs based on actual
performance without the application of negative discretion to reduce the amount of the award;      
         385   

Table of Contents  

the SERP benefit will be determined taking into account the lump sum severance payment, as though it were paid in installments and Mr. Rowe remained
employed during the severance period; and            

professional outplacement services will be provided for up to twelve months.               The term  good reason  means any material breach of the employment agreement by Exelon, including:   

a failure to provide compensation and benefits required under the employment agreement (including a reduction in base salary that is not commensurate with and
applied to Exelon s other senior executives) without Mr. Rowe s consent;            

causing Mr. Rowe to report to someone other than Exelon s board of directors;      

any material adverse change in Mr. Rowe s status, responsibilities or perquisites; or      

any public announcement by Exelon s board of directors without Mr. Rowe s consent that Exelon is seeking his replacement, other than with respect
to the period following July 1, 2011.            
  With respect to a termination of employment during the Change in Control or Significant Acquisition periods described above, the following events
will constitute additional grounds for termination for good reason:         

a good faith determination by Mr. Rowe that he is substantially unable to perform, or that there has been a material reduction in, any of his duties,
functions, responsibilities or authority;            

the failure of any successor to assume his employment agreement;      

a relocation of Exelon s principal offices by more than 50 miles; or      

a 20% increase in the amount of time that Mr. Rowe must spend traveling for business outside of the Chicago area.      
        In the event Mr. Rowe s employment terminates for cause, all
outstanding stock options (whether vested or non-vested), non-vested performance shares and restricted stock will be forfeited. Upon a termination for cause on or before March 16, 2010 (the retirement date specified under a prior version of his
employment agreement), the portion of the SERP benefit that accrued after March 16, 2006 (the retirement date specified under his original employment agreement) also would be forfeited.            The term  cause  means any of the following, unless cured within the time period specified in the agreement:

conviction of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, fraud or dishonesty;      

willful misconduct in the performance of duties intended to personally benefit the executive; or      

material breach of the agreement (other than as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness).      
        Upon Mr. Rowe s retirement or his termination of employment
due to disability or death:         

Mr. Rowe (or his beneficiary or estate) will receive a prorated annual incentive for the year in which the termination occurs, determined under the method
described above for a  good reason  termination;            

all exercisable stock options remain exercisable until the applicable option expiration date;      

non-vested stock options become exercisable and thereafter remain exercisable until the applicable option expiration;      
         386   

Table of Contents  

previously earned but non-vested performance share units vest, consistent with the terms of the performance share award program under the LTIP, and he (or his
beneficiary or estate) will receive an award for the year in which the termination occurs;            

any non-vested restricted stock award vests, unless otherwise provided in the grant instrument; and      

he will be entitled to receive post-retirement healthcare coverage for him and his wife for the remainder of their respective lives.
              The term  retirement  means:

Mr. Rowe s termination of employment prior to July 1, 2011 other than a termination by him for good reason or a termination by the Company with or
without cause or upon disability or death;            

Mr. Rowe s termination of employment on or after July 1, 2011 other than a termination by the Company with cause or upon disability or death.
              Upon Mr. Rowe s retirement or
termination of employment for any reason other than cause, disability or death:         

For a period of five years, Mr. Rowe is required to attend board of directors meetings as requested by the board or the then-chairman, attend civic,
charitable and corporate events, serve on civic and charitable boards and represent the Company at industry and trade association events as the Company s representative, and provide the then-chairman or the then-CEO advice or counseling on
energy policy issues or strategy, each as mutually agreed;            

The Company is required to provide Mr. Rowe with five years of office and secretarial services.      
        Mr. Rowe is subject to confidentiality restrictions and to
non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement restrictions continuing in effect for two years following his termination of employment, and is required to sign a general release to receive severance payments. If the payments or benefits
payable to Mr. Rowe would be subject to excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on excess parachute payments or under similar state or local law, such payments and benefits shall be reduced or eliminated to the
extent necessary to avoid such excise taxes unless doing so would leave Mr. Rowe with less after-tax payments and benefits than paying such amounts and the applicable excise taxes. Any payment to Mr. Rowe upon a termination of employment
is subject to a six-month delay to the extent required under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and his agreement will be otherwise interpreted and construed to comply with Section 409A.   
         Change in control employment agreements and severance plan covering other named
executives             Exelon s change in control and
severance benefits policies were initially adopted in January 2001 and harmonized the policies of Exelon s predecessor companies. In adopting the policies, the compensation committee considered the advice of a consultant who advised that the
levels were consistent with competitive practice and reasonable. The Exelon benefits include multiples of change in control benefits ranging from two times base salary and annual bonus for corporate and subsidiary vice presidents to 2.99 times base
salary and annual bonus for the executive committee and select senior vice presidents other than the CEO. In 2003, the compensation committee reviewed the terms of the Senior Management Severance Plan and revised it to reduce the situations when an
executive could terminate and claim severance benefits for  good reason , clarified the definition of  cause , and reduced non-change in control benefits for executives with less than two years of service. In December 2004, the
compensation committee s consultant presented a report on competitive practice on executive severance. The competitive practices described in the report were generally comparable to   
         387   

Table of Contents  

the benefits provided under Exelon s severance policies. In discussing the compensation consultant s December 2007 annual report to the committee on compensation trends, the consultant
commented that Exelon s change in control and severance policies were conservative, citing the use of double triggers, and that they remained competitive. In April 2009 the compensation committee adopted a policy that Exelon would not include
excise tax gross-up payment provisions in senior executive employment, change in control, or severance plans, programs or agreements that are entered into, adopted or materially amended on or after April 2, 2009 (other than renewals of existing
arrangements that are not materially amended or arrangements assumed pursuant to a corporate transaction).         
  Exelon has entered into change in control employment agreements with the named executive officers other than Mr. Rowe, which generally protect
such executives  position and compensation levels for two years after a change in control of Exelon. The agreements are initially effective for a period of two years, and provide for a one-year extension each year thereafter until cancellation
or termination of employment.            During
the 24-month period following a change in control, or during the 18-month period following another significant corporate transaction affecting the executive s business unit in which Exelon shareholders retain between 60% and 66   2   /   3   % control (a significant acquisition), if a named executive officer resigns for good reason or if the executive s employment is
terminated by Exelon other than for cause or disability, the executive is entitled to the following:         

the executive s annual incentive and performance share unit awards for the year in which termination occurs;      

severance payments equal to 2.99 times the sum of (1) the executive s base salary plus (2) the higher of the executive s target annual
incentive for the year of termination or the executive s average annual incentive award payments for the two years preceding the termination, but not more than the annual incentive for the year of termination based on actual performance before
the application of negative discretion;            

a benefit equal to the amount payable under the SERP determined as if (1) the SERP benefit were fully vested, (2) the executive had 2.99 additional
years of age and years of service (2.0 years for executives who first entered into such agreements after 2003) and (3) the severance pay constituted covered compensation for purposes of the SERP;      

a benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent present value of any non-vested accrued benefit under Exelon s qualified defined benefit retirement plan;

all previously-awarded stock options, performance shares or units, restricted stock, or restricted share units become fully vested, and the stock options remain
exercisable until (1) the option expiration date, for options granted before January 1, 2002 or (2) the earlier of the fifth anniversary of his termination date or the option s expiration date, for options granted after that
date;            

life, disability, accident, health and other welfare benefit coverage continues for three years on the same terms and conditions applicable to active employees,
followed by retiree health coverage if the executive has attained at least age 50 and completed at least ten years of service (or any lesser eligibility requirement then in effect for regular employees); and      

outplacement services for at least twelve months.            
  The change in control benefits are also provided if the executive is terminated other than for cause or disability, or terminates for good reason
(1) after a tender offer or proxy contest commences, or after Exelon enters into an agreement which, if consummated, would cause a change in control, and within one year after such termination a change in control does occur, or (2) within
two years after a sale or spin-off of the executive s business unit in contemplation of a change in control that actually occurs within 60 days after such sale or spin-off (a disaggregation).   
         388   

Table of Contents  

   A change in control generally occurs:         

when any person acquires 20% of Exelon s voting securities;      

when the incumbent members of the Exelon board of directors (or new members nominated by a majority of incumbent directors) cease to constitute at least a
majority of the members of the Exelon board of directors;            

upon consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation, or sale or other disposition of at least 50% of Exelon s operating assets (excluding a
transaction where Exelon shareholders retain at least 60% of the voting power); or            

upon shareholder approval of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution.               The term good reason under the change in control employment agreements generally includes any of the following occurring
within two years after a change in control or disaggregation or within 18 months after a significant acquisition:         

a material reduction in salary, incentive compensation opportunity or aggregate benefits, unless such reduction is part of a policy, program or arrangement
applicable to peer executives;            

failure of a successor to assume the agreement;            

a material breach of the agreement by Exelon; or            

any of the following, but only after a change in control or disaggregation: (1) a material adverse reduction in the executive s position, duties or
responsibilities (other than a change in the position or level of officer to whom the executive reports or a change that is part of a policy, program or arrangement applicable to peer executives) or (2) a required relocation by more than 50
miles.               The term cause under the change in
control employment agreements generally includes any of the following:   

refusal to perform or habitual neglect in the performance of duties or responsibilities or of specific directives of the officer to whom the executive reports
which are not materially inconsistent with the scope and nature of the executive s duties and responsibilities;            

willful or reckless commission of acts or omissions which have resulted in or are likely to result in a material loss or material damage to the reputation of
Exelon or any of its affiliates, or that compromise the safety of any employee;            

commission of a felony or any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude;            

material violation of the code of business conduct which would constitute grounds for immediate termination of employment, or of any statutory or common-law duty
of loyalty; or            

any breach of the executive s restrictive covenants.      
        Executives other than Mr. Rowe who have entered into such change
in control employment agreements prior to April 2, 2009 (and which have not been materially amended after such date) will be eligible to receive an additional payment to cover excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code on excess parachute payments or under similar state or local law, but only if the after-tax amount of payments and benefits subject to these taxes exceeds 110% of the safe harbor amount that would not subject the employee to these excise taxes.
If the after-tax amount is less than 110% of the safe harbor amount, then payments and benefits subject to these taxes would be reduced or eliminated to equal the safe harbor amount.   
         389   

Table of Contents  

   If a named executive officer other than Mr. Rowe resigns for good reason or is terminated by
Exelon other than for cause or disability, in each case under circumstances not covered by an individual change in control employment agreement, the named executive officer may be eligible for the following non-change in control benefits under the
Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan:         

prorated payment of the executive s annual incentive and performance share unit awards for the year in which termination occurs;

for a two-year severance period, continued payment of an amount representing base salary and target annual incentive;      

a benefit equal to the amount payable under the SERP determined as if the severance payments were paid as ordinary base salary and annual incentive;

for the two-year severance period, continuation of health, basic life and other welfare benefits the executive was receiving immediately prior to the severance
period on the same terms and conditions applicable to active employees, followed by retiree health coverage if the executive has attained at least age fifty and completed at least ten years of service (or any lesser eligibility requirement then in
effect for non-executive employees); and            

outplacement services for at least six months.            
  Payments under the Senior Management Severance Plan are subject to reduction by Exelon to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of excise taxes
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on excess parachute payments or under similar state or local law.         
  The term  good reason  under the Senior Management Severance Plan means either of the following:   

a material reduction of the executive s salary, incentive compensation opportunity or aggregate benefits unless such reduction is part of a policy, program
or arrangement applicable to peer executives of Exelon or of the business unit that employs the executive; or            

a material adverse reduction in the executive s position or duties (other than a change in the position or level of officer to whom the executive reports)
that is not applicable to peer executives of Exelon or of the executive s business unit, but excluding any change (1) resulting from a reorganization or realignment of all or a significant portion of the business, operations or senior
management of Exelon or of the executive s business unit or (2) that generally places the executive in substantially the same level of responsibility.      
        The term cause under the Senior Management Severance Plan has the same
meaning as the definition of such term under the individual change in control employment agreements.         
  Benefits under the change in control employment agreements and the Senior Management Severance Plan are subject to termination upon an
executive s violation of his or her restrictive covenants, and incentive payments under the agreements and the plan may be subject to the recoupment policy adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.   
         Estimated Value of Benefits to be Received Upon Retirement    
        The following tables show the estimated value of payments and other
benefits to be conferred upon the NEOs assuming they retired as of December 31, 2010. These payments and benefits are in addition to the present value of the accumulated benefits from each NEO s qualified and non-qualified pension plans

  Under the terms of the 2010 AIP, a pro-rated actual incentive award is payable upon retirement assuming an Individual Performance Multiplier (IPM) of 100% and based on the number

before the application of negative discretion by the board of directors) or (ii) Formula Annual Incentive, based on days worked during the year of retirement. His Formula Annual Incentive is defined as the greater of the (i) target annual
incentive for the year of termination, (ii) the actual annual incentive paid for the latest calendar year ended on or before the termination, and (iii) the average annual incentive paid for the three years prior to the year of termination.
Incentive calculations assume an IPM of 100% for the termination year.

stock or restricted stock units that may vest upon retirement. For previously unvested stock options, the value is determined by taking the spread between the closing price of Exelon stock on December 31, 2010, which was $41.64 and the exercise
price of each unvested stock option grant, multiplied by the number of unvested options. If an NEO has attained age 50 with 10 or more years of service (or deemed service), his or her unvested stock options will vest upon termination of employment
because he or she has satisfied the definition of retirement under the LTIP. For all performance share units and restricted shares or restricted share units, the value is based on the December 31, 2010 closing price of Exelon stock.

  The cash payment is composed of payment equal to a specified multiple of the NEO s base salary plus a pro-rated annual incentive award assuming an IPM of 100% and based on
the number of days worked in the year of termination. Other than Mr. Rowe, the executives are participants in the Senior Management Severance Plan ( SMSP ) and severance benefits are determined pursuant to Section 4 of the
Severance Plan. Pursuant to Section 7.3(a) of his employment agreement, Mr. Rowe is entitled to a pro-rata portion of the lesser of his (i) actual annual incentive in the year of termination (determined before the application of
negative discretion by the board of directors) or (ii) Formula Annual Incentive, based on days worked during the year of termination. Incentive calculations assume an IPM of 100% for the termination year. For all other officers except Messrs.
Rowe, Hilzinger, Barnett, Bonney, Acevedo, Trpik, O Neill, Donnelly and Bradford, the multiple used for base salary and annual incentive is 2. For Messrs. Barnett, Bonney, Acevedo, Trpik, O Neill and Donnelly the multiple is 1.25 and for

  In 2009, the compensation committee adopted a policy that no future employment or severance agreements will provide for an excise tax gross-up payment. The SMSP as amended and
restated on January 1, 2009 and CIC Employment Agreements that become effective after April 2, 2009 will reduce executives  parachute payments to his or her safe harbor in order to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code. Messrs. O Brien, Crane, Von Hoene Jr, Clark, and Pardee have grandfathered CIC Employment Agreements, which still entitle these NEOs to an excise tax gross-up payment only if the present value of their parachute
payments exceed their safe harbor amount by more than 10%. If their parachute payments do not exceed the amount permitted by the IRS by more than 10%, their payments are reduced to their safe harbor.     

Mr. Rowe s Employment Agreement was amended on October 27, 2009 to eliminate his excise tax gross-up protection and provide him with a  best after-tax 
provision pursuant to which the Company will reduce his parachute payments to his safe harbor amount if his after-tax benefits would be higher following such a reduction of payments. If his after-tax benefits would be greater without a reduction of
his parachute payments to his safe harbor amount, the Company will not reduce his payments and Mr. Rowe will be responsible for paying the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.     

Amounts in this column represent the estimated value of the required excise tax gross-up payment or scaleback, if applicable.

  Mr. D Alessio received an additional annual retainer to serve at the board s lead director. This retainer was prorated from the date of his appointment.

  In addition to the amounts shown in the table, Drs. Palms and Richardson, who also serve as directors of the Exelon Foundation, received $6,000 each from the Foundation for
attending meetings of the Foundation s board. Exelon contributes to the Foundation to pay for the Foundation s operating expenses.           
   Fees Earned or Paid in Cash          
  The Exelon board has a policy of targeting their compensation to the median board compensation of the same peer group of companies used to benchmark
executive compensation. All directors receive an annual retainer of $50,000 paid in cash. The lead non-employee director received an annual retainer of $25,000. Committee chairmen receive an additional $10,000 retainer per year. In recognition of
the additional time commitment and responsibility, members of the audit committee and

generation oversight committee, including the committee chairs, receive an additional $5,000 per year for their participation on these committees, and the chairmen of these committees receive a
$20,000 annual retainer.            Directors receive $2,000 for each
meeting of the board, board committee or sub-committee that they attend, whether in person or by means of teleconferencing or video conferencing equipment. Directors also receive a $2,000 meeting fee for attending the annual shareholders meeting and
the annual strategy retreat.             Stock Awards    
        Rather than paying directors entirely in cash, Exelon pays a
significant portion of director compensation in the form of deferred stock units. The deferred stock units are not paid out to the directors until they retire from the board, leaving these amounts at risk during the director s entire tenure on
the board. Directors are required under the Exelon Corporate Governance Principles to own 5,000 shares of Exelon common stock or deferred stock units within five years after their election to the board.   
        Directors receive deferred stock units worth $100,000 per year.
Deferred stock units are granted and credited to a notional account maintained on the books of the corporation at the end of each calendar quarter based upon the closing price of Exelon common stock on the day the quarterly dividend is paid.
Deferred stock units earn the same dividends available to all holders of Exelon common stock, which are reinvested in the account as additional units.         
  As of December 31, 2010, the directors held the following amounts of deferred Exelon common stock units. The units are valued at the closing
price of Exelon common stock on December 31, 2010, which was $41.64. Legacy plans include those stock units earned from Exelon s predecessor companies, PECO Energy Company and Unicom Corporation. For Adm. DeMars and Mr. Rogers, the
legacy deferred stock units reflect accrued benefits from the Unicom Directors Retirement Plan (which was terminated in 1997) and the Unicom 1996 Directors Fee Plan (which was terminated in 2000), respectively.

    Deferred Compensation          
  Directors may elect to defer any portion their cash compensation in a non-qualified multi-fund deferred compensation plan. Each director has an
unfunded account where the dollar balance can be invested in one or more of several mutual funds, including one fund composed entirely of Exelon common stock. Fund balances (including those amounts invested in the Exelon common stock fund) will be
settled in cash and may be distributed in a lump sum or in annual installment payments upon a director s reaching age 65, age 72 or upon retirement from the board. These funds are identical to those that are available to executive officers
and are generally identical to those available to company employees who participate in the Exelon Employee Savings Plan. Directors and executive officers have one additional fund not available to employees that, through its composition, provides
returns that can be in excess of 120% of the Federal long-term rate that is used by the IRS to determine above market returns. However, during 2010 none of the directors had investments in this fund.   
         Other Compensation             Exelon pays the cost of a director s spouse s travel, meals, lodging and related activities when the spouses
are invited to attend company or industry related events where it is customary and expected that directors attend with their spouses. The cost of such travel, meals and other activities is imputed to the director as additional taxable income.
However, in most cases there is no incremental cost to Exelon of providing transportation and lodging for a director s spouse when he or she accompanies the director, and the only additional costs to Exelon are those for meals and activities
and to reimburse the director for the taxes on the imputed income. In 2010, incremental cost to the company to provide these perquisites was less than $10,000 per director and the aggregate amount for all directors as a group, a total of 15
directors, was $26,051. The aggregate amount paid to all directors as a group (15 directors) for reimbursement of taxes on imputed income was $23,711.         
  Exelon has a board compensation and expense reimbursement policy under which directors are reimbursed for reasonable travel to and from their
primary residence and lodging expenses incurred when attending board and committee meetings or other events on behalf of Exelon, (including director s orientation or continuing education programs, facility visits or other business related
activities for the benefit of Exelon). Under the policy, Exelon will arrange for its corporate aircraft to transport groups of directors, or when necessary, individual directors, to meetings in order to maximize the time available for meetings and
discussion. Directors may bring their spouses on Exelon s corporate aircraft when they are invited to an Exelon event, and the value of this travel, calculated according to IRS regulations, is imputed to the director as additional taxable
income. Exelon has a matching gift program available to directors and officers that matches their contributions to educational institutions up to $5,000 per year and a matching gift program for other employees that matches their contributions to
educational institutions up to $2,000 per year.             Generation

expenses and to reimburse the director for the taxes on the imputed income. There were no such incremental costs during 2010 and no reimbursements for income taxes paid during 2010.             PECO

         Other significant owners of Exelon stock    
        Shown in the table below are those owners who are known to Exelon to
hold more than 5% of the outstanding common stock. This information is based on the most recent Schedule 13G filed by Capital World Investors and Capital Research Global Investors with the SEC on February 13, 2010 and filed by BlackRock, Inc.
on February 2, 2011.         
          Capital World Investors and
Capital Research Global Investors are each divisions of Capital Research and Management Company. Capital World Investors disclosed in its Schedule 13G that it disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares and it has sole voting power over 3,467,700
shares and sole dispositive power over all shares. Capital Research Global Investors disclosed in its Schedule 13G that it disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares and it has sole voting power over 20,541,220 shares and sole dispositive power
over all shares. BlackRock, Inc. disclosed in its Schedule 13G that it has sole power to vote or to direct the vote and sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of 35,569,861 shares.             Stock Ownership Requirements for Directors and Officers    
        Under Exelon s Corporate Governance Principles, all directors are
required to own within five years after election to the board at least 5,000 shares of Exelon common stock or deferred stock units or shares accrued in the Exelon common stock fund of the directors  deferred compensation plan. The corporate
governance committee utilized an independent compensation consultant who determined that, compared to its peer group, Exelon s ownership requirement is reasonable.   
        Officers of Exelon (and its subsidiaries) are required to own certain
amounts of Exelon common stock, depending on their seniority, by the later of five years after their employment or promotion to their current position. The objective is to encourage officers to think and act like owners. The ownership guidelines are
expressed as both a fixed number of shares and a multiple of annualized base salary to avoid arbitrary changes to the ownership requirements that could arise from ordinary

course volatility in the market price for Exelon s shares. The minimum stock ownership targets by level are the lesser of the fixed number of shares or the multiple of annualized base
salary. The number of shares was determined by taking the following multiples of the officer s base salary as of the latest of September 30, 2010 or the date of hire or promotion: (1) Chairman and CEO, five times base salary;
(2) executive vice presidents, three times base salary; (3) presidents and senior vice presidents, two times base salary; and (4) vice presidents and other executives, one times base salary. Ownership is measured by valuing an
executive s holdings using the 60-day average price of Exelon common stock as of the appropriate date. Shares held outright, earned non-vested performance shares, and deferred shares count toward the ownership guidelines; unvested restricted
stock and stock options do not count for this purpose. As of December 31, 2010, the named executive officers (NEOs) held the following amounts of stock relative to the applicable guidelines:

ITEM 13.   
   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE      
         Exelon    
        The information required by Item 13 relating to transactions with
related persons and director independence is incorporated herein by reference to information to be filed in the 2011 Exelon Proxy Statement.         
   Generation          
  There were no related person transactions involving Generation. Generation does not have a board of directors.   
         ComEd    
        Sidley Austin LLP provided legal services to Exelon and ComEd during
2010. The spouse of Mr. Ruiz, a member of the ComEd board of directors, is a partner of Sidley Austin LLP.         
  The ComEd board of directors has adopted the independence standards of The New York Stock Exchange as its independence standards. In assessing the
independence of its directors, the ComEd board considered the relationships of its directors with Exelon as well as the business and charitable relationships among Exelon, ComEd and businesses and charities with which its directors are affiliated.
With respect to Mr. Ruiz, the ComEd board considered the relationship of his spouse with a law firm that provides legal services to Exelon and ComEd, as disclosed above. The board determined that none of the relationships was material and
accordingly that Messrs. Compton, Ruiz, Mooney, Fazio and Moskow are independent. Messrs. Rowe, Clark, Jannotta, and Thomas and Ms. Gin are all current or former officers or directors of Exelon and, accordingly, are not independent.   
         PECO    
        There were no related person transactions involving PECO. Under
PECO s bylaws, an  independent director  is a director who is not a director, officer or employee of Exelon, PECO or any other Exelon Corporation affiliate (excluding for this purpose positions as directors of PECO or subsidiaries of
PECO). Messrs. Rowe, D Alessio, Diaz, O Brien and Ridge and Ms. Greco are all current officers or directors of Exelon or PECO and, accordingly, are not independent.

ITEM 14.   
   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES            
     Exelon          
  In July 2002, the Exelon Audit Committee (Committee) adopted a policy for pre-approval of services to be performed by the independent accountants.
The Committee pre-approves annual budgets for audit, audit-related and tax compliance and planning services. The services that the Committee will consider include services that do not impair the accountant s independence and add value to the
audit, including audit services such as attest services and scope changes in the audit of the financial statements, audit-related services such as accounting advisory services related to proposed transactions and new accounting pronouncements, the
issuance of comfort letters and consents in relation to financings, the provision of attest services in relation to regulatory filings and contractual obligations, and tax compliance and planning services. With respect to non-budgeted services in
amounts less than $500,000, the Committee delegated authority to the Committee s chairman to pre-approve such services. All other services must be pre-approved by the Committee. The Committee receives quarterly reports on all fees paid to the
independent accountants. None of the services provided by the independent accountants was provided pursuant to the de minimis exception to the pre-approval requirements contained in the SEC s rules.   
        The following table presents fees for professional audit services
rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the audit of Exelon s annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and fees billed for other services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during those periods.
Fees include amounts related to the year indicated, which may differ from amounts billed.

    Audit related fees consist of assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the auditor. This category includes fees for accounting
assistance and due diligence in connection with proposed acquisitions or sales and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.      

(b)   
    Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.
These services included tax compliance and preparation services, including the preparation of original and amended tax returns, claims for refunds, and tax payment planning, and tax advice and consulting services, including assistance and
representation in connection with tax audits and appeals, tax advice related to proposed acquisitions or sales, employee benefit plans and requests for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities.      

(c)   
    All other fees reflect work performed primarily in connection with research and audit software licenses.      
         Generation, ComEd and PECO    
        Generation, ComEd and PECO are indirect controlled subsidiaries of
Exelon. The audit committee function is fulfilled for Generation, ComEd and PECO by the Committee. See ITEM 10. Directors, Executive Officers of the Registrant and Corporate Governance for additional information regarding the Committee. See
discussion under  Exelon  above for a description of the Committee s policy and process for approving services to be performed by the independent accountants on behalf of Exelon, Generation, ComEd and PECO. None of the services
provided by the independent accountants was provided pursuant to the de minimis exception to the pre-approval requirements contained in the SEC s rules.

telex or TWX, when dispatched or, in the case of facsimile transmission, when received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, written notice of any meeting of shareholders may be sent by any class of mail, postage prepaid, so long as such notice is sent at
least 20 calendar days prior to the date of the meeting. A notice of meeting shall specify the place, day and hour of the meeting and any other information required by any other provision of the Business Corporation Law, the articles or these
bylaws.      (b)  Adjourned Shareholder Meetings . When a meeting of shareholders is adjourned, it shall not be necessary to
give any notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting, other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting or
the   

Business Corporation Law requires notice of the business to be transacted and such notice has not previously been given.      Section 2.02  Notice of Meetings of the Board of Directors .      Notice of
a regular meeting of the board of directors need not be given. Notice of every special meeting of the board of directors shall be given to each director by telephone or in writing at least 24 hours (in the case of notice by telephone, telex, TWX,

  Section 2.03  Notice of Meetings of Shareholders .      (a)  General Rule . Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders shall be given by, or at the direction of, the secretary or other authorized person to each shareholder of record entitled to

the person or persons entitled to the notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of the notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, a meeting need be specified in the
waiver of notice of the meeting.      (b)  Waiver by Attendance . Attendance of a person at any meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of the meeting except where a person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.   
  Section 2.05  Modification of Proposal Contained in Notice . Whenever the language of a proposed resolution is included in a
written notice of a meeting required to be given under the   
         2   

provisions of the Business Corporation Law or the articles or these bylaws, the meeting considering the resolution may without further notice adopt it with such clarifying or other amendments as
do not enlarge its original purpose.      Section 2.06  Exception to Requirement of Notice .   
  (a)  General Rule . Whenever any notice or communication is required to be given to any person under the provisions of the Business
Corporation Law or by the articles or these bylaws or by the terms of any agreement or other instrument or as a condition precedent to taking any corporate action and communication with that person is then unlawful, the giving of the notice or
communication to that person shall not be required.      (b)  Shareholders Without Forwarding Addresses . Notice or other
communications need not be sent to any shareholder with whom the corporation has been unable to communicate for more than 24 consecutive months because communications to the shareholder are returned unclaimed or the shareholder has otherwise failed
to provide the corporation with a current address. Whenever the shareholder provides the corporation with a current address, the corporation shall recommence sending notices and other communications to the shareholder in the manner provided by these
bylaws.      Section 2.07  Use of Conference Telephone and Similar Equipment . Any director may participate in any
meeting of the board of directors or a committee thereof, and the board of directors may provide by resolution with respect to a specific meeting of shareholders or with respect to a class of meetings of shareholders that one or more persons may
participate in a meeting of the shareholders of the corporation, by means of conference telephone, video conference or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation in
a meeting pursuant to this Section shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.        ARTICLE III.     
   Shareholders       Section 3.01  Place of Meeting . Meetings of the shareholders of the corporation may be held at such place within or without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as may be designated by the Board of

in such other jurisdiction where such meeting may be held, the next succeeding business day). Failure to hold such meeting at the designated time or on the designated date or to elect some or all of the members of the board at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof shall not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or work a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation. If the annual meeting shall not have   
         3   

been called and held within six months after the designated time, any shareholder may call the meeting at any time thereafter.   
  Section 3.03  Special Meetings . Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by resolution of the board of
directors, which may fix the date, time and place of the meeting, and shall be called as provided in the terms of the Preferred Stock. If the board does not fix the date, time or place of the meeting, it shall be the duty of the secretary to do so.
A date fixed by the secretary shall not be more than 60 calendar days after the date of the action calling the special meeting.   
  Section 3.04  Quorum and Adjournment .      (a)  General Rule . A meeting of the shareholders of the corporation duly called shall not be organized for the transaction of business unless a quorum is present. Except as otherwise provided in the
terms of the Preferred Stock, the presence of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter to be acted upon at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purposes
of consideration and action on the matter. Shares of the corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by it shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares for quorum purposes at any given time.   
  (b)  Withdrawal of a Quorum . The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting can continue to do business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.      (c)  Adjournments Generally . Any
regular or special meeting of the shareholders, including one at which directors are to be elected and one which cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, may be adjourned, except as otherwise provided by the Business Corporation Law,
for such period and to such place as the shareholders present and entitled to vote shall direct.      (d)  Electing Directors at
Adjourned Meeting . Those shareholders entitled to vote who attend a meeting called for the election of directors that has been previously adjourned for lack of a quorum, although less than a quorum as fixed in this Section of these bylaws, shall
nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.      (e)  Other Action in Absence of Quorum . Those
shareholders entitled to vote who attend a meeting of shareholders that has been previously adjourned for one or more periods aggregating at least 15 calendar days because of an absence of a quorum, although less than a quorum as fixed in this
Section of these bylaws, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon any matter set forth in the notice of the meeting if the notice states that those shareholders who attend the adjourned meeting shall nevertheless
constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon the matter.      Section 3.05  Action by Shareholders .   
         4   

(a)  General Rule . Except as otherwise provided in the Business Corporation Law or
the articles or these bylaws, whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders of the corporation, it shall be authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to
vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class, in each case at a duly organized meeting of
shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the Preferred Stock or when acting by unanimous consent to remove a director or directors, the shareholders of the corporation may act only at a duly organized meeting.   
  (b)  Conduct of Business . Only such business will be conducted at an annual or special meeting of shareholders as shall have been
properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or with respect to an annual meeting, by any shareholder who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section.   
  (1) For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given to the
secretary of the corporation timely written notice of the shareholder s intention to make a proposal, in the manner and form prescribed herein, whether or not the proposed business is to be included in the corporation s proxy statement.
     (i) To be timely, a shareholder s notice with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders must be
addressed to the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation and received by the secretary not less than 120 calendar days in advance of the first anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed
its proxy materials to shareholders for the prior year s annual meeting of shareholders, and this notice requirement shall not be affected by any adjournment of said meeting; provided, however, that in the event public announcement of the date
of the annual meeting is not made at least 75 calendar days prior to the date of the annual meeting, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th calendar day following the day on which
public announcement is first made of the date of the annual meeting.      (ii) A shareholder s notice to the
secretary must set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (A) a description in reasonable detail of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such
business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation s books, of the shareholder proposing such business and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C) the class
and number of shares of the corporation and any other ownership interests, including derivatives, hedged positions and other economic or voting interests in the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by the shareholder proposing such
business and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (D) any material interest of such shareholder proposing such business and the beneficial owner, if   
         5   

any, on whose behalf the proposal is made in such business, and (E) a representation as to whether such shareholder intends to deliver a proxy statement regarding such matters to the other
shareholders of the corporation.      (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these bylaws, a shareholder
must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section. For purposes of this Section,
 public announcement  means disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Bloomberg Business News, or Reuters Economic Services or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or publicly filed by the corporation with any national securities exchange or quotation service through which the corporation s stock is listed or traded, or furnished by
the corporation to its shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of the date of the annual meeting is required for the advance notice provision of this Section 3.05 (b) to be effective if the annual meeting is held on such
date as specified in Section 3.02 of these bylaws. Nothing in this Section will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange
Act.      (2) At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as is
properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given in accordance with Section 2.03 of these bylaws or
(ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the total number of directors that the corporation would have if there were no vacancies on the board of directors (the  Whole
Board ).      (3) The determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special
meeting of the shareholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Section of these bylaws will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is not properly brought
before such meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered.   
  Section 3.06  Organization .      (a)  Presiding Officer and Secretary of Meeting . At every meeting of the shareholders, the chairman of the board, or such other officer of the corporation designated by a majority of the Whole
Board, will call meetings of shareholders to order or, in the case of vacancy in office and absence by action of the Whole Board, one of the following officers present in the order stated: The chief executive officer, if there be one, the president,
if there be one, the vice presidents in their order of rank and seniority shall act as  presiding officer  of the meeting. The term  presiding officer  means an officer who presides over a meeting of
  
         6   

shareholders. The secretary or, in the absence of the secretary, an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of both the secretary and assistant secretaries, a person appointed by the presiding
officer of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.      (b)  Rules of Conduct . Unless otherwise determined by
the board of directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of shareholders will determine the order of business and have the authority to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as such
presiding officer deems necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting
and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies, and such other persons as the board of directors or the presiding officer
shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comment by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting on
matters which are to be voted on by ballot. Unless, and to the extent determined by the board of directors or the presiding officer of the meeting, meetings of shareholders need not be conducted in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.
     Section 3.07  Voting Rights of Shareholders . Unless otherwise provided in the articles, every shareholder of the
corporation shall be entitled to one vote for every share standing in the name of the shareholder on the books of the corporation.      Section 3.08  Voting and other Action by Proxy .      (a)
 General Rule .      (1) Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another
person to act for the shareholder by proxy.      (2) The presence of, or vote or other action at a meeting of
shareholders by a proxy of a shareholder shall constitute the presence of, or vote or action by, the shareholder.      (3) Where two or more proxies of a shareholder are present, the corporation shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy, accept as the vote of all shares represented thereby the vote cast by a
majority of them and, if a majority of the proxies cannot agree whether the shares represented shall be voted, or upon the manner of voting the shares, the voting of the shares shall be divided equally among those persons.   
  (b)  Form of Proxy . Every proxy shall be in a form approved by the secretary of the corporation or as otherwise
provided by the Business Corporation Law.      (c)  Revocation . A proxy, unless coupled with an interest,
shall be revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the proxy to the   
         7   

contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective until written notice thereof has been given to the secretary of the corporation. An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three
years from the date of its execution unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. A proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, written notice of the
death or incapacity is given to the secretary of the corporation.      (d)  Expenses . The corporation shall
pay the reasonable expenses of solicitation of votes or proxies of shareholders by or on behalf of the board of directors or its nominees for election to the board, including solicitation by professional proxy solicitors and otherwise.   
  Section 3.09  Voting by Fiduciaries and Pledgees . Shares of the corporation standing in the name of a trustee or other
fiduciary and shares held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors or by a receiver may be voted by the trustee, fiduciary, assignee or receiver. A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote the shares until the shares have
been transferred into the name of the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee, but nothing in this Section shall affect the validity of a proxy given to a pledgee or nominee.      Section 3.10  Voting by Joint Holders of Shares .      (a)  General
Rule . Where shares of the corporation are held jointly or as tenants in common by two or more persons, as fiduciaries or otherwise:      (1) if only one or more of such persons is present in person or by proxy, all of the shares standing in the names of such persons shall be deemed to be represented for the purpose of determining a quorum
and the corporation shall accept as the vote of all the shares the vote cast by a joint owner or a majority of them; and      (2) if the persons are equally divided upon whether the shares held by them shall be voted or upon the manner of voting the shares, the voting of the shares shall be divided equally among the persons
without prejudice to the rights of the joint owners or the beneficial owners thereof among themselves.      (b)  Exception .
If there has been filed with the secretary of the corporation a copy, certified by an attorney-at-law to be correct, of the relevant portions of the agreement under which the shares are held or the instrument by which the trust or estate was created
or the order of court appointing them or of an order of court directing the voting of the shares, the persons specified as having such voting power in the latest document so filed, and only those persons, shall be entitled to vote the shares but
only in accordance therewith.      Section 3.11  Voting by Corporations .   
  (a)  Voting by Corporate Shareholders . Any domestic or foreign corporation for profit or not-for-profit that is a shareholder of
this corporation may vote at meetings of shareholders of this corporation by any of its officers or agents, or by proxy appointed by any   
         8   

officer or agent, unless some other person, by resolution of the board of directors of the other corporation or a provision of its articles or bylaws, a copy of which resolution or provision
certified to be correct by one of its officers has been filed with the secretary of this corporation, is appointed its general or special proxy in which case that person shall be entitled to vote the shares.   
  (b)  Controlled Shares . Shares of this corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by it and controlled, directly or indirectly, by
the board of directors of this corporation, as such, shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares for voting purposes at any given time.   
  Section 3.12  Determination of Shareholders of Record .   
  (a)  Fixing Record Date . The board of directors may fix a time prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders as a record date
for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the meeting, which time, except as otherwise provided in the articles or in the case of an adjourned meeting, shall be not more than 90 calendar days prior to the date
of the meeting of shareholders. Only shareholders of record on the date fixed shall be so entitled notwithstanding any transfer of shares on the books of the corporation after any record date fixed as provided in this Subsection. The board of
directors may similarly fix a record date for the determination of shareholders of record for any other purpose, except that the record date fixed to determine the holders of Preferred Stock entitled to receive dividends thereon shall not precede
the respective dividend payment date by more than 40 calendar days. When a determination of shareholders of record has been made as provided in this Section for purposes of a meeting, the determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless
the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.      (b)  Determination When Record Date Is Not Fixed . If a
record date is not fixed:      (1) The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given.      (2) The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.   
  (c)  Certification by Nominee . The board of directors may adopt a procedure whereby a shareholder of the corporation may certify in
writing to the corporation that all or a portion of the shares registered in the name of the shareholder are held for the account of a specified person or persons. Upon receipt by the corporation of a certification complying with the procedure, the
persons specified in the certification shall be deemed, for the purposes set forth in the certification, to be the holders of record of the number of shares specified in place of the shareholder making the certification.   
         9   

Section 3.13  Voting Lists .   
  (a)  General Rule . The officer or agent having charge of the transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make a complete
list of the shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. The list shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and
shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof except that, if the corporation has 5,000 or more shareholders, in lieu of the making of the list the corporation may make the
information therein available at the meeting by any other means.      (b)  Effect of List . Failure to comply with the
requirements of this Section shall not affect the validity of any action taken at a meeting prior to a demand at the meeting by any shareholder entitled to vote thereat to examine the list. The original share register or transfer book, or a
duplicate thereof kept in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine the list or share register or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.   
  Section 3.14  Judges of Election .      (a)  Appointment . In advance of any meeting of shareholders of the corporation, the board of directors may appoint judges of election, who need not be shareholders, to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof. If judges of election are not so appointed, the presiding officer of the meeting may appoint judges of election at the meeting. The number of judges shall be one or three. A person who is a candidate for an office to be filled
at the meeting shall not act as a judge.      (b)  Vacancies . In case any person appointed as a judge fails to appear or
fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the board of directors in advance of the convening of the meeting or at the meeting by the presiding officer thereof.   
  (c)  Duties . The judges of election shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, receive votes or ballots, hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, count and
tabulate all votes, determine the result and do such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote. The judges of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is
practical. If there are three judges of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority shall be effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all.      (d)  Report . On request of the presiding officer of the meeting or of any shareholder, the judges shall make a report in writing of any challenge or question or matter determined by them, and
execute a certificate of any fact found by them. Any report or certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.   
         10   

Section 3.15  Minors as Security Holders . The corporation may treat a minor who
holds shares or obligations of the corporation as having capacity to receive and to empower others to receive dividends, interest, principal and other payments or distributions, to vote or express consent or dissent and to make elections and
exercise rights relating to such shares or obligations unless, in the case of payments or distributions on shares, the corporate officer responsible for maintaining the list of shareholders or the transfer agent of the corporation or, in the case of
payments or distributions on obligations, the treasurer or paying officer or agent has received written notice that the holder is a minor.        ARTICLE IV.         Board of Directors    
  Section 4.01  Powers .      (a)  General Rule . Unless otherwise provided by statute, all powers vested by law in the corporation shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation

the votes cast, the resignation of such nominee referred to in Section 4.03 will be automatically accepted. If the nominee is an incumbent director who is standing for re-election and such nominee receives a plurality of the votes cast but does
not receive a majority of the votes cast, the committee of the board authorized to nominate candidates for election to the board will make a recommendation to the board on whether to accept the director s resignation or whether other action
should be taken. The director not receiving a majority of the votes cast will not participate in the committee s recommendation or the board s decision regarding the tendered resignation. The independent members of the board will consider
the committee s recommendation and publicly disclose the board s decision and the basis for that decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the final election results. If less than two members of the committee are
elected at a meeting for the election of directors, the independent members of the board who were elected shall consider and act upon the tendered resignation. For purposes of this paragraph, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of
shares voted  for  must exceed the number of shares voted  against  with respect to that director s election.      Section 4.03  Number and Term of Office .      (a)  Number . The board

nominee who is an incumbent director, the board accepts the resignation.      (e)  Annual Election of Board of Directors .

annual meeting of the shareholders for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of the shareholders; provided that any director who was elected prior to the 2008 annual meeting of the shareholders for a term that extends until after the
2008 annual meeting of shareholders shall not be required to stand for election, and shall continue as a director until the annual meeting at which the director s term expires.

         15

Section 7.01 or 7.02 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 calendar days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the
applicable period shall be 20 calendar days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce
a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Business Corporation Law.
Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Business Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.
In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the corporation.      Section 7.04  Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the articles, these bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.      Section 7.05  Insurance . The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation,

     Section 7.06  Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation . The corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the

on behalf of the Company and further to align the economic interest of such individuals with those of the Company s shareholders. This Plan is intended to constitute a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The Plan is a restatement of the

5.  
   Award of Units         5.01
 Initial Award of Units . Each Director who is a Participant on the Effective Date is granted a number of Units equal to (i) the present value of benefits accrued by that Director through December 31, 1996 under the PECO Energy
Company Directors  Retirement Plan (the  Retirement Plan ) (or, if the Participant is credited with fewer than five Years of Service under the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 1996, the present value of the product of 10% of
the Participant s 1996 retainer and the number of Years of Service with which the Participant is credited under the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 1996), as determined by an actuary appointed by the Board, divided by (ii) the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock on December 31, 1996.      5.02  Annual Award of Units . On the last day of each
calendar quarter beginning before April 1, 1999, each Participant who is a Director on that date shall receive an award of 178.75 Units. On the last day of each calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 1999 and before October 1,
2000, each Participant who is a Director on that date shall receive an award of 250 Units. On the last day of each calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 2000, each Participant who is a Director on that date shall receive an award of a
number of Units equal to the quotient of $12,500 divided by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date for the payment of a dividend occurring in such calendar quarter. Such awarded Units shall be credited to each Participant s
Account as specified in Section 5.04 below. The Board may review the annual award under this Section 5.02 periodically and amend the Plan to adjust such award if and to the extent appropriate.   
  5.03  Dividend Equivalents . From the date of grant of each Unit to a Participant until the Participant s Account has been
fully distributed, the Company shall credit to each Participant s Account on each date for the payment of a dividend by the Company on its Common Stock, a number of Units equal to (i) the Dividend Equivalent for such dividend payment date,
divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such   
         -3-

dividend payment date. If Units are awarded under Section 5.02 and this Section 5.03 as of the same date, the award under this Section 5.03 shall be determined before any Units are
credited to a Participant s Account under Section 5.02.      5.04  Accounts . The Company shall keep records to
reflect the number of Units credited to each Participant hereunder; provided, however, that (i) this Plan shall be unfunded, (ii) the Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation
of assets to assure redemption of Units granted under this Plan, and (iii) no Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific assets of the Company. Fractional Units shall accumulate
in the Participant s Account and shall be added together to create whole Units. Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any
Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.   
  5.05  Adjustments . If there is any change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (i) by reason of a spin-off,
recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) by reason of a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the Company is the surviving corporation, (iii) by reason of a reclassification or change in par
value, or (iv) by reason of any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Company s receipt of consideration, the number of Units credited to Participants  Accounts shall be
appropriately adjusted by the Committee to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock to preclude, to the extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under this Plan. Any adjustments
determined by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. If and to the extent that any such change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding is effected solely by application of a mathematical formula (e.g., a 2-for-1 stock
split), the adjustment described in this Section 5.05 shall be made and shall occur automatically by application of such formula, without further action by the Committee.   

6.  
   Events Requiring Redemption of Units         6.01  Separation from Service .      (a) The Units credited
to a Participant s Account shall be distributed to the Participant in, or beginning in, the month of April of the year next beginning after the occurrence of one of the following distribution events, as the Participant shall direct in a benefit
distribution election form submitted in accordance with procedures established by the Company (a  Benefit Distribution Election Form ): (i) the Participant s Separation from Service or (ii) the Participant s 72   nd    birthday. Distributions shall be paid in a lump sum payment or in
annual installments over a period of up to 10 years, as the Participant shall direct in his or her Benefit Distribution Election Form. Except as provided in Section 6.01(c), any distribution shall be paid in the form of whole shares of Common
Stock and cash in an amount equal to the Unit Value of any remaining fractional Unit. If a Participant elects to receive installments, Dividend Equivalents will be credited to such Participant s Account in accordance with Section 5 until
the full amount of the Participant s Account has been distributed. Each installment payment shall   
         -4-

include shares of Common Stock equal to the largest number of whole Units determined by dividing the Participant s total Account balance as of such payment date by the number of payments
remaining in the installment period, and the last such installment shall also include cash in an amount equal to the Unit Value of any remaining fractional Unit. In the event a Participant who has elected a distribution event based on his or her
65th or 72nd birthday continues to serve as a Director after the date such distributions commence, then in the year prior to the year in which such distributions commence such Director shall file a new Benefit Distribution Election Form governing
any amounts credited to his or her Deferral Account after the date such distributions commence. If the Director does not file such new Benefit Distribution Election Form, then the Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive a lump sum
distribution of any such amounts upon the Director s separation from service.      (b) Except as permitted under
Section 6.01(c) or 6.01(d), each Director must submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form not later than 30 days after the date on which such Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (provided that a Director who participated
in the Plan prior to January 1, 2009 and had not commenced distributions must have submitted such form not later than December 31, 2008). If a Director does not submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form during this period, then such
Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive his or her Account balance in the form of a lump sum payable upon the Director s Separation from Service.      (c) Notwithstanding Sections 6.01(a) and 6.01(b), each Participant who had not commenced and was not scheduled to commence the receipt of distributions under the Plan on or before December 31, 2007
was permitted to submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form on or before June 30, 2007 which provided for the payment of such Participant s Account (i) at any of the times and in any of the forms permitted under Section 6.01(a)
of the Plan or (ii) in a lump sum payment in the first quarter of 2008; provided that such election did not cause any payment to be made in 2007 and did not apply to any payment that otherwise would be paid in 2007. If a Participant elected to
receive a lump sum payment of his or her Account in the first quarter of 2008, such payment was paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the election of the Participant, provided that such Participant was permitted to
elect to receive such payment in cash only to the extent the Participant had otherwise satisfied his or her share ownership requirements under the Company s share ownership policy. The special election right set forth in this Section was
intended to comply with the transition rule set forth in IRS Notice 2005-1, Q A-19(c), and extended in the preamble to regulations proposed under Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2006-79, which permits participants in deferred
compensation plans to change the date on which deferred compensation is payable.      (d) A Participant may elect to change the
time and/or method of his or her distributions payable under the Plan in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee; provided that, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, any such change in a distribution election
(i) shall not be effective until 12 months after it is submitted to the Committee, (ii) must be submitted to the Committee at least 12 months prior to the date on which such distributions were previously scheduled to commence and
(iii) must provide for distributions to commence at least five years after the date on which such distributions were previously scheduled to commence.   
         -5-

6.02  Death . If a Participant dies before any Units credited to his or her Account
have been redeemed in accordance with Section 6.01, whether death occurs before or after a Separation from Service, the Company shall redeem all of the Units credited to the Participant s Account as of the date of his or her death and
distribute to the Participant s Beneficiary as soon as practicable, in a single distribution, shares of Common Stock equal to the number of whole Units credited to the Participant s Account as of the date of his or her death and cash in an
amount equal to the Unit Value of any remaining fractional Unit.      6.03  Common Stock for Redemption of Units . Shares
distributed to redeem Units may be authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or reacquired shares of Common Stock, including treasury shares and shares purchased by the Company on the open market for purposes of the Plan.

  7.02  No Rights as Shareholder . No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of the Company, including the right to any
cash dividends, or the right to vote, as a result of the grant to the Participant, or the Participant s holding of, any Units.      7.03  Adjustment Upon Acquisitions, Dispositions or other Events not in the Ordinary Course of Business.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company s financial performance
is affected by any event that is of a non-recurring nature, including an acquisition or disposition of the assets or stock of a business, the Board, in its sole discretion, may make such adjustments in the number of Units or the Unit Value of each
Unit for the then current Plan Year as it shall determine to be equitable and appropriate in order to make the value of each Unit, as nearly as may be practicable, equivalent to the value of the Unit immediately prior to such event.   
  7.04  No Rights to Service . Nothing in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant hereto, shall affect the Participant s term of
service as a Director.      7.05  Notices . Any notice hereunder to be given to the Company shall be in writing and shall be
delivered in person to the Secretary of the Company, or shall be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at the Company s executive offices, and any notice hereunder to be given to the Participant
shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person to the Participant, or shall be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Participant at his last address as shown in the employment records of the Company. Any notice duly mailed
in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed given on the date postmarked.      7.06  Termination and Amendment of
the Plan/Modification of Units . The Plan may be altered, amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Board, provided that, except as otherwise provided herein or as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, no such action shall
result in the distribution of amounts credited to the Accounts of any Participant at any time other than as provided in the Plan or as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, nor shall such
  
         -6-

action reduce the Units credited to any Participant s Account. To the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the Board may, in its discretion, terminate the Plan and
accelerate the payment of all Accounts:      (a) within 12 months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the
Code, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  503(b)(1)(A), provided that the payments with respect to each such Account are included in the Director s gross income in the later of (i) the calendar year in
which the Plan termination occurs or (ii) the first calendar year in which the payments are administratively practicable;   
  (b) in connection with a  change in control event,  as defined in, and to the extent permitted under, Treasury regulations
promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or      (c) upon any other termination event permitted under Section 409A of
the Code.      7.07  Incompetents . If the Committee shall find that any person to whom any payment is payable under this
Plan is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian, committee or other legal representative) may be paid to the
spouse, a child, a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the Committee to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment, in such manner and proportions as the Committee may determine. Any such payment shall
be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the Company under this Plan.      7.08  Compliance With Section 409A of the
Code.  The Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. The Company shall have the discretion and authority to amend the Plan at any time to satisfy any

restatement of the Commonwealth Edison Company Service Annuity System as in effect on December 31, 2009 and, except as otherwise provided, shall apply to Employees whose employment is terminated on or after January 1, 2010 and to the

determined under the Commonwealth Edison Company Service Annuity System as in effect at the time of such Employees  termination, including any provisions of this Plan effective at such time; provided, however, that the provisions of Article 7
(relating to limitations on benefits), Article 9 (relating to special rules relating to participation of and distribution to certain terminated or transferred employees), Article 10 (relating to administration), Article 13 (relating to miscellaneous
provisions) and Article 15 (relating to amendment and termination of the Plan) shall be effective for all such persons.      For
purposes of the Plan, the phrase  a member of IBEW Local Union 15  shall mean an employee whose terms of employment are subject to a collective bargaining agreement between IBEW Local Union 15 and his or her employer.   
  2.      DEFINITIONS
     A.  Defined Terms . As used herein the following words and phrases shall have the following respective meanings when
capitalized unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:       Administrator . The Vice President,
Compensation   Benefits or such other person appointed pursuant to Section 10.1.   
   Affiliate . (a) A corporation which is a member of the same controlled group of corporations (within the
meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code) as an Employer, (b) a trade or   

business (whether or not incorporated) under common control (within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code) with an Employer, (c) an organization (whether or not incorporated) that
is a member of an affiliated service group (within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code) that includes an Employer, a corporation described in clause (a) of this subdivision or a trade or business described in clause (b) of this
subdivision, or (d) any other entity that is required to be aggregated with an Employer pursuant to Regulations promulgated under Section 414(o) of the Code.   
   Annuity Starting Date . The first day on which a Service Annuity is payable to a Participant.   
   Basic Compensation . A Participant s base pay rate per pay period, as determined by the Administrator. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, a Participant s base pay rate per pay period shall include (i) any amount contributed by the Participant s Employer on behalf of such Participant for such year to the Participant s Before-Tax
Contributions Account under the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan, a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan described in section 132(f) of the Code, the Exelon Corporation Benefits Contribution Options or the Exelon Corporation Key
Choices Program and (ii) such other types of compensation or payments as may be determined by the Administrator from time to time or as may be set forth from time to time in Exhibit 1 attached hereto, and shall exclude (i) bonuses (other

other types of compensation or payments as may be determined by the Administrator from time to time or as may be set forth from time to time in Exhibit 1 attached hereto. In the case of a Participant who is absent from employment due to either an
authorized leave of absence (including a leave of absence for participation in Military Service) or employment by a union that represents any group of Employees, Basic Compensation shall mean, for the period during which the Participant is absent
due to an authorized leave of absence or employment by such union, the Participant s base pay rate per pay period in effect immediately preceding the first day of the Participant s authorized leave of absence or employment by a union, as
the case may be. A Participant whose Termination of Employment occurs on account of a Total and Permanent Disability, but who is not then eligible for a Service Annuity under Section 5.2 (relating to normal and deferred retirement),
Section 5.3 (relating to early retirement), Section 5.4 (relating to disability retirement at or after age 45) or Section 5.5 (relating to disability retirement before age 45) shall not be treated as having any Basic Compensation for
periods of Credited Service after such Termination of Employment. A Participant whose Termination of Employment occurs on account of a Total and Permanent Disability and who is receiving benefits under any Employer s long term disability plan
shall be treated for periods of Credited Service after such Termination of Employment as having Basic Compensation determined under Section 5.2(c).       Beneficiary .

Price Index (U.S. City Average 1967 = 100). Such term shall also mean such index as it may from time to time be changed or, if it shall be discontinued, the most nearly comparable index, appropriately adjusted to yield results comparable with those
which would have been produced if the index as defined in the preceding sentence had been used, as determined by the Investment Fiduciary.       Corporate Investment Committee . The committee consisting of the executives or other persons designated from time to time in the charter of such Committee.   
   Credited Service . The period of a Participant s employment as an Eligible Employee which is used to compute

includes (a) the Participant s Credited Service prior to the Effective Date determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to the Effective Date, (b) to the extent not duplicative, for a Participant who
terminated employment prior to January 1, 2003, any additional service for actual employment credited to such Participant prior to the Effective Date in an Employer s employment records pursuant to Commonwealth Edison Company s
service bridging policy, and (c) the period beginning on the Effective Date during which the Participant shall have been an Eligible Employee, including, (i) any period during which the Participant is in Military Service, provided that the
Participant returns to the employ of an Employer within the period prescribed by laws relating to the reemployment rights of persons in Military Service, (ii) any period during which the Participant is employed by a union that represents any
group of Employees, (iii) any period for which back pay is awarded to the Participant and pursuant to which award the Participant is required to receive Credited Service under the Plan, (iv) the period following Termination of Employment

period of absence and (ii) the number of years of such period of absence from employment is less than five.

permanent physical or mental disability, as certified by the medical director of the Company or by such other licensed physician designated by the Administrator, that causes such Child to be unable to engage in substantial gainful employment, and is
a dependent of the Participant within the meaning of Section 152 of the Code (determined by disregarding any age limitation contained in Section 152 of the Code).   
   Earnings . The Participant s earnings during the Participant s period of Credited Service on and before
December 25, 1994 determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to April 1, 1995.       Effective Date .

individual who is on an authorized leave of absence, and (b) on or after January 1, 2001, any Employee whose first Hour of Service with an Employer is prior to January 1, 2009 and who (i) is a member of IBEW Local Union 15 who
becomes initially employed at a facility that, as of October 19, 2000, was owned by Commonwealth Edison Company, Unicom Corporation or any affiliate of Unicom Corporation, (ii) elects to participate in this Plan and (iii) is either
receiving regular salary or wages from and rendering services to an Employer, or is on an authorized leave of absence; but, in either case excluding (i) an Employee the terms of whose employment are subject to a collective bargaining agreement
that does not provide for participation in this Plan, (ii) an Employee paid on the temporary payroll of an Employer who has never completed at least 1,000 Hours of Service in any period of twelve consecutive months beginning with the
Employee s date of hire or anniversary thereof, (iii) an Employee who executes a written waiver of his or her right to participate in the Plan; and (iv) an individual who performs services for an Employer, pursuant to an agreement
(written or oral) that classifies such individual s relationship with the Employer as other than an Employee regardless of whether such individual is at any time determined to be an Employee. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to
the contrary, any Employer may, at the time such Employer elects to participate in this Plan in the manner described in Section 11.1 (relating to adoption of the Plan), designate, with the consent of the Company, a specified group of Employees
who will be Eligible Employees. In the case of Unicom Thermal Technologies Inc. ( Unicom Thermal ), the term  Eligible Employee  shall mean only those persons rendering service to Unicom Thermal who (i) formerly were
employed by the Company, (ii) transferred from the employment of the Company to the employment of Unicom Thermal at the request of the Company, (iii) are otherwise described in the definition of Eligible Employee set forth in this
subdivision (16) and (iv) completed at least ten years of Credited Service under the Plan at the time of transfer from the employment of the Company to the employment of Unicom Thermal; provided, however, any such Employee who had at least
eight years of Credited Service at the time of such transfer shall continue to be an Eligible Employee in the Plan until such Employee completes ten years of Credited Service. In the case of any individual who, as of December 31, 2000, was an
Employee of Commonwealth Edison Company and who subsequently transfers employment to employment with the Exelon Power Team, such individual shall remain an Eligible Employee through the second anniversary of the date of such transfer of employment,
and shall not thereafter be an Eligible Employee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual who, as of December 31, 2000, was an Employee of Commonwealth Edison Company and who transferred employment to employment with the Exelon
Power Team shall be an Eligible Employee as of January 1, 2004, and, without limiting the preceding clause, an individual who transfers employment from employment with an Employer to employment with the Exelon Power Team during 2003 and who was
an Eligible Employee immediately prior to such transfer shall continue to be an Eligible Employee until December 31, 2003 and each individual who transfers employment from the Exelon Power Team to an Employer during 2003 shall not be an
Eligible Employee prior to January 1, 2004. In the case of Exelon Services Inc., the term  Eligible Employee  shall be limited to those Employees of Exelon Services Inc. who were on the payroll of Unicom Energy Solutions as of
April 1, 2001 and are otherwise Eligible Employees.       Employee . An individual whose relationship
with an Employer is, under common law, that of an employee.       Employer . Exelon Corporation, Commonwealth
Edison Company, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (but only with respect to Participants who, as of October 19, 2000, were Participants whose Employer was Commonwealth Edison Company), any other Affiliate that was an Employer under the Plan on
December 31, 2000 and, on or after January 1, 2001, any other Affiliate that, with the consent of Exelon Corporation, elects to participate in the Plan in the   
         -4-

manner described in Section 11.1 (relating to adoption of the Plan) either with respect to all Employees or a specified group of Employees of such Affiliate and any successor Affiliate that
adopts this Plan pursuant to Article 12 (relating to continuance by a successor). If any entity described in the preceding sentence withdraws from participation in the Plan pursuant to Section 15.3 (relating to termination of the Plan by an
Employer), such entity shall thereupon cease to be an Employer.       ERISA . The Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended.       Federal Benefit . The annual amount of full old age benefits which
would be payable to the Participant under the Federal Social Security Act at the age at which full old age benefits would be payable to such Participant under such Act. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of the Federal Benefit
and the age at which full old age benefits become payable shall be determined as of December 25, 1994 in accordance with the provisions of the Plan as in effect on such date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, solely for purposes of
Section 5.6 (relating to Federal Benefit supplemental payments), the amount of Federal Benefit and the age at which full old age benefits become payable shall be determined at the time of a Participant s Termination of Employment by using
the terms of the Federal Social Security Act as in effect at such time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of Federal Benefit shall be computed by using an estimated wage history determined by applying a salary scale based on the
actual change in the average national wage from year to year as determined by the Social Security Administration, projected backwards, to the Participant s compensation subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (other than
the Medicare portion) for the calendar year ending immediately prior to the Participant s Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall a Participant s Federal Benefit be greater than the Federal
Benefit determined by using a wage history that assumes the Participant earned no compensation for periods prior to employment with the Company and Affiliates and uses actual compensation paid by the Company and Affiliates for periods of employment
with the Company and Affiliates and, in the case of a Participant who is absent from employment due to employment by a union that represents any group of Employees, uses actual compensation paid by such union for periods of employment with such
union.       Highest Average Annual Pay . The sum of a Participant s average annual Basic Compensation
and Incentive Pay (a) with respect to any Participant who, as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Employment, is not a member of IBEW Local Union 15, during the four consecutive years (104 biweekly pay periods), and
(b) with respect to any Participant who, as of the date of the Participant s Termination of Employment, is a member of IBEW Local Union 15, during which such average annual Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay was the highest, or
(c) during all years of the Participant s Credited Service if such Credited Service is less than 104 or 78 biweekly pay periods, as applicable. In determining whether a Participant has 104 or 78 consecutive biweekly pay periods, as
applicable, any period of uncompensated absence from employment with an Employer, other than an absence due to participation in Military Service shall be disregarded. In computing  Highest Average Annual Pay,  the total of the Basic
Compensation and Incentive Pay for a Participant for the applicable consecutive pay periods shall be multiplied, in the case of 104 pay periods by 0.25068654 and in the case of 78 pay periods by 0.33424872; provided, that in the case of a
Participant whose years of Credited Service include fewer than 104 or 78 pay periods, as applicable, the multiplier shall be a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the quotient of (a) the number of 14-day
periods during each 365-day period (or if less, during the Participant s Credited Service) and (b) the number of pay periods during the Participant s years of Credited Service. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in computing an Employee s Highest Average Annual Pay, the aggregate amount of the Employee s Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay in excess of the following limits shall not be taken into account: (i) for Plan Years ending
before January 1, 1996, $200,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost of living pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Code for the year in which the computation of Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay is being made), (ii) for Plan Years
beginning on or after January 1, 1996 and before January 1,   
         -5-

2002, $150,000 (adjusted for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17) of the Code), and (iii) for all Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002,
$200,000 (adjusted for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17) of the Code). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the limit determined with respect to clause (i) for the last year for which the computation
is made shall be applied for such year and all preceding years. For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1997, the Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay of an Employee who is a 5% owner of Commonwealth Edison Company or any Affiliate or one of
the ten employees of Commonwealth Edison Company and all Affiliates who was paid the greatest compensation (as defined in Section 415 of the Code) for the Plan Year shall include the Basic Compensation and Incentive Pay of the Employee s
spouse and any lineal descendants of the Employee who have not attained age 19 before the close of the Plan Year.       Hour of Service . (a) Each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of duties (such hours to be credited to the Employee for the computation period or
periods in which the duties are performed); (b) each hour for which an Employee is paid, or entitled to payment, on account of a period of time during which no duties are performed (irrespective of whether a Termination of Employment has
occurred) due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty or leave of absence (such hours to be credited to the Employee for the computation period or periods in which the period of time during
which no duties are performed occurs); and (c) each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by an Employer (such hours to be credited to the Employee for the computation period or periods
in which the award or agreement pertains rather than the computation period in which the award, agreement or payment is made). Hours of Service shall be computed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 2530.200b-2 of the
Department of Labor Regulations.       Incentive Pay . The payments, if any, earned by the Participant with
respect to each year of Credited Service after 1994, regardless of when paid, under the plans set forth in Exhibit 2 attached hereto. Incentive Pay shall also include with respect to each year of Credited Service commencing after December 31,
2002, lump sum merit increases paid during such year of Credited Service. In the case of a Participant who is absent from employment due to employment by a union that represents any group of Employees, Incentive Pay shall mean, for the period during
which the Participant is absent from employment, the payments the Participant would have received under the applicable plan set forth in Exhibit 2 attached hereto, as determined by the union employing such Participant.   
   Investment Fiduciary . The Company acting through the Exelon Investment Office.   
   Military Service . The performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a  uniformed service 
(as defined below) under competent authority of the United States government and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which a person
is absent from employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term  uniformed service  means the Armed Forces, the Army National
Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President
of the United States in time of war or emergency.       Normal Retirement Age . A Participant s 65th
birthday.       Participant . An Employee described in Article 3 (relating to participation). An individual
shall cease to be a Participant upon the date the individual is no longer eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan or upon the individual s Termination of Employment if the individual has not completed at least five years of Vesting Service
upon the date of his or her Termination of Employment and is not otherwise eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan.

provided in a qualified domestic relations order as described in paragraph (b) of Section 13.2 (relating to exception to nonassignability in the case of a qualified domestic relations order) or paragraph (c) of Section 6.6

Participant s Annuity Starting Date.       Termination of Employment . A Participant s ceasing to be
an Employee of any Employer or any Affiliate. A transfer between employment by an Employer and employment by an Affiliate or between employment by Employers or Affiliates shall not constitute a Termination of Employment.

Participant s base pay rate per pay period in effect immediately preceding the first day of the Participant s absence due to such Total and Permanent Disability increased each October 1 following the Participant s Termination of
Employment at a rate equal to the cost of living adjustment described in the following sentence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the cost of living adjustment shall equal, for each October 1, the percentage by which the Consumer

aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding such period.      If the percentage increase in the Consumer

preceding twelve-month period shall continue in effect during such twelve-month period beginning on October 1.      The aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning on October 1 shall not be more than seven percentage points greater than that for the preceding twelve-month
  
         -15-

preceding twelve-month period, the excess shall be carried over to succeeding twelve-month periods until such excess is reduced to zero.      The adjustment percentage for the twelve-month period beginning with the October 1 next following the date the Participant s Termination of Employment occurs shall be the adjustment percentage
determined in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 5.2(c) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of full calendar months between such date and such October 1 and the denominator of which
shall be twelve.      The adjustment described in this Section 5.2(c) shall continue to be made unless and until the Participant ceases to be
eligible to receive benefits under any Employer s long term disability plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Participant returns to employment with any Employer and ceases to be eligible to receive benefits under any
Employer s long term disability plan but again becomes eligible to receive such benefits as a continuation of the same Total and Permanent Disability, as determined under the provisions, or interpretations, of the Employer s long term
disability plan, the adjustments described in this Section 5.2(c) shall continue to be made as though the Participant had never ceased to be eligible for such benefits, provided that an adjustment shall be made for any earnings received by the

Eligible Participant shall be treated (solely for purposes of Section 5.3) as though his or her Termination of Employment occurred on the  Determination Date  (defined in subparagraph (iii) below). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, an  Eligible Participant  shall mean a Participant whose Termination of Employment occurs as a result of the sale of any of the assets sold as part of a divestiture process commencing in 1998 of the Company s fossil-fired
generation facilities to one or more purchasers, provided that, on the  Determination Date  (defined in subparagraph (iii) below), such Participant (a) has attained at least age 50 and (b) has at least ten years of Credited
Service, including as Credited Service any period between the Participant s actual Termination of Employment date and the  Determination Date  (defined in subparagraph (iii) below).

Service), provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment with an Employer and then terminated such employment on account of such Participant s death.      I.  Post Retirement Adjustments . The annual Service Annuity payable pursuant to this Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) and Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms) that commences by

(relating to early retirement), Section 5.4 (relating to disability retirement at or after age 45), Section 5.5 (relating to disability retirement before age 45) or Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested terminations), or
(b) the Termination of Employment of the Participant after the Effective Date by reason of the Participant s death shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 5.9, be adjusted each October 1 for the twelve-month
period then beginning by adding a post-retirement cost of living adjustment computed by applying an adjustment percentage to the appropriate base specified in this Section 5.9.   
  1. The adjustment percentage shall equal, for each October 1, the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the July
immediately preceding such October 1 exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the July immediately preceding the twelve-month period beginning October 1 in which the Participant terminated employment under circumstances described in the first
sentence of this Section 5.9 or payment of a Service Annuity commenced; provided, however, that:      If, as
of such October 1, there shall be no such excess, the adjustment percentage shall be deemed to be zero for the twelve-month period beginning on such October 1.   
  There shall be no negative adjustment percentage.   
         -25-

The aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning
October 1 shall never be lower than the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding such period.      If
the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index computed for the twelve-month period beginning on October 1 does not exceed the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period by at least three percentage points, the
aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period shall continue in effect during such twelve-month period beginning on October 1.      The aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning on October 1 shall not be more than seven percentage points greater than that for the preceding twelve-month period. If the
aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning on October 1 exceeds by more than seven percentage points the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period, the excess shall be carried over to
succeeding twelve-month periods until such excess is reduced to zero.      The adjustment percentage for the
twelve-month period beginning with the October 1 next following the date the Participant s Service Annuity commences shall be the adjustment percentage determined in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 5.9
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of full calendar months between such date and such October 1 and the denominator of which shall be twelve.

the date of his or her Termination of Employment is a member of IBEW Local Union 15, in the case of a Service Annuity payable to a Participant pursuant to this Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) or Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity

Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities), subject to a maximum monthly adjustment of $1,000 or, if the monthly amount of such Service Annuity is less than $1,000 per month, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment equal to the monthly Service

Section 6.3 to the surviving Spouse of a deceased Participant, a family annuity payable pursuant to Section 6.2 to a surviving Dependent Minor Child or Children of a deceased Participant or a surviving dependent s annuity payable
pursuant to Section 6.4 to a surviving Dependent Disabled Child or Children of a deceased Participant, the adjustment percentage shall be applied to the first $250 per month of such annuity or benefit, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment of
$350 ($500 in the case of a marital annuity under paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 or under Section 6.2) or, if the monthly amount of such annuity or benefit is less than $350 ($500 in the case of marital annuity under paragraph
(b) of Section 6.1 or under Section 6.2), subject to a maximum monthly adjustment equal to   
         -26-

the monthly Service Annuity payment. Cost of living adjustments with respect to Service Annuities not described in the first sentence of this Section 5.9(a) shall be determined under the
terms of the Plan as in effect at the time the adjustment was made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cost of living adjustments provided under this Section 5.9(a) may be the subject of bargaining between Commonwealth Edison

Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Administrator shall give the Participant by mail or personal delivery written notice in nontechnical language that, if the Participant is eligible, the Participant may elect an optional form of Service
Annuity set forth in Section 6.2 (relating to optional Service Annuity forms). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Administrator may deliver such notice to the Participant less than 30 days before the Participant s Annuity Starting
Date, provided that (i) the Participant and the Participant s spouse (if any) waive any requirement that such notice be provided no less than 30 days before the Participant s Annuity Starting Date and (ii) payment of the
Participant s Service Annuity commences more than 7 days after such notice is received by the Participant. The notice referred to herein shall mean a notice written in nontechnical language that includes a general description of the benefit
forms provided under the Plan, including the terms and conditions of the basic benefit forms provided under the Plan and the circumstances under which such forms will be provided unless the Participant elects otherwise, with applicable spousal
consent, a description of the eligibility conditions for and any material features of the optional forms of benefit, general information on the relative financial effect upon a Participant s benefit if he elects an optional form of benefit or
revokes any prior election, and a description of the relative value of the optional forms of benefit as compared to a marital annuity. In no event shall payment of a Participant s monthly benefits commence before the notice is made available to
the Participant and he has had an opportunity to make the election described in Section 6.1(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice described in the previous paragraph may be provided
  
         -35-

to the Participant subsequent to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, if the Participant so elects, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:   
  the date the on which the first payment to be received by the Participant is made (the  initial payment date )
shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early as the seventh day after such notice is provided if (i) such notice clearly
indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided under the Plan and to elect (with spousal consent) an optional form of benefit,
(ii) the Participant affirmatively elects a form of distribution with the consent of his or her spouse (if required) to commence as of the initial payment date, and (iii) the Participant is permitted to revoke such election until the
initial payment date;      the notice shall be provided to the Participant no more than ninety (90) days
before the initial payment date, however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)- day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;   
  the Participant is not permitted to elect an Annuity Starting Date that precedes the date upon which the Participant could
have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in effect on the Annuity Starting Date;   
  to the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for the period from the Annuity Starting Date to the
initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the period beginning on the Annuity Starting Date
and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in the preceding sentence
shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Annuity Starting Date on or after January 1, 2008, the interest rate used to compute the adjustment described in
the sentence above shall be the interest rate as specified or prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, in revenue rulings, notices or other guidance for November of the
preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 7.1 of the Plan, the limitations set forth therein shall comply with the adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with respect to any Annuity Starting Date described in
this paragraph which is a  retroactive annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and      if a Participant who is married elects to commence the Participant s benefit as of the initial payment date pursuant to this paragraph, then the Participant s spouse (including an alternate
payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified domestic relations order), determined as of the initial payment date, must consent to such election if the survivor benefits payable as of the Annuity Starting Date are less
than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in Section 6.2(b) of the Plan as of the initial payment date.      2.  Election of Optional Form of Service Annuity . Subject to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided by, this paragraph, a Participant may, at any time during the 90-day period ending on the
Participant s Annuity Starting Date, elect, change or revoke (i) any form of Service Annuity provided under this Plan and (ii) the percentage of the Participant s Service Annuity to be paid to a Spouse under a marital annuity, to
a   
         -36-

Dependent Minor Child under a family annuity or to a Dependent Disabled Child under a surviving dependent s annuity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the written notice described
in paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to the Participant within 30 days of, or after, the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant may make an election, change or revocation as described in the preceding
sentence at any time within 30 days after the date the written notice described in paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to the Participant. The Participant and the Participant s Spouse, if any, may waive the 30 day period
described in the preceding sentence and begin receiving payment of the Participant s Service Annuity prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, provided that distribution of the Participant s Service Annuity commences more than 7 days
after the notice described in paragraph (a) of this Section 6.6 is delivered to the Participant. An election, change or revocation described in this paragraph (b) shall be made by delivering a written notice describing the election,
change or revocation to the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is married on the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant s election to receive an optional form of Service Annuity under
Section 6.2 (relating to optional Service Annuity forms) in lieu of the marital annuity described in paragraph (b) of Section 6.1 (relating to annuities payable to married Participants) shall not be effective unless (i) it shall
have been consented to at the time of such election in writing by the Participant s Spouse and such consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by either a Plan representative or a notary public, or (ii) it is
established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that such consent cannot be obtained because the Participant s Spouse cannot be located or because of such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. An election of an
optional Service Annuity form shall be deemed a rejection of the basic Service Annuity form provided in Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment). The consent of a Spouse required by this paragraph shall not be
necessary for a distribution required by a qualified domestic relations order described in paragraph (b) of Section 13.2.      3.  Automatic Cancellation of Elections . If a Participant s Service Annuity is payable in the form of a marital annuity and if, prior to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the
Participant s spouse dies or the Participant and such spouse divorce, the Participant s election or deemed election to receive a marital annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or divorce, be
automatically cancelled, unless, subsequent to such spouse s death or the Participant s divorce and prior to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant remarries and notice of such new marriage is timely received by the
Administrator.   
         -37-

If a Participant s Service Annuity is payable in the form of a marital annuity and if,
after the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Participant s Spouse predeceases the Participant or the Participant s Spouse, pursuant to a duly entered divorce decree, specifically relinquishes all rights to receive any Service
Annuity in the event of the Participant s death, the Participant s Service Annuity shall be recomputed prospectively as if the Participant were not married on the Annuity Starting Date. Any marriage by the Participant after the
Participant s Annuity Starting Date shall not affect the payment of the Participant s Service Annuity or require any payment to the Participant s new spouse.      If a Participant has elected to receive a family annuity and, either before or after payment of such annuity commences, all of the Participant s previously Dependent Minor Children have predeceased
the Participant or have ceased to be dependent, within the meaning of Section 152 of the Code, the Participant s election to receive a family annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or cessation
of being a dependent, be automatically cancelled.      If a Participant has elected to receive a surviving dependent s
annuity and either before or after payment of such annuity commences, all of the Participant s previously Dependent Disabled Children have predeceased the Participant or have ceased to be Dependent Disabled Children, as certified by the medical
director of the Company or by such other licensed physician designated by the Company, the Participant s election to receive a surviving dependent s annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or
cessation of being a Dependent Disabled Child, be automatically cancelled.      A Participant whose election has been
automatically cancelled pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be entitled to receive the Service Annuity described in Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment) or, in the case of an election that is automatically
cancelled prior to the Participant s Annuity Starting Date and subject to Section 6.1 (relating to the basic Service Annuity form of payment), such other form of Service Annuity described in Section 6.2 (relating to optional Service
Annuity forms) for which the Participant is eligible and elects in accordance with this Section 6.6.      G.  Lump Sum
Payment . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the monthly amount of any Service Annuity shall initially be or at any time become $10 or less,   
         -38-

the Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree may, in lieu of such annuity, elect to receive, and within 30 days after such election there shall be paid to such Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree, an
amount equal to the lump sum equivalent of such annuity calculated on the basis of the  applicable interest rate  as defined in Section 417 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder and the applicable mortality table.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of computing single sum payments on or after January 1, 2008, (i) the interest rate used shall be the interest rate as defined in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the second month
preceding the calendar year in which such distribution is made or commences and (ii) the mortality table shall be the mortality table specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the
Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs.      In the case of a distribution
pursuant to this Section 6.7 that is an  eligible rollover distribution  within the meaning of Section 402 of the Code and that is at least $200, an eligible distributee (as defined below) may elect that all or any portion of
such distribution shall be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from the Service Annuity Fund to (i) an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described
in Section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, (v) a retirement plan qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, (vi) an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code (the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover contributions) or
(vii) effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code; provided, however, that (x) with respect to a plan described in clause (vii), for transfers occurring before January 1, 2010, the Participant
(or surviving Spouse of a Participant or a former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code) meets the requirements of Section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the Code and
(y) with respect to a distribution (or portion of a distribution) to a person who is not the Participant or the surviving Spouse of the Participant,  eligible retirement plan  shall mean only a plan described
  
         -39-

in clause (i) or (ii) or effective January 1, 2010, clause (vii), that, in either case, is established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the term  Spouse  shall include the Participant s surviving Spouse and the Participant s Spouse or former Spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order. In
addition, in the case of a distribution that occurs on or after January 1, 2008, a Beneficiary who is not the Spouse of the Participant may elect that all or any portion of such distribution shall be directly transferred as a rollover
contribution from this Plan to (i) an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code or (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code that, in either case, is established for the
purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of the Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an eligible distributee shall not be entitled to elect to have less than the total amount of such distribution transferred as a rollover contribution
unless the amount to be transferred equals at least $500. At least 30 days but no more than 90 days prior to the date on which the eligible distributee is entitled to receive a distribution described in this Section 6.7, a written explanation
shall be provided to the eligible distributee of the availability of the direct rollover option, the rules that require income tax withholding on distributions, the rules under which the eligible distributee may roll over the distribution within 60
days of receipt and, if applicable, other special tax rules that may apply to the distribution.      For purposes of this
Section 6.7,  eligible distributee  shall include the Participant, his Spouse or his alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code and, effective January 1, 2008,
the Participant s Beneficiary who is not the Participant s Spouse.      H.  Distributions to Dependent Minor and
Disabled Children . Any distribution under this Plan to a Dependent Minor Child or Dependent Disabled Child, or payment to any person for the account of a Dependent Minor Child or Dependent Disabled Child, as the case may be, shall discharge all
obligations in respect of such payment, and none of the Company, the Trustee, the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary or the Corporate Investment Committee, shall have any duty to see to the application by any third party of any distribution
made to or for the benefit of such Dependent Minor Child or Dependent Disabled Child.   
         -40-

7.      LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS      A.  Maximum Annual Benefits . Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the amount of the Participant s annual benefit (as defined below) accrued, distributed or payable at any time under the Plan shall be limited to an amount such that such annual benefit and the
aggregate annual benefit of the Participant under all other defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer or any other Affiliate does not exceed the lesser of:   
  (i) $160,000 (as increased to reflect the cost of living adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the Code),
multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of participation (within the meaning of Section 1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii) of the Regulations) and the denominator of which is
10; or      (ii) an amount equal to 100% of the Participant s average compensation for the 3 consecutive
calendar years in which his or her compensation was the highest (as determined in accordance with Section 1.415(b)-1(a)(5) of the Regulations) and which are included in his or her years of service (within the meaning of
Section 1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii) of the Regulations) with the Employers multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of service with the Employers and the denominator of
which is 10.      The dollar amount set forth in clause (i) of the preceding paragraph shall be actuarially reduced in
accordance with Section 1.415(b)-1(d) of the Regulations if the Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs prior to the Participant s attainment of age 62. If the Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs after the
Participant s attainment of age 65, such dollar amount shall be actuarially increased in accordance with Section 1.415(b)-1(e) of the Regulations.      A Participant s  annual benefit  shall mean the Participant s accrued benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity, as determined in, and accordance with,
Section 1.415(b)-1(b) of the Regulations. If the annual benefit is payable in a form other than a single life annuity, the annual benefit shall be adjusted to the   
         -41-

actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity using the assumptions of the following sentences;  provided ,  however , that no adjustment shall be required for survivor benefits payable
to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as described in Section 6.1(b)) to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the Participant s annual benefit were paid in another form.   
  Effective for Plan Years beginning January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005, for any form of benefit subject to
Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greater of (i) the amount computed using the annual interest rate specified under section 417(e) of the Code for the November preceding the calendar year in
which such distribution is made or commences, and the mortality table prescribed for purposes of section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Code (the  Actuarial Equivalent ) and (ii) the amount computed using an interest rate assumption of
5.5% and the applicable mortality table under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Regulations (the  Applicable Mortality Table ). Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit subject to
Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greatest of (i) the amount computed using the Actuarial Equivalent under the Plan, (ii) the amount computed using an interest rate assumption of 5.5% and
the Applicable Mortality Table and (iii) the amount computed using the applicable interest rate under Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) of the Regulations and the Applicable Mortality Table, divided by 1.05. Effective for Plan Years beginning on or
after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.415(b)-1(c) of the Regulations. An individual s
 annual benefit  under any other defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer and Affiliate shall be as determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and the Regulations issued thereunder the terms of such plan.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the limitation provided by this Section shall not apply to a
Participant who has not at any time participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by any Employer and whose annual benefit under the Plan does not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th) the
numerator of which is the Participant s years of years of service (within the meaning of Section 1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii) of the Regulations) and the denominator of which is 10.   
  For purposes of this Section, the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in Section 415(c)(3) of the Code
and the applicable Regulations, the term  defined contribution plan  shall have the meaning   
         -42-

set forth in Section 1.415(c)-1(a)(2) of the Regulations, the term  defined benefit plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1.415(b)-1(a)(2) of the Regulations and
the term  Employer  shall include the Employers and all corporations and entities required to be aggregated with any of the Employers pursuant to Section 414(b) and (c) of the Code as modified by Section 415(h) of the Code.
     B.  Temporary Restrictions on Benefits in Case of Termination or Curtailment . This Section 7.2 sets forth
restrictions required by the Internal Revenue Service on the Service Annuity payable for a Plan Year to a highly compensated employee or highly compensated former employee, as described in Section 414(q) of the Code and Regulations who is among
the twenty-five highest paid nonexcludable employees in the service of the Employers for the Plan Year. The restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 shall not become applicable if:   
  after payment to such highly compensated employee of any Service Annuity, the value of Plan assets equals or exceeds 110
percent of the value of current liabilities (as defined in Section 412(l)(7) of the Code),      the value of
the Service Annuity paid to such highly compensated employee is less than one percent of the value of current liabilities of the Plan, or      the value of the Service Annuity payable to or on behalf of such highly compensated employee does not exceed the amount described in Section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code.   
  If the Service Annuity payable to a Participant is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2, the Service Annuity
provided from the Plan shall not exceed the payments that would be made on behalf of such Participant under a single life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the sum of the Participant s Service Annuity and the Participant s other
benefits under the Plan.      The foregoing conditions do not restrict the full payment of any death or survivor s benefits
on behalf of a Participant who dies while the Plan is in full effect and its full current costs have been met.      Any amounts
that become due but because of the limitations of this Section 7.2, if applicable, cannot be made available to or for the Participant (either currently or later) shall be applied to reduce subsequent contributions of the Employers; but if the
Employers have ceased contributions to the Plan, such amounts shall be applied for the benefit of Participants not affected by this Section 7.2 in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner.   
         -43-

This Section 7.2 is inserted solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Service and shall not be applied except to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements.      C.
 Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding . (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s  Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage  (the
 AFTAP ), as defined in Section 436(j) of the Code, is at or below the following levels.      If the
Plan s AFTAP is 60% or greater but less than 80% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment (as defined in subsection 7.3(a)(iv) below) after the valuation date for the Plan Year to the extent the amount of the payment
exceeds the lesser of (x) 50% of the amount of the payment which could be made without regard to the restrictions under this subsection 7.3 and (y) the present value (determined pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under Section 417(e) of the Code) of the maximum guarantee with respect to the Participant under Section 4022 of ERISA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, only one
such prohibited payment may be made with respect to any Participant during any period of consecutive Plan Years to which the limitations under either clause (x) or (y) of the preceding sentence apply. For purposes of this subsection
7.3(a)(i), a Participant, his Beneficiary and any alternate payee (as defined in Section 414(p)(8) of the Code) shall be deemed a single  Participant.    
  If the Plan s AFTAP is less than 60% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment after the
valuation date for the Plan Year.      During any period in which the Company is a debtor in a case under Title 11,
United States Code (or similar federal or state law), the Plan shall not make any prohibited payment. The preceding sentence shall not apply on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the AFTAP is not less than
100%.      For purposes of this subsection 7.3(a), the term  prohibited payment  means (x) any
payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any supplements described in Section 6.2), to a Participant or Beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in Section 417(f)(2) of the Code and any
regulations promulgated thereunder) occurs during any period a limitation under subsection 7.3(a)(ii) or (iii) is in effect, (y) any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or (z) any
other payment specified by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.      2. In any Plan Year in which the Plan s AFTAP
for such Plan Year is less than 60%, benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the valuation date for the Plan Year. This restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon
payment by the Company or the Employers of a contribution (in addition to any minimum required contribution under Section 430 of the Code) equal to the amount sufficient to result in an AFTAP of 60%.   
         -44-

3. No amendment which has the effect of increasing Plan liabilities by reason of increases
in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accruals or the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect during any Plan Year if the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 80% or would be
less than 80% after taking into account such amendment; provided, however, that the preceding restriction shall not apply to an amendment which provides for an increase in benefits under a formula which is not based on a Participant s
compensation if the rate of such increase is not in excess of the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of Participants covered by the amendment; and provided, further, that such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan
Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment), upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a contribution as described in Section 436(c)(2) of the Code.   
  4. The Plan shall not provide an unpredictable contingent event benefit payable with respect to any event occurring during any Plan Year
if the AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60% or would be less than 60% after taking into account such occurrence; provided, however, such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan
Year, upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a contribution as described in Section 436(b)(2) of the Code. For purposes of this subsection 7.3(d), the term  unpredictable contingent event benefit  means any benefit payable
solely by reason of a plant shutdown (or similar event, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), or any event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or occurrence of death
or disability.      5. To avoid benefit restrictions, the Company may take any action permitted by Section 436 of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.      6. The provisions of this subsection 7.3 are intended to comply with
Section 436 of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall be construed to comply therewith.      8.
     SERVICE ANNUITY FUND      The Service Annuity Fund is the Service Annuity Fund created by the Company for the payment of Service Annuities. All contributions under this Plan shall be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall hold all
monies and other property received by it and shall invest and   
         -45-

reinvest the same, together with the income therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the directions of the Investment Fiduciary. The Investment Fiduciary shall be
a  named fiduciary  under the Plan for purposes of ERISA and, as such, may, in its discretion, delegate to one or more investment managers, as defined in ERISA, the authority to hold, manage, acquire and dispose of all or any part of the
Service Annuity Fund. Any investment manager appointed by the Investment Fiduciary pursuant to this Article 8 which is a bank or trust company supervised by a State or Federal agency is authorized and empowered to invest and reinvest all or any part
of the Service Annuity Fund allocated to it for investment in any common, collective or commingled trust qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) and exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code which is maintained by such
investment manager ( common trust ). During such period of time as all or any portion of the Service Annuity Fund shall be invested in a common trust, the trust document governing such common trust shall govern any investment therein and
such trust document shall be a part hereof. Investment of the common trust in deposits of the trustee of the common trust is hereby expressly authorized.   
         -46-

In addition, the Investment Fiduciary is authorized and empowered to direct the Trustee as
to the investment and reinvestment all or any part of the Service Annuity Fund in the Commonwealth Edison Pooled Fund (the  Pooled Fund ). During such period of time as all or any portion of the Service Annuity Fund is invested in the
Pooled Fund, the trust document governing the Pooled Fund shall govern any investment therein and such trust document shall be a part hereof. On and after November 1, 2010, the Service Annuity Fund shall be invested in the Exelon Corporation
Pension Master Retirement Trust (the  Master Trust ), which is an amendment and restatement of the Pooled Fund, and the Master Trust document shall govern any investment therein. The Investment Fiduciary may delegate to one or more
investment managers, as defined in ERISA, the authority to hold, manage, acquire and dispose of all or any part of the Service Annuity Fund invested in the Pooled Fund or, on and after November 1, 2010, in the Master Trust.   
  The Trustee shall make distributions from the Service Annuity Fund at such time or times to such person or persons and in such amounts as
the Administrator shall direct in accordance with this Plan.      9.   
  SPECIAL RULES RELATING TO PARTICIPATION OF AND DISTRIBUTION TO CERTAIN TERMINATED   
  OR TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES      A.  Employment After Commencement of Service Annuity . A retired Employee or former Employee, other than an Employee described in either of the following paragraphs, receiving, or eligible to begin
receiving, a Service Annuity may be employed in any business, including that of an Employer or an Affiliate, without in any way affecting the payment to him or her of his or her Service Annuity, provided however, that if he or she is employed by an
  
         -47-

Employer or an Affiliate, such employment satisfies the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits as set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring
of retirees.      A retired bargaining unit Employee or former bargaining unit Employee, if such bargaining unit Employee was a
member of Local Union 15 (or a predecessor union), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, receiving a Service Annuity may be employed in any business, other than that of the Company, without in any way affecting the payment to him or her
of his or her Service Annuity. Such retired bargaining unit Employee, or former bargaining unit Employee, receiving a Service Annuity may be employed in the temporary service of an Employer or an Affiliate, but, except as otherwise provided in
paragraph (b) of Section 5.2, during the term of such employment, he or she shall not receive any Service Annuity payments unless such employment is for less than 40 Hours of Service per calendar month. Upon the conclusion of such
temporary service employment, Service Annuity payments shall again be made to him or her, as described in Section 9.4 (relating to suspension of Service Annuities).

Retirement Age without having any Termination of Employment that results in the Participant beginning to receive his or her Service Annuity shall not be entitled to receive any Service Annuity for any calendar month of employment by an Employer or
an Affiliate during which the Participant completes at least 40 Hours of Service. If the Service Annuity payments of a Participant described in the preceding sentence or a Participant described in either of the second or third paragraph of
Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity System) are suspended, then such payments shall resume at the earlier of (i) such Participant s actual retirement, or (ii) such Participant s ceasing

or Service Annuity nor shall any Service Annuity payment be made with respect to any month during which his or her Service Annuity was suspended pursuant to this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of
Service Annuity System).

notice will contain such information as may from time to time be required by Section 2530.203-3(b)(4) of the regulations of the Department of Labor or any amendment thereto.   
  3. If a Participant erroneously receives Service Annuity payments for a month during which such payments should have been suspended
pursuant to this Section 9.4 or Section 9.1 (relating to employment after commencement of Service Annuity System), then the Administrator may deduct from future Service Annuity payments such erroneously received payments. However, no such
deduction may exceed in any one month 25 percent of that month s payment to which the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary, as the case may be, would have been entitled.

delivered or transmitted to a Participant or any other person entitled to or claiming benefits under this Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given, made or transmitted when mailed by first class mail with postage prepaid and addressed to the
Participant or such other person at the address last appearing on the records of the Administrator.      H.  Notices to
Employers or Administrator . Written directions, notices and other communications from Participants or any other person entitled to or claiming benefits under this Plan to the Employers or Administrator shall be deemed to have been duly given,
made or transmitted either when delivered to such location as shall be specified upon the forms prescribed by the Administrator for the giving of such directions, notices and other communications or
  
         -64-

when mailed by first class mail with postage prepaid and addressed to the addressee at the address specified upon such forms.   
  I.  Records . Each of the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary and the Corporate Investment Committee shall keep a record of all
of their respective proceedings, if any, and shall keep or cause to be kept all books of account records and other data as may be necessary or advisable in their respective judgment for the administration of the Plan, the administration of the
investments of the Plan or the monitoring of the investment activities of the Plan, as applicable.      J.  Responsibility to
Advise Administrator of Current Address . Each person entitled to receive a payment under this Plan shall file with the Administrator in writing such person s complete mailing address and each change therein. A check or communication mailed
to any person at such person s address on file with the Administrator shall be deemed to have been received by such person for all purposes of this Plan. Although neither the Administrator nor the Trustee shall be obliged to search for or
ascertain the location of any person, the Administrator shall make reasonable efforts to locate any missing Participant or Beneficiary entitled to benefits hereunder. If the Administrator is in doubt as to whether payments are being received by the
person entitled thereto, it shall, by registered mail addressed to the person concerned at his or her last address known to the Administrator, notify such person that all future payments will be withheld until such person submits to the
Administrator evidence of his or her continued life and proper mailing address.      K.  Electronic Media . Notwithstanding
any provision of the Plan to the contrary and for all purposes of the Plan, to the extent permitted by the Administrator and any   
         -65-

applicable law or Regulation, the use of electronic technologies shall be deemed to satisfy any written notice, consent, delivery, signature, disclosure or recordkeeping requirement under the
Plan, the Code or ERISA to the extent permitted by or consistent with applicable law and Regulations. Any transmittal by electronic technology shall be deemed delivered when successfully sent to the recipient, or such other time specified by the
Administrator.      L.  Correction of Error . If it comes to the attention of the Administrator that an error has been made
in the amount of benefits payable, or paid, to any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, the Administrator shall be permitted to correct such error by whatever means that the Administrator, in its sole discretion determines, including by
offsetting future benefits payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or requiring repayment of benefits to the Plan, except that no adjustment need be made with respect to any Participant or Beneficiary whose benefit has been distributed in full
prior to the discovery of such error.      11.      PARTICIPATION BY OTHER EMPLOYERS      A.  Adoption of Plan . With the consent of
the Company, any entity may become a participating Employer under this Plan with respect to all or a designated group of its employees by taking such action as shall be necessary or desirable to adopt this Plan and executing and delivering such
instruments as may be necessary or desirable to put this Plan into effect with respect to such entity.      B.  Withdrawal from
Participation . Any Employer shall terminate its participation in the Plan at any time, under such circumstances as the Company may provide, by delivering to the Company a duly certified copy of a resolution of its board of directors (or other
  
         -66-

governing body) to that effect, or by ceasing to be a member of the same controlled group as the Company (within the meaning of section 1563(a) if the Code).   
  C.  Company and Administrator Agent for Employers . Each corporation which shall become a participating Employer pursuant to
Section 11.1 (relating to adoption of the Plan) or Article 12 (relating to continuance by a successor) by so doing shall be deemed to have appointed the Company and the Administrator its agent to exercise on its behalf all of the powers and
authorities hereby conferred upon the Company and the Administrator by the terms of this Plan, including, but not by way of limitation, the power to amend and terminate this Plan. The authority of the Company and the Administrator to act as such
agent shall continue unless and until the portion of the Service Annuity Fund held for the benefit of Employees of the particular Employer and their Beneficiaries is set aside in a separate trust as provided in Section 15.2 (relating to
establishment of separate plan).      12.      CONTINUANCE BY A SUCCESSOR      In the event that any Employer shall be reorganized
by way of merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or otherwise, so that a corporation, partnership or person other than an Employer shall succeed to all or substantially all of such Employer s business, such successor may be substituted for
such Employer under this Plan by adopting this Plan and, if necessary, becoming a party to the Service Annuity Fund. Contributions by such Employer shall be automatically suspended from the effective date of any such reorganization until the date
upon which the substitution of such successor corporation for the Employer under this Plan becomes effective. If, within 90 days following the effective date of any such reorganization, such successor shall not have elected to become a party to this
Plan, or if such successor shall adopt a plan of complete liquidation other than in connection with a reorganization, this Plan shall be automatically terminated with respect to employees of such Employer as of the close of business on the 90th day
following the effective date of such reorganization or as of the close of business on the date of adoption of such plan of complete liquidation, as the case may be, and the Administrator shall direct the
  
         -67-

Trustee to distribute the portion of the Service Annuity Fund applicable to such Employer in the manner provided in Section 15.2 (relating to establishment of separate plan).   
  13.   
  MISCELLANEOUS   
  A.  Expenses . The expenses of the Trustee in the administration of the Service Annuity Fund, including compensation, if any, to the
Trustee for its services, shall be paid by the Company or the Employers. All costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Service Annuity Fund, to the extent not described in the preceding sentence, and all costs and expenses incurred in the
operation of the Plan, the Service Annuity Fund, the Pooled Fund or the Master Trust, as applicable, including, but not limited to,  direct expenses  incurred in administering the Plan, the Service Annuity Fund, the Pooled Fund and the
Master Trust (including compensation paid to any employee of an Employer or an Affiliate who is engaged in the administration of the Plan, the Service Annuity Fund, the Pooled Fund or the Master Trust), the expenses of the Administrator, the
Investment Fiduciary and the Corporate Investment Committee, the fees of counsel and any agents for the Trustee, the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary or the Corporate Investment Committee, and the fees of investment managers that manage
assets of the Pooled Fund or the Master Trust, as applicable, shall be paid by the Trustee from the Service Annuity Fund or the Pooled Fund or the Master Trust, as applicable, in such proportion as the Investment Fiduciary, in its sole discretion,
shall determine, to the extent such expenses are not paid by the Employers and to the extent permitted under ERISA, Regulations and other applicable laws. Any such expenses that are borne by the Employers shall be paid out of their own funds in such
proportions as the Administrator shall determine. In the event that the Company or any other Employer advances money on behalf of the Service Annuity Fund for the payment of any expenses incurred in the operation of the Plan, the Trustee shall
reimburse the   
         -68-

Company or such other Employer from the Service Annuity Fund for any amount so advanced, without interest or fees.      B.  Non-Assignability . 1. It is a condition of this Plan, and all rights of each Participant, Beneficiary and Retiree shall be subject thereto, that no right or interest of any Participant,
Beneficiary or Retiree in this Plan shall be assignable or transferable in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, but not by way of limitation, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge or
bankruptcy, but excluding devolution by death or mental incompetency, and no right or interest of any Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree in this Plan shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of such Participant, Beneficiary
or Retiree, including claims for alimony or the support of any spouse or child, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 13.2 (relating to exception for qualified domestic relations orders).   
  2.  Exception for Qualified Domestic Relations Orders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if a
Participant s Service Annuity under this Plan, or any portion thereof, shall be the subject of one or more qualified domestic relations orders, as defined below, such Service Annuity or portion thereof shall be paid to the person at the time
and in the manner specified in any such order. For purposes of this paragraph (b),  qualified domestic relations order  shall mean any  domestic relations order  as defined in Section 10.3 (relating to procedures for
domestic relations orders) which creates (or recognizes the existence of) or assigns to a person other than the Participant (an  alternate payee ) rights to all or a portion of the Participant s Service Annuity under this Plan, and:
     clearly specifies      the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the Participant and each alternate payee covered by such order,      the amount or percentage of the Participant s Service Annuity to be paid by this Plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,   
         -69-

the number of payments to, or period of time for which, such order applies,
and      each plan to which such order applies;   
  does not require      this Plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided under this Plan at the time such order is issued,   
  this Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial equivalence), or   
  the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which at the time such order is issued already are required to be paid to a
different alternate payee under a prior qualified domestic relations order; and      does not require the payment
of benefits to any alternate payee before the first to occur of (i) the earliest date as of which payment of the Participant s Service Annuity could commence after his or her Termination of Employment, and (ii) the Participant s
attainment of age 50,      all as determined by the Company pursuant to the procedures contained in Section 10.3 (relating to procedures for
domestic relations orders). Any amounts subject to a domestic relations order prior to determination of its status as a qualified domestic relations order which but for such order would be paid to the Participant shall be segregated in a separate
account or an escrow account pending such determination. If, within a reasonable time after receipt of written evidence of such order by the Company, it is determined that a domestic relations order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order,
the amount so segregated (plus any interest thereon) shall be paid to the alternate payee in accordance with the terms of the order. If, within a reasonable time after receipt of a domestic relations order by the Company, it is determined that a
domestic relations order does not constitute a qualified domestic relations order, then the amount so segregated (plus any interest thereon) shall, as soon as practicable, be paid to the Participant. Any subsequent determination that such order
constitutes a qualified domestic relations order shall apply only to payments made on or after the date of such subsequent determination.      C.  Employment Non-Contractual . Neither this Plan nor any action taken by the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary confers any right upon any Employee to continue in employment with any
Employer.      D.  Limitation of Rights . No Participant, Beneficiary or Retiree shall have any right, title, interest or
claim in or to any part of the Service Annuity Fund at any time, but shall   
         -70-

have the right only to distributions from the Service Annuity Fund on the terms and conditions herein provided. Neither this Plan nor any action taken by the Administrator or the Investment
Fiduciary shall obligate any Employer to make contributions to the Service Annuity Fund in excess of the contributions authorized by the board of directors of the Company or create any liability on an Employer for the payment of Service Annuities
under this Plan.      E.  Merger or Consolidation with or Transfer to Another Plan . A merger or consolidation with, or
transfer of assets or liabilities to, any other Plan shall not be effected unless the terms of such merger, consolidation or transfer are such that each Participant, Beneficiary, Retiree or other person entitled to receive benefits from this Plan
would, if this Plan were to terminate immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer, receive a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit such person would be entitled to receive if this Plan were to terminate immediately before the
merger, consolidation, or transfer.      If an Employee or a group of Employees ceases to be an Employee or Employees of an
Employer and becomes an employee or employees of an Affiliate that is not an Employer but that maintains its own pension plan, there shall be transferred from the Service Annuity Fund to the trust fund for the pension plan of such Affiliate assets
in an amount equal to the proportion of the amount of the total assets of the Service Annuity Fund, after deducting therefrom the amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to all
Retirees and Participants, which the actuarial reserve allocable to such Employee or such group of Employees, as the case may be, bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all Employees. If, however, any such group of Employees shall include all
of the Employees of all Employers, all of the assets of the Service Annuity Fund shall be so transferred.      If and when a
separate pension plan and trust fund is created by the Company for supervisory, administrative and management Employees, there shall be transferred from the Service Annuity Fund to such separate trust fund assets in an amount equal to the sum of
(a) that proportion of the amount of the total assets of the   
         -71-

Service Annuity Fund, after deducting therefrom the amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to all Retirees and
Participants, which the actuarial reserve allocable to such supervisory, administrative and management Employees bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all Employees, and (b) the amount of assets actuarially determined to be necessary for
the payment in full of Service Annuities theretofore granted to Retirees who were supervisory, administrative or management Employees at the time of the granting of such Service Annuities. If and when an Employee shall thereafter be transferred to
or from the management payroll, there shall be transferred from the Service Annuity Fund to such separate trust fund or from such separate trust fund to the Service Annuity Fund, as the case may be, assets in an amount determined in the same manner
as described in the preceding sentence (and the Employee s Service Annuity or benefits in the nature of a service annuity shall subsequently be paid out of the Service Annuity Fund or such separate trust fund, as the case may be).   
  If and when an employee or a group of employees of an Affiliate that is not an Employer shall cease to be an employee or employees of
such Affiliate and shall become an Employee or Employees of an Employer, the Trustee under the Service Annuity Fund shall accept, upon transfer from the trust fund of the pension plan of such Affiliate, assets in an amount equivalent to that
proportion of the amount of the total assets of such trust fund, after deducting therefrom the amount actuarially determined to be necessary for the payment in full of benefits theretofore granted, which the actuarial reserve allocable to such
Employee or such groups of Employees, as the case may be, bears to the actuarial reserve allocable to all employees. If, however, any such group of Employees shall include all of the employees of such Affiliate, all of the assets of such trust fund
shall be so accepted.      In the case of each transfer of assets made or accepted pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 13.5, the amount of the total assets and (if less than all assets are to be transferred) the proportion thereof to be transferred shall be determined as of a date not earlier than December 31 of the preceding calendar year.
     All assets accepted, upon transfer, by the Trustee under the Service Annuity Fund, pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 13.5, shall be held and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement relating to the Service Annuity Fund.   
         -72-

F.  Medical Examination . A Participant or Beneficiary for whom a determination or
verification of physical or medical condition is in the opinion of the Administrator relevant to the application of this Plan shall, if and when reasonably requested by the Administrator, submit to medical examination by a physician appointed by the
Administrator.      G.  Applicable Law . Except to the extent preempted by applicable federal law or otherwise provided under
the terms of the Plan, the Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.      H.  Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan . Except for actions to which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413 of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action
relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant receives a final decision from the Chief Human Resources Officer (or such other officer designated from time to time by the
Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the
person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from
recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal or equitable action against any party.      I.  Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan . Any legal action involving the Plan that is brought by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the
  
         -73-

federal courts located in the Northern District of Illinois or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whichever is most convenient, and no other federal or state court.   
  J.  Legal Fees . Any award of legal fees in connection with an action involving the Plan shall be calculated pursuant to a method
that results in the lowest amount of fees being paid, which amount shall be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to (a) administrative proceedings under the Plan,
(b) unsuccessful claims brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or (c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be no enhancement for the risk of contingency,
nonpayment or any other risk nor shall there be applied a contingency multiplier or any other multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary, the
Corporate Investment Committee, any Plan fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, any Plan administrator, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan Parties ), legal fees of
the Plan Parties in connection with such action shall be paid by the Participant, Beneficiary or other person bringing the action, unless the court specifically finds that there was a reasonable basis for the action.   
  14.      TOP-HEAVY
PLAN REQUIREMENTS      A.  Top-Heavy Plan Determination . If, as of the determination date (as hereinafter defined) for any
Plan Year, the aggregate present value of (a) the accrued Service Annuities under this Plan and the accrued benefits under all other defined benefit plans in the aggregation group (as defined below) and (b) the aggregate account balances
under all defined contribution plans in such aggregation group, in each case with respect to all participants in such   
         -74-

plans who are key employees (as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code) for such Plan Year, exceeds 60% of the aggregate of the present value of the Service Annuities, accrued benefits and
account balances of all participants in such plans as of the determination date, then this Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year, and the requirements of Section 14.2 (relating to minimum benefit for top-heavy years),
Section 14.3 (relating to top-heavy vesting requirements) and Section 14.4 (relating to special rules for applying statutory limitations on benefits) shall be applicable for such Plan Year as of the first day thereof. An employee s
compensation, as defined in Section 1.415(c)-2 of the Regulations, from the Company and its Affiliates for a Plan Year shall be used, where applicable, in determining whether such employee is a key employee.   
  For purposes of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph, for any Plan Year, the Service Annuity accrued in respect of any Employee
shall be the amount calculated as of the determination date, and the present value of such amount shall be based on the actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial valuation as of such determination date. The calculation of the present value of the
Service Annuity accrued in respect of any Employee shall be subject to adjustments required under Section 416 of the Code.   
  If this Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for any Plan Year and not be a top-heavy plan for any subsequent Plan Year, the requirements of
this Article shall not be applicable for such subsequent Plan Year except to the extent provided in Section 14.3 (relating to top-heavy vesting requirements).      For purposes of this Article, (a) the aggregation group shall consist of (i) if a key employee was a Participant in this Plan during the Plan Year containing the determination date (defined
below) or any of the four preceding Plan Years, then this Plan and each other plan of an Employer which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and in which a key employee is a participant during any of such Plan Years, (ii) this
Plan and each other plan which enables this Plan to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or 410(b) of the Code during the Plan Year containing the determination date (defined below) or any of the four preceding Plan Years, and
(iii) this Plan and each other plan of an Employer which it shall so designate and which together with this Plan shall satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code; (b) the determination date for all plans in the
aggregation   
         -75-

group shall be the last day of the preceding plan year; and (c) the valuation date applicable to a determination date shall be (i) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the date as of
which the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan year including the determination date is prepared, and (ii) in the case of a defined contribution plan, the date as of which account balances are determined which is coincident with or
immediately precedes the determination date, except that if any such plan specifies a different determination or valuation date, such different date shall be used with respect to such plan. For the purpose of determining the Service Annuity, accrued
benefit or account balance of a participant, any person who received a distribution from a plan in the aggregation group during the one-year period ending on the last day of the preceding plan year shall be treated as a participant in such plan, and
any such distribution shall be included in such participant s Service Annuity, accrued benefit or account balance as the case may be, except that in the case of any distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death or
disability, this sentence shall be applied by substituting  five-year period  for the  one-year period  stated herein.      B.  Minimum Benefit for Top-Heavy Years . 1. Subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 14.2 and the applicable reductions set forth in Article 5 (relating to Service Annuities) and Article 6
(relating to Service Annuity forms), the annual amount of Service Annuity on a single life basis to which an eligible employee (other than an eligible employee who is a key employee as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code) is entitled at age
65 under Section 5.2 (relating to normal and deferred retirement), Section 5.3 (relating to early retirement), Section 5.4 (relating to disability retirement at or after age 45), Section 5.5 (relating to disability retirement
before age 45) or Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested termination) shall in no event be less than (i) the product of (A) 2% of such eligible employee s average compensation, as described in Section 416(c) of the Code,
from the Company and its Affiliates during such eligible employee s five highest-paid consecutive calendar years of service beginning after January 1, 1983 and while the Plan is top-heavy, multiplied by (B) the number of such eligible
employee s years of Credited Service (but not in excess of ten) ending after December 31, 1983 while the Plan is top-heavy less (ii) the annual actuarial equivalent of the eligible employee s
  
         -76-

vested portion of such eligible employee s account balances attributable to employer contributions and forfeitures, and earnings and losses thereon (including prior distributions thereof)
and accrued benefits to which such eligible employee is entitled on Termination of Employment under all other qualified plans maintained by the Company or its Affiliates.      For purposes of this Article 14 (relating to top-heavy plan requirements),  eligible employee  shall mean any employee other than an employee who is included in a unit of employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and an Employer, if there is evidence that retirement benefits have been the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such Employer.   
  2. The provisions of paragraph (a) shall not apply with respect to an eligible employee if, for each year in which this Plan is
top-heavy, (i) the eligible employee s Employer also maintains a defined contribution plan which is included in the aggregation group for such year, and (ii) contributions made on behalf of each eligible employee other than key
employees and forfeitures allocated to such eligible employee during such Plan Year are at least 5% of such eligible employee s compensation.      C.  Top-Heavy Vesting Requirements . Not-withstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if an eligible employee s Termination of Employment occurs during a Plan Year in which this Plan
is top-heavy and after the eligible employee has completed at least two years of Vesting Service but before the eligible employee has completed five years of Vesting Service, or after this Plan has been top-heavy and during the time this Plan was
top-heavy such eligible employee has completed three years of Vesting Service, then such eligible employee shall be entitled, subject to Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms) and Article 7 (relating to limitation on benefits), to
receive, determined in accordance with the following table, the vested percentage of the eligible employee s Service Annuity computed pursuant to Section 5.7 (relating to deferred vested termination):   
         -77-

D.  Special Rules for
Applying Statutory Limitations on Benefits . In any Plan Year for which this Plan is top-heavy, clauses (C)(I) and (D)(I) of the first paragraph of Section 7.1 (relating to maximum annual benefits) shall be applied by substituting
 100%  for  125%  appearing therein unless, for such Plan Year (i) the percentage of Service Annuities accrued by Participants who are key employees does not exceed 90% of the Service Annuities accrued by all Participants,
and (ii) the minimum accrued benefit of each Participant under all defined benefit plans in the aggregation group is at least 3% of such Participant s average compensation multiplied by each year of such Participant s Credited Service
after 1983, not in excess of 10, while such plans are top-heavy.      15.   
  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION      A.  Amendment . The board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) may at any time and from time to time amend or modify this Plan in any manner deemed by the board of directors of the
Company to be necessary or desirable, provided, however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of
the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or
another executive officer holding title of   
         -78-

equivalent or greater responsibility and, provided, further, that no amendment shall be made that affects Employees who are represented by IBEW Local Union 15 that is not consistent with that
portion of the Company s collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan. Any such amendment or modification shall become effective on such date as the board of directors of the Company shall determine and may
apply to Participants in this Plan at the time thereof as well as to future Participants, provided, however, that no such amendment or modification which reduces the basis for the computation of Service Annuities shall be retroactive as to service
prior to the date of such amendment or modification.      In addition, the Administrator may amend or modify subdivision
(4) of Section 2.1 (relating to the definition of Basic Compensation) and subdivision (23) of Section 2.1 (relating to the definition of Incentive Pay) by changing such subdivisions as described therein.   
  B.  Establishment of Separate Plan . If an Employer shall withdraw from this Plan under Section 11.2 (relating to withdrawal
from participation), the Investment Fiduciary shall determine the portion of the Service Annuity Fund held by the Trustee which is applicable to the Participants and Retirees of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate such portion in a
separate trust. Such separate trust shall thereafter be held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.   
  C.  Termination of the Plan by an Employer . The Company may at any time, by resolution adopted by its board of directors, terminate
this Plan in its entirety. In addition, any Employer may at any time terminate its participation in this Plan by resolution adopted by its board of directors to that effect. If the Internal Revenue Service shall refuse to issue an initial favorable
determination letter that this Plan and the Service Annuity Fund as adopted by the Company meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the Service Annuity   
         -79-

Fund is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, any Employer may terminate its participation in this Plan and direct the Trustee to pay and deliver to that Employer the portion of
the Service Annuity Fund applicable to its contributions.      D.  Distribution upon Termination or Partial Termination .
Upon termination or partial termination of this Plan, the Service Annuities accrued as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case may be, of all affected Participants shall be fully vested. After providing for any expenses of the
termination of this Plan, or, in the event of the partial termination of this Plan, any expenses of such partial termination which are to be borne by the portion of the Service Annuity Fund applicable to those Employees affected by the partial
termination, the remainder of such portion of the Service Annuity Fund (the  asset value ) shall be allocated pursuant to the priority categories set forth in Section 4044 of ERISA and PBGC Regulations. In the event that after the
termination of this Plan there is any asset value remaining after such allocation, the assets representing such asset value shall be paid over and applied for the benefit of the Employees of the Employers. The portion of the asset value allocated to
provide Service Annuities to any person or group of persons may be applied for the benefit of such person or persons by the distribution of cash, continuance of the Service Annuity Fund, establishment of a new trust fund, purchase of annuities from
an insurance company, or otherwise, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if the Plan is terminated, the Service Annuity of each highly compensated employee as defined in Section 414(q) of
the Code (and any former highly compensated employee) is limited to a Service Annuity that is nondiscriminatory under Section 401(a)(4) of the Code.      E.  Trust to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their Beneficiaries . Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.2 (relating to return of contributions), Section 15.3 (relating to
  
         -80-

termination of the Plan by an Employer), Section 15.4 (relating to distribution upon termination or partial termination of the Plan) and any other provision of this Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Service Annuity Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries either by operation or termination of this Plan, power
of amendment or other means.

  2.8 Pension Choice Election.      (a) In General. Each Participant who is, as of January 1, 2002, an Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (i) continue
participating in the Plan on and after January 1, 2002 or (ii) cease participating in the Plan as of December 31, 2001 and begin participating in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan as of January 1, 2002. Each
Eligible Employee who elects to continue participating in the Plan or who is offered and fails to make any such election shall continue to be a Participant as of January 1, 2002. Each Eligible Employee who elects to participate in the Exelon
Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan in lieu of participation in this Plan shall cease participation in the Plan as of December 31, 2001 and shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Plan, unless such Participant receives a notification
(the  Notice ) from the Company that his employment   
         11   

with the Company and the Affiliates will be terminated on or before December 31, 2002 and that such Participant is eligible for benefits under Article IVE of the Plan or any severance plan

participate in the Plan as of December 31, 2000, (ii) ceases to be a Power Team Employee as of January 1, 2004 because such Eligible Employee is no longer eligible to participate in the performance share award program for Power Team
employees under the Exelon Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan and (iii) did not previously make a valid election pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Committee, to either

  (b) Transfer of Benefits and Assets to Cash Balance Pension Plan. If an Eligible Employee described in paragraph
(a) above elects to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan in lieu of participating in the Plan, the Employee s pension, determined as of December 31, 2001, or December 31, 2003, as the case may be, based
on the Employee s Benefit Years, Compensation and average annual base salary as of such date, shall be transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan, and such Employee shall not accrue any additional benefit under the Plan. An
amount of assets that is equal to the present value of the Participant s pension described in the preceding sentence, determined using the methods and assumptions prescribed by Section 4044 of ERISA, shall also be transferred to the Exelon
Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan. Such transfer of benefits and assets related thereto shall occur as soon as administratively practicable after the Eligible Employee makes the election described in paragraph (a) above. In the event that
an Eligible Employee whose pension and related assets are transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan receives a Notice and has a Separation from Service on or before December 31, 2002, the pension and related assets that
were transferred to the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan shall be transferred back to the Plan and the amount of the pension benefit accrued by such Employee during 2002 (if any) shall be determined under the terms of this Plan rather
than the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan. Such transfer shall occur as soon as administratively practicable.      2.9
Cessation of Participation. An individual s participation in the Plan shall cease upon the first to occur of (i) the date the individual is no longer eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan or (ii) the individual s

         12   

2.10 Rehire of Employees. The following rules shall apply to an Eligible Employee who is
rehired by the Company after a Separation from Service and prior to commencing his pension or any benefits under the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan, as applicable:   
  (a) Rehire Date Before Absence of 5 Consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service. If an Employee terminates employment and is
later rehired by the Company before having an absence from employment with the Company and the Affiliates of five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, then either: (1) if such Employee was a Participant on the date his employment terminated,
such Employee shall be a Participant in the Plan as of his rehire date if he is then an Eligible Employee, or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and
shall not become a Participant. Notwithstanding clause (1) of the preceding sentence, if an Eligible Employee described in the preceding sentence was not at any time permitted to make the election described in Section 2.8(a) or was
permitted to make such election and elected to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan but such election was not given effect as a result of such Employee s Separation from Service, such Eligible Employee shall be
permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his rehire date or (2) participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan at the time prescribed therein
and have his pension and related assets transferred to such plan in the manner described in Section 2.8(b).   
  (b) Rehire Date After Absence of at Least 5 Consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service. If an Employee terminates employment
with the Company and the Affiliates and the Employee was not a Participant or was a Participant who did not have a vested pension as of the date his employment terminated, and such Employee is rehired by the Company after having an absence from
employment with the Company and the Affiliates of at least five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant upon such rehire. If a Participant with a vested pension
terminates employment with the Company and the Affiliates and the Participant is rehired after having an absence from employment with the Company and the Affiliates of at least five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, such Participant shall
remain a Participant upon his rehire. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if a Participant described in the preceding sentence was not at any time permitted to make the election described in Section 2.8(a), or was permitted to make such
election and elected to participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan but such election was not given effect as a result of such Employee s Separation from Service, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the
time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his rehire date or (2) participate in the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan at the time prescribed therein and have his pension and
related assets transferred to such plan in the manner described in Section 2.8(b).      (c) Circumstances
Permitting Commencement of Pension. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a Participant terminates employment and is reemployed as an Employee under circumstances that satisfy the
  
         13   

applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring or retirees, such Participant may elect to commence his
pension during such period of reemployment if he is otherwise eligible to commence such pension.      2.11 Change in Employment
Status or Transfer to Affiliate. Except as otherwise provided herein, if an Employee who was a Participant transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated
employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in the Plan but are instead either eligible to participate in another plan maintained by such Employer or Affiliate or are not eligible to participate in any plan, then such
individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment participate in the plan, if any, determined pursuant to rules established by the Company, which rules may be set forth in a Supplement hereto.   

ARTICLE III  
  Accrual of Benefits.        3.1
Accrued Benefit. Except as otherwise provided in this Article or in Article VI, each Participant shall have an Accrued Benefit equal to one-twelfth of the greater of:   
  (a) The sum of (1) 2% of his average annual Compensation during the period of his service, if any, between
January 1, 1930 and December 31, 1938, inclusive, multiplied by his Benefit Years before January 1, 1939, and (2) 2% of his aggregate Compensation for employment as an Eligible Employee after December 31, 1938, or
     (b) The sum of (1) a percentage of his average annual base salary plus, after December 31, 2001,
amounts earned (whether paid in the current or subsequent period) under the Exelon Corporation Annual Incentive Award Program for Management Employees, and the Exelon Corporation Quarterly Incentive Award Program (but excluding amounts earned under
any other business or group incentive or bonus programs) during his 60 consecutive months of employment with the Company that yield the highest twelve month average equal to 5% plus 1.2% for each of his first forty Benefit Years, and (2) 0.35%
of such highest average in excess of Covered Compensation as of the date of reference, multiplied by his Benefit Years (up to a maximum of 14%). (For the purposes of this Paragraph (b), (A) employment during the most recent 5 years shall
include absences which are included in Employment, except an absence prior to June 1, 1992 during which an Employee receives benefits under the Company s Disabilitant Plan, and the average annual base salary of an Employee on an included
absence shall be calculated as if his base salary continued during any period of such absence for which he did not receive compensation, such salary to be that in effect when such period began, adjusted for increases applicable to his job
classification which occur prior to the end of such period, (B) with respect to a Participant who is employed by the Company for less than 60-consecutive months, the Participant s average annual base salary shall be determined by averaging
the Participant s annual base salary for each calendar year in which the Participant was at any time an Employee, determined as if the Participant had remained an Employee for the entire year, provided, that, if there are more than 5 such
calendar years, the 5 years which result in the highest average will be used, (C) for purposes of determining consecutive months of employment, months in which the   
         14   

Participant performs no services, other than months for which salary is imputed under (A) above, shall be disregarded, (D) annual base salary shall be determined prior to reduction by
amounts contributed at the direction of the Employee to the PECO Energy Company Employee Savings Plan, the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan, the PECO Energy Company Employees  Section 125 Plan, the Exelon Corporation Benefits
Contributions Options, the Exelon Corporation Flexible Benefits Program, or for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, amounts contributed to a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan under Section 132(f)(4) of the Code,
(E) effective January 1, 1990, a Participant s annual base salary shall not include any lump sum payment of his accrued vacation pay or sick pay, nor any severance payment made by the Company or an Affiliate or pursuant to any plan
maintained by the Company or any Affiliate), (F) effective January 1, 1996 for purposes of calculating average annual base salary, any raise received during the month shall be deemed to have been received on the first of such month and
(G) amounts earned under the Exelon Corporation Annual Incentive Award Program for Management Employees and the Exelon Corporation Quarterly Incentive Award Program shall be credited for the period such amounts are earned, regardless of when
such amounts are actually paid).      A Participant s Accrued Benefit, however, shall not be less than the largest early retirement benefit
that he could at any time elect to receive under the Plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the early retirement benefit that a Participant may elect to receive at any time of reference is the monthly annuity which, assuming he had a
Separation from Service on the date of reference, would be payable to him in the form of a Single Life Annuity beginning as of the later of the day ten years prior to his Normal Retirement Date or the first day of the month following the date of
reference.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Accrued Benefit of a Power Team Employee shall be frozen as of the date the Employee becomes a
Power Team Employee and no Power Team Employee shall earn any additional Accrued Benefit under the Plan while the Employee is a Power Team Employee. The calculation of the benefit of a Power Team Employee under subsection (a) and (b) shall
be made without regard to any Compensation, annual base salary or earnings attributable to any period while the Employee is a Power Team Employee.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an EIS Senior Management Employee s Accrued Benefit shall be frozen as of October 31, 1999, or the date such Participant becomes an EIS Senior Management Employee,
if later, and no EIS Senior Management Employee shall earn any additional Accrued Benefit under the Plan after such date. The calculation of an EIS Senior Management Employee s benefit under subsection (a) and (b) shall be made
without regard to any Compensation, annual base salary or earnings attributable to any period after October 31, 1999, or the date such Participant becomes an EIS Senior Management Employee, if later.   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1, the Accrued Benefit for a TXU Participant shall be equal to the greater of
(1) such Participant s accrued benefit under the TXU Pension Plan immediately prior to the closing date of the acquisition of TXU by the Company, and (2) such Participant s Accrued Benefit determined under subsection
(b) above, calculated by including compensation earned by the Participant while he was employed by TXU to the extent such compensation would have been included under subsection (b) if TXU had been part of the
  
         15   

Company during the relevant time period and by including the years of service that were credited to the Participant under the TXU Pension Plan immediately prior to the closing date of the
acquisition of TXU by the Company.      3.2 Minimum Accrued Benefit. Except as provided in Section 6.5:

in each case under the provisions of the Plan as in effect through December 31, 1993; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, base salary for any determination period (as defined in Section 3.3)
that is taken into account in determining an Employee s average annual base salary as of December 31, 1993 shall be subject to the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit (as defined in Section 3.3) in effect for 1993; plus
     (2) the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined under Section 3.1 based on the Participant s

completes an Hour of Service on or after January 1, 1994 and whose Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1994 is based on annual Compensation or base salary for a determination period (as defined in Section 3.3)
beginning prior to January 1, 1994 that exceeds $150,000.      3.3 Application of Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit.
Annual Compensation taken into account for purposes of Section 3.1(a) (and Articles IVA, IVB and   
         16   

IVC) and annual base salary taken into account for purposes of Section 3.1(b) (and Articles IVA, IVB and IVC) shall not exceed $200,000 ($150,000, effective January 1, 1994), or such
other amount as may be applicable under Code Section 401(a)(17) (the  Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit ). Except as provided below, the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit in effect for a calendar year applies to any
period, not exceeding 12 months, over which Compensation or base salary is determined ( determination period ) and which begins in such calendar year. Annual base salary for any determination period beginning prior to 1989 that is taken
into account in determining an Employee s average annual base salary for purposes of determining the Employee s Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1989 but prior to January 1, 1994 shall be subject to the
Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit in effect for 1989. Annual base salary for any determination period beginning prior to 1994 that is taken into account in determining an Employee s average annual base salary for purposes of
determining the Employee s Accrued Benefit as of a date on or after January 1, 1994 shall be subject to the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit in effect for 1994.   
  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the Section 401(a)(17) Compensation Limit will be multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1997, the family aggregation rules of Sections 401(a)(17)(A) of the Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1996, shall apply.      3.4 Transferred Employees. The Accrued Benefit of a Participant who has ceased
to be an Eligible Employee but who is still an Employee shall be calculated on the basis of his Compensation, average annual base salary, Benefit Years, and the formula in effect under this Article III as of the last date on which he is an Eligible
Employee.      3.5 Rehired Employees. A Participant who is reemployed as an Employee and who continues, or commences, his pension
payments during the period of his reemployment shall, as required to continue pension payments in accordance with the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees, waive participation in, or additional benefits and accruals under the
Plan and accordingly, shall not be entitled to accrue any additional benefits under the Plan during his period of reemployment.       

ARTICLE IV.  
  Benefits.          4.1 Normal
Retirement. If an Active Participant has not already become vested pursuant to Section 4.4, he shall become fully vested in his Accrued Benefit when he attains Age 65, or, if later, upon the fifth anniversary of the date upon which he first
became an Active Participant and may retire on his Normal Retirement Date. Upon retiring, the Participant shall be entitled to a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month following the month in which his Normal Retirement Date
occurs and is equal to his Accrued Benefit.      4.2 Postponed Retirement.   
  (a) An employee may continue in service after his Normal Retirement Date. Except as provided in Section 4.11, an
Active Participant who continues in service   
         17   

after his Normal Retirement Date shall receive an annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following actual retirement, or as of his Required Beginning Date, if earlier. Such annuity
shall be based upon service, Compensation, average annual base salary and Covered Compensation measured as of the date he retires or his Required Beginning Date, whichever applies, and the benefit formula under Section 3.1 in effect as of such
date. Effective as of January 1, 2000, the annuity for an Employee whose Retirement Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which he incurs a Separation from Service shall include an Actuarial Equivalent
adjustment to reflect commencement of payments after April 1 following the calendar year in which he attained age 70   1   /  2  . The Actuarial Equivalent adjustment described in the preceding sentence shall be made to Participant s Accrued Benefit as of each December 31 following his Required
Beginning Date and preceding his Separation from Service, with the last such adjustment made as of his Separation from Service, and for each such year or portion of a year, shall reduce (but not below zero) any increase in the Participant s
Accrued Benefit for the year or portion of a year attributable to Benefit Years, Compensation, annual base salary, or changes in Covered Compensation for that year or portion of a year.    
  (b) Notwithstanding Paragraph (a), effective January 1, 1994, an executive shall continue as an Employee after his
Normal Retirement Date only with the consent of the Company or an Affiliate. For purposes of this Paragraph (b), an  executive  means a Participant who:   
  (1) Is (A) bona fide executive as defined in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations   541.1 and 1625.12 or
(B) employed in a high policy making position in the Company or an Affiliate within the meaning of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations  1625.12;      (2) Has attained Age 65;      (3) Has been in a position described in
Paragraph (1) for the two-year period immediately prior to his retirement; and      (4) Is entitled to an
immediate vested annual retirement pension, commencing at Age 65 (or retirement, if later), from all employee pension, profit sharing, savings and deferred compensation plans sponsored by the Company and all Affiliates which equals, in the
aggregate, at least $44,000 (or such other amount as may be prescribed pursuant to Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations  541.1 from time to time). In calculating the annual retirement pension, (A) all benefits shall be adjusted in
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission so that the benefit is the equivalent of a Single Life Annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no
rollover contributions have been made and (B) there shall be excluded from the calculation of the retirement pension amounts attributable to Social Security, employee contributions, contributions of prior employers, rollover contributions, and
contributions described in Code  402(e)(3).   
         18   

(a) If a Participant s Benefit Commencement Date precedes his actual
retirement, the pension payable to the Participant shall be determined as of the December 31 preceding his Benefit Commencement Date and adjusted as of January 1 in each calendar year following his Benefit Commencement Date, with the final
adjustment to be made as of the date of his actual retirement. Such annual adjustment shall include any increase (but not any decrease) in the Participant s Accrued Benefit, determined in accordance with Article III, as a result of additional
Benefit Years and Compensation and changes to average annual base salary, since the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or the last such annual adjustment, whichever applies.   
  4.3 Early Retirement.      (a) Effective August 1, 2000, an Active Participant who terminates after he has attained Age 50 and has to his credit at least 10 Vesting Years may retire and shall upon so retiring be entitled to a
monthly annuity that begins, at his election, as of the first day of the month following his retirement or as of the first day of any subsequent month, but not after the first month following his Normal Retirement Date. Such election may be made no
earlier than 90 days prior to the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Participant and in no event earlier than the date on which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a). The amount of the annuity under this
Subsection 4.3(a) shall be equal to the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined as of his Benefit Commencement Date reduced as follows:       
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this subsection (a), effective January 1, 2002, there shall be no reduction to the Accrued Benefit of an Active Participant who is an hourly, nonexempt Eligible Employee and who has attained age 59 at the time of his Benefit Commencement
Date.      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who has ceased to be
an Active Participant because he is an EIS Senior Management Employee, or because he has ceased to be an Employee of the Company and has thereupon become an Employee of EIS, shall continue to be treated as an Active
  
         19   

Participant for purposes of this Section 4.3 and, effective January 1, 2002, Section 5.3, but not for any other provision of the Plan, so long as (i) he continuously remains
an Employee of EIS or a wholly owned subsidiary of EIS and (ii) EIS continuously remains an Affiliate.   
  (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who has ceased to be an Eligible
Employee and Active Participant because he is a Power Team Employee, shall continue to be treated as an Active Participant for purposes of this Section 4.3 and, effective December 31, 1996, Section 5.3, but not for any other provision
of the Plan, so long as he continuously remains a Power Team Employee.      4.4 Deferred Annuity. Effective as of August 1,
2000, any Participant who has a Separation from Service prior to satisfying the requirements for retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3 but at a time when he has to his credit at least five Vesting Years shall upon his Separation from Service be entitled
to receive a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month following his Normal Retirement Date and is equal to his Accrued Benefit determined as of his Separation from Service. Alternatively, a Participant described in the preceding
sentence may, at his election, receive a monthly annuity that begins as of the first day of the month following his fiftieth birthday or, at his option, on the first day of any month thereafter but not after the first month following his Normal
Retirement Date that is equal to the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined as of his Separation from Service. Any election of a Benefit Commencement Date prior to Normal Retirement Date made under this Section may
be made no earlier than 90 days prior to the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Participant and in no event earlier than the date on which the Participant receives the notice described in Section 5.5(a).   
  4.5 Disabled Eligible Employees. A Participant who has become disabled within the meaning of the Company s Disabilitant benefit
plans while an Eligible Employee shall continue to be credited with Benefit Years and Vesting Years during his period of Disabilitant to the extent set forth in Sections 1.7 (relating to Benefit Accrual Computation Period), 1.9 (relating to Benefit
Year), 1.19 (relating to Employment) and 1.37 (relating to Vesting Service). If a disabled Participant has met the requirements to receive a pension under any Section of this Article IV (determined as if his Separation from Service had occurred on
the date of reference), such Participant may elect as his Benefit Commencement Date any date as may be provided under the applicable Section. If a disabled Participant continues to be credited with Benefit Years after his Benefit Commencement Date,
the amount of annuity payable to the Participant shall be determined as of his Benefit Commencement Date and shall be adjusted annually as of January 1 in each calendar year following his Benefit Commencement Date, up to and including the
January 1 next following the date the disabled Participant ceases to be credited with Benefit Years. Such annual adjustment shall include any increase (but not any decrease) in the Participant s Accrued Benefit, determined in accordance
with Article III, as a result of additional Benefit Years and Compensation and changes to average annual base salary, since the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or the last such annual adjustment, whichever applies. In addition, such
annual adjustment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the Actuarial Equivalent of any benefit paid to the Participant since his Benefit Commencement Date during any period (a) prior to Normal Retirement Date or (b) after Normal
Retirement Date   
         20   

that would have constituted  Section 202(a)(3)(B) Service  under Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations  2530.203-3(c)(1), to the extent not previously taken into account under this
Section; provided, however, that the amount, if any, of the benefits paid to the Participant which exceeds the amount the Participant would have received if distribution had been made in the normal form of benefits described in Section 5.1 or
5.2(a), whichever applies to the Participant, shall be disregarded in determining the Actuarial Equivalent of such benefits for purposes of the reduction described in this sentence.   
  4.6 Maximum Annuity. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the amount of the Participant s annual benefit
(as defined below) accrued, distributed or payable at any time under the Plan shall be limited to an amount such that such annual benefit and the aggregate annual benefit of the Participant under all other defined benefit plans maintained by the
Employer or any other Affiliate does not exceed the lesser of:      (i) $160,000 (as increased to reflect the cost
of living adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the Code), multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of participation (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
  1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii)) and the denominator of which is 10; or.      (ii) an amount equal to 100% of the
Participant s average compensation for the 3 consecutive calendar years in which his compensation was the highest (as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(a)(5)) and which are included in his years of service (within the
meaning of Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii)) with the Employers multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of service with the Employers and the denominator of
which is 10.      The dollar amount set forth in clause (i) of the preceding paragraph shall be actuarially reduced in
accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(d) if pension benefits commence prior to the Participant s attainment of age 62. If a Participant s pension benefit payments commence after the Participant s attainment of age 65, such
dollar amount shall be actuarially increased in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(e).      A Participant s
 annual benefit  shall mean the Participant s accrued benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity, as determined in, and accordance with, Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(b). If the annual benefit is payable in a form
other than a single life annuity, the annual benefit shall be adjusted to the Actuarial Equivalent of a single life annuity using the assumptions of the following sentences;  provided ,  however , that no adjustment shall be required for
survivor benefits payable to a surviving Spouse under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (as described in Section 5.2) to the extent such benefits would not be payable if the Participant s annual benefit were paid in another form.
     Effective for Plan Years beginning January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005, for any form of benefit subject to
Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greater of (i) the amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table used to determine actuarial equivalence under the Plan and (ii) the amount
computed using an interest rate assumption of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table under Treas. Reg.   1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the  Applicable Mortality Table ). Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for
any form of benefit subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be the greatest of (i) the amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table used to determine actuarial equivalence under
the Plan, (ii) the amount computed using an interest rate assumption of 5.5% and the Applicable Mortality Table and (iii) the amount computed using the applicable interest rate under Treas. Reg.   1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the Applicable
Mortality Table, divided by 1.05. Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1,   
         21   

2006, for any form of benefit not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be determined in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(c). An
individual s  annual benefit  under any other defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer and Affiliate shall be as determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder the
terms of such plan.      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the limitation provided by this Section shall
not apply to a Participant who has not at any time participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by any Employer and whose annual benefit under the Plan does not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than
1/10th) the numerator of which is the Participant s years of service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii)) and the denominator of which is 10.      For purposes of this Section, the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in Section 415(c)(3) of the Code and the applicable Regulations, the term  defined contribution
plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.415(c)-1(a)(2), the term  defined benefit plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treas. Reg.   1.415(b)-1(a)(2) and the term  Employer  shall include the
Employers and all corporations and entities required to be aggregated with any of the Employers pursuant to Section 414(b) and (c) of the Code as modified by Section 415(h) of the Code.   
  4.7 Benefit Commencement Date. Unless the Participant elects otherwise, the pension to which he is entitled under this Article IV or
Articles IVA or IVB shall begin within sixty days of the close of the Plan Year in which falls the later of his Normal Retirement Date or his Separation from Service. The failure of the Participant to apply for his benefit pursuant to
Section 5.9 by the date prescribed in the preceding sentence shall be deemed an election to defer payment to a later date. Notwithstanding the above, payment of such pension shall begin no later than a Participant s Required Beginning
Date, or the first day of the month following the date the Participant first becomes entitled to such pension, if later.      4.8
Post-Retirement Adjustment.      (a) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1978, benefit payments to
Participants who retired under Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, or corresponding prior Sections, prior to January 1, 1978 and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 2% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 4%.
     (b) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1980, benefit payments to Participants who retired
under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1980 and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 3% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 6%.   
  (c) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1982, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the

  (d) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1984, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the
foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to   
         22

  (e) Commencing with installments due September 1, 1986, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the
foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1986, and their Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries are increased by 2% for each calendar year of retirement to a maximum of 4%.   
  (f) Commencing with installments due February 1, 1991, benefit payments to:   
  (1) Participants who retired under Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 of the Plan (or corresponding prior Sections) prior to
January 1, 1990;      (2) Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who died or
retired under the foregoing provisions prior to January 1, 1990;      (3) Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity beneficiaries of deceased Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions prior to January 1, 1990; and      (4) surviving Spouses receiving benefits under Section 5.4 due to the death of a Participant while an Active Participant prior to January 1, 1990, are increased by a factor of 3/4 of 1%
multiplied by the difference obtained by subtracting the Participant s year of retirement or death, as appropriate, from 1990. A Participant or beneficiary described in this Paragraph (f) may irrevocably elect to waive this increase in
benefit payments by written notice to the Company made no later than 60 days after the Participant or beneficiary is first notified of the increase by the Company.   
  (g) Commencing with installments due February 1, 1997, benefit payments to Participants who retired under the
foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, and Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who died or retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, are increased by fifty
dollars ($50) per month.      (h) Commencing with installments due January 1, 2000, benefit payments to
Participants who retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to January 1, 1994, and Contingent Annuity Option beneficiaries of deceased Participants who died or retired under the foregoing provisions of the Plan prior to
January 1, 1994, are increased by fifty dollars ($50) per month.      4.9 Special Early Retirement Benefit. The annuity (and
any Contingent Annuity Option benefit) of a Participant who retires under the early retirement provisions of Section 4.3 between February 1, 1978 and June 1, 1978, inclusive, shall be computed without the 4% per year reduction
described in the last sentence of Section 4.3. In addition, the monthly benefit paid to such a Participant (but not the benefit to any Contingent Annuity Option beneficiary) shall be supplemented by a monthly payment equal to the Social
Security old age insurance benefit to which the Participant would be entitled at Age 65 based on earnings   
         23   

received as an Employee of the Company, assuming he has no wages for Social Security purposes after his retirement and there is no change in the Social Security law or rates subsequent to his
retirement. The supplemental benefit described in the preceding sentence shall end with the payment on the first day of the month preceding the month in which the Participant first receives (or could have received if he had applied) Social Security
old age insurance benefits unreduced on account of age, or with the payment last preceding the Participant s death, if earlier. The special benefits described in this Section shall also be paid with respect to a Participant who elects early
retirement during the period February 1, 1978 through June 1, 1978, inclusive, but whose actual retirement is postponed at the request of the Company in order to provide for personnel replacement and training.   
  4.10 Minimum Annuity. The annuity of a Participant who retires or has retired under Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, or corresponding prior
Sections regardless of the form of his benefit under Article V, and who is not at any time a Highly Compensated Employee, shall not be less than $150 per month.      4.11 Suspension of Benefits. With respect to any Participant whose employment by the Company or an Affiliate continues past his Normal Retirement Date, or who is receiving benefits under the Plan and
again becomes an Employee, the following rules shall apply:      (a) If the reemployed Participant has not reached
his Normal Retirement Date, his pension shall be suspended and recomputed under the Plan upon his subsequent Separation from Service.      (b) If the Participant has reached his Normal Retirement Date, for each calendar month or for each four or five week payroll period ending in a calendar month during which the Participant either completes
forty or more Hours of Service (counting each day of Employment as five Hours of Service), or receives payment for any such Hours of Service performed on each of eight or more days or separate work shifts in such month or payroll period, (referred
to herein as  Suspension Service ) no pension payment shall be made, and no adjustment to the Participant s pension shall be made on account of such non-payment. No payment shall be withheld pursuant to this Paragraph (b) until
the Employee is notified by personal delivery or first class mail during the first calendar month or payroll period in which payments are suspended that his benefits are suspended. Such notification shall contain a description of the specific
reasons why benefit payments are being suspended, a general description of the Plan provisions relating to the suspension of payments and a copy of such provisions (or a reference to the relevant pages of the summary plan description providing such
information), and a statement to the effect that applicable Department of Labor Regulations may be found in Section 2530.203-3 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In addition, the suspension notification shall inform the Employee of the
Plan s procedure for affording a review of the suspension of benefits.      (c) The pension of a reemployed
Participant whose benefits were suspended under this Section 4.11 shall begin again no later than the earlier of (1) the first day of the third month following the month in which the Participant first fails to
  
         24   

satisfy the service requirements described in Paragraph (b) or has a Separation from Service or (2) his Required Beginning Date. The resumed pension shall be recalculated to reflect
Compensation, average annual base salary and Benefit Years earned under the Plan as in effect during such period of reemployment and shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any payment received by the Employee under the Plan prior to his
Normal Retirement Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Participant s monthly pension payable in the form of a single life annuity when reemployment ends be less than the monthly pension that was payable to the Participant in the
form of a single life annuity prior to his period of reemployment. The full amount of the resumed pension shall be paid in the form determined pursuant to Article V at the time payments are resumed, without regard to the form of payment in effect
for the Participant prior to his reemployment. The pension of any Participant whose employment continued past his Normal Retirement Date (and whose benefits are not suspended because of employment as described in Paragraph (b)) shall be paid
pursuant to Section 4.2.      (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, a
Participant who received a pension while the Participant worked for Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation) before the assets of Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland
corporation) were acquired by EIS or its Affiliate, shall not have his pension suspended under this Section 4.11 solely as a result of the acquisition of the assets of Linden Chapel Corporation (formerly known as VSI Group, Inc., a Maryland
corporation) by EIS or its Affiliate, so long as the Participant remains continuously employed thereafter by the Company or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, this Section 4.11 shall not apply to a
Participant who is reemployed by an Affiliated Company that does not maintain a defined benefit pension plan.   
  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, a reemployed Participant who is employed under
circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees shall not have his pension suspended under this Section 4.11 nor
shall such reemployed Participant be prohibited from commencing his pension if he is otherwise eligible to commence such pension.      Section 4.12. Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s
 Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage  (the  AFTAP ), as defined in Section 436(j) of the Code, is at or below the following levels.   
  (i) If the Plan s AFTAP is 60% or greater but less than 80% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited
payment (as defined in Section 4.12(a)(iv)) after the valuation date for the Plan Year to the extent the amount of the payment exceeds the lesser of (x) 50% of the amount of the payment which could be made without regard to the
restrictions under this subsection 4.13 and (y) the present value (determined pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under Section 417(e) of the Code) of
the maximum guarantee with respect to the Participant under Section 4022 of ERISA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, only one such prohibited payment may be made with respect to any Participant during any period of consecutive Plan Years
to which the   
         25   

limitations under either clause (x) or (y) of the preceding sentence apply. For purposes of this Section 4.12(a)(i), a Participant, his beneficiary and any alternate payee (as
defined in Section 414(p)(8) of the Code) shall be deemed a single  Participant.       (ii) If the
Plan s AFTAP is less than 60% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited payment after the valuation date for the Plan Year.      (iii) During any period in which the Company is a debtor in a case under Title 11, United States Code (or similar federal or state law), the Plan shall not make any prohibited payment. The preceding
sentence shall not apply on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled actuary certifies that the AFTAP is not less than 100%.      (iv) For purposes of this Section 4.12(a), the term  prohibited payment  means (x) any payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any social
security supplements described in the last sentence of Section 411(a)(9) of the Code) to a Participant or beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in Section 417(f)(2) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder)
occurs during any period a limitation under Section 4.12(a)(ii) or (iii) is in effect, (y) any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or (z) any other payment specified by the
Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.      (b) In any Plan Year in which the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan
Year is less than 60%, benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the valuation date for the Plan Year. This restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the
Company of a contribution (in addition to any minimum required contribution under Section 430 of the Code) equal to the amount sufficient to result in an AFTAP of 60%.   
  (c) No amendment which has the effect of increasing Plan liabilities by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of
new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accruals or the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable shall take effect during any Plan Year if the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 80% or would be less than 80% after taking into
account such amendment; provided, however, that the preceding restriction shall not apply to an amendment which provides for an increase in benefits under a formula which is not based on a Participant s compensation if the rate of such increase
is not in excess of the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of Participants covered by the amendment; and provided, further, that such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the
Plan Year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment), upon payment by the Company of a contribution as described in Section 436(c)(2) of the Code.      (d) The Plan shall not provide an unpredictable contingent event benefit payable with respect to any event occurring during any Plan Year if the AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60% or would be less
than 60% after taking into account such occurrence; provided, however, such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company of a contribution as described in
Section 436(b)(2) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 4.12(d), the term  unpredictable contingent event benefit  means any benefit payable solely by reason of a plant shutdown (or similar event, as determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury), or any event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or occurrence of death or disability.   
  (e) To avoid benefit restrictions, the Company may take any action permitted by Section 436 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.      (f) The provisions of this Section 4.12 are intended to comply with
Section 436 of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall be construed to comply therewith.      4.13.

salary, a Participant s annual base salary shall not exceed $200,000 (or such other amount as may apply under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the calendar year in which the last of such 12-consecutive-month periods ends.) In determining

  (c) If the Participant s annuity (including any Contingent Annuity Option benefit) is paid pursuant to
Section 4.3, such annuity shall be computed without regard to the 4% per year reduction described in the last sentence of such Section.      4A.4 Special Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan:

contingent beneficiary or to the Participant s estate.      (B) If an Eligible Participant (1) is
unmarried at the time of his death, (2) is survived by one or more children, (3) has not begun receiving any benefits hereunder, and (4) either has failed to make a valid election under Paragraph (A) or is not survived by a
designated contingent beneficiary, a benefit equal to the amount that would be payable assuming that the Participant made a valid election under Paragraph (a) and designated a percentage of 100% shall be paid to the Participant s surviving
children, if any, in equal shares. For all purposes of the Plan, where applicable, the person to whom benefits are payable pursuant to this Paragraph (b) shall be treated as the Participant s contingent beneficiary.   
  (c) Except as provided in Paragraph (b):   
  (1) If an electing Participant who has had a Separation from Service whose Contingent Annuity Option has not been
canceled dies on or after the effective date of the option, his contingent beneficiary, if surviving, will receive an annuity for life beginning as of the first day of the second month following his death and based upon the designated percentage of
the annuity which the Participant was receiving or to which he would have been entitled; provided, however, that, if the contingent beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse and the designated percentage is at least 50%, payment to the
Spouse shall not begin prior to what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date without the Spouse s written consent made within the 90-day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date.   
  (2) If an electing Active Participant dies on or after the effective date of the option, his contingent beneficiary, if
living, shall receive an annuity, for life, beginning as of the first day of the second month following the month in which the Participant s death occurs, based upon the designated percentage of the benefit to which the Participant would have
been immediately entitled if he had retired on the date of his death; provided, however, that, if the contingent beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse, the designated percentage shall be deemed to be 100%, and payment to such Spouse
shall not begin prior to what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date without the Spouse s written consent made within the 90-day period preceding the Benefit Commencement Date. For purposes of this Subparagraph only, the
annuity to which a Participant would have been entitled shall be his Accrued Benefit reduced in accordance with Section 4.3 and, if applicable, reduced further by 4% per year (to the nearest one-twelfth year) for any period by which his
age at the time of his death is less than 50.   
         51   

(d) (1) If the contingent beneficiary dies after the effective date of the
option and after the later of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or his Separation from Service, the reduced annuity payable to the Participant will remain in effect.   
  (2) If the contingent beneficiary dies after the effective date of the option, but prior to the later of the
Participant s Normal Retirement Date or his Separation from Service, the option shall be canceled upon receipt of proof of death. If the Participant has not then reached his Normal Retirement Date or has not had a Separation from Service, the
Participant may elect a subsequent Contingent Annuity Option effective immediately upon notice to the Company, subject to the conditions stated herein. If he has reached his Normal Retirement Date and has had a Separation from Service, the
Participant may not make any further elections.      (e) Subject to the conditions of Paragraph (a), an Eligible
Participant may make or change his election and designate or change a beneficiary and/or designate a revised benefit percentage at any time prior to the later of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or Separation from Service. An Eligible
Participant may, regardless of whether he has previously made a different election under this Section 5.3, elect in writing to receive his annuity in the form provided in Section 5.1 or 5.2, whichever applies, or in such other form as is
permitted under Paragraph (a), subject to the provisions of Section 5.7. The Participant may make such an election at any time before the Benefit Commencement Date but such an election may not be revoked after the Benefit Commencement Date,
except as provided in Paragraph (d)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective July 15, 1990, a Participant who has not reached his Normal Retirement Date and who elects a form of benefit under this Section 5.3 may waive any right to
change his election in the future and irrevocably elect a specific Contingent Annuity Option as of his Benefit Commencement Date.      (f) Commencing with payments due September 1, 1986, the minimum monthly annuity to which a designated beneficiary under a Contingent Annuity Option described in this Section 5.3 shall be
entitled is $150.      5.4 Death Benefits for Other Vested Participants.   
  (a) Eligibility. A death benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.4 with respect to a Participant who dies prior
to his Benefit Commencement Date if on the date of his death he is married and:      (1) he does not meet the
requirements for the Contingent Annuity Option described in Section 5.3, and      (A) he is an Employee who
has met the requirements for early or normal retirement under the Plan; or      (B) he is a former Employee who
has had a Separation from Service after meeting the requirements of Section 4.3; or   
         52   

(C) he has been married for at least one year to the same Spouse and has at
least five Vesting Years to his credit, or      (2) he does meet the requirements described in Section 5.3
but has made no election, or has made an invalid election, under that Section.      (b) Amount of Benefit. Upon the
death of a Participant described in Section 5.4(a), the Participant s surviving Spouse, if living on the date set forth in Subparagraph (1)-(4) of this Section, whichever shall apply, shall receive a pension in accordance with the
following rules:      (1) If the Participant is an Employee who has met the requirements for retirement under
Sections 4.1-4.3, the pension to the surviving Spouse shall begin, as elected in writing by the Spouse not more than 90 days prior to the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, on the first day of the month following the month in which the
Participant s death occurs or the first day of any month thereafter, shall end with the payment on the first day of the month in which the Spouse s death occurs, and shall be in a monthly amount equal to the amount the Spouse would have
received if the Participant had a Separation from Service on the date of his death, had survived and retired on the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Spouse and had elected an immediate pension in the form of a 100% Contingent Annuity Option;
provided, however, that (A) the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date shall not be later than the later of (i) the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or (ii) the first day of the month following the month in which the
Participant s death occurs and (B) the benefit payable to the Spouse of a Participant described in Section 5.4(a)(2) shall be determined without regard to any otherwise applicable actuarial reduction reflecting the cost of the 100%
Contingent Annuity Option.      (2) If the Participant is an Employee who has not met the requirements for
retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3, the pension to the surviving Spouse shall begin, as elected in writing by the Spouse not more than 90 days prior to the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, on the first day of the month following the month in
which the Participant would have first been eligible to receive his pension under Section 4.4 if he had a Separation from Service on the date of his death and had not died, or the first day of any month thereafter, shall end with the payment on
the first day of the month in which the Spouse s death occurs, and shall be in a monthly amount equal to the amount the Spouse would have received if the Participant s Separation from Service had occurred on the day of his death and he had
survived and elected to begin receiving his pension in the form of a 100% Contingent Annuity Option on the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Spouse; provided, however, that (A) the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date shall not be
later than what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date and (B) the benefit payable to the Spouse of a Participant described in Section 5.4(a)(2) shall be determined without regard to any otherwise applicable
actuarial reduction reflecting the cost of the 100% Contingent Annuity Option.   
         53   

(3) If the Participant is a former Employee who retired under Sections
4.1-4.3, the pension to the surviving Spouse shall begin, as elected in writing by the Spouse not more than 90 days prior to the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, on the first day of the month following the month in which the
Participant s death occurs or the first day of any month thereafter, shall end with the payment on the first day of the month in which the Spouse s death occurs, and shall be in a monthly amount equal to the amount the Spouse would have
received if the Participant had elected to begin receiving his pension in the form of a 100% Contingent Annuity Option on the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Spouse; provided, however, that (A) the Spouse s Benefit Commencement
Date shall not be later than the later of (i) the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or (ii) the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant s death occurs and (B) the benefit payable to the Spouse
of a Participant described in Section 5.4(a)(2) shall be determined without regard to any otherwise applicable actuarial reduction reflecting the cost of the 100% Contingent Annuity Option.   
  (4) If the Participant is a former Employee who did not meet the requirements for retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3, the
pension to the surviving Spouse shall begin, as elected in writing by the Spouse not more than 90 days prior to the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, on the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant would have first
been eligible to receive his pension under Section 4.4 if he had not died or the first day of any month thereafter, shall end with the payment on the first day of the month in which the Spouse s death occurs, and shall be in a monthly
amount equal to the amount the Spouse would have received if the Participant elected to begin receiving his actual pension in the form of a 100% Contingent Annuity Option on the Benefit Commencement Date elected by the Spouse; provided, however,
that the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date shall not be later than what would have been the Participant s Normal Retirement Date.      5.5 Notice to Participants.      (a) Each Participant shall receive in
written nontechnical language a general description or explanation of (1) the forms of payment described in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, including information explaining the relative values of each form of payment, (2) the Participant s
right to waive the form of payment described in Section 5.1 or 5.2(a), whichever applies, and elect an optional form of payment and the financial effect of such an election on his pension, (3) the rights of the Participant s Spouse,
if any, with respect to the waiver and election, (4) the Participant s right to revoke an election to receive an optional form of payment and the effect of such revocation, (5) if the Participant has not reached his Normal Retirement
Date, the Participant s right to defer commencement of his pension until his Normal Retirement Date and the financial effect of such deferment, and (6) a description of the relative value of the optional forms of benefit as compared to the
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. Such information shall be furnished to the Participant not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days prior to the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date, and the time for an election under this Section
shall begin no earlier than the date such information is furnished.   
         54   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for Plan Years beginning on or
after January 1, 1997, the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date may be fewer than 30 days after the explanation described in this Section is provided if:   
  (1) the Participant is given notice of his right to a 30-day period in which to consider whether to (i) waive the
normal form of benefit and elect an optional form and (ii) to the extent applicable, consent to the distribution;      (2) the Participant affirmatively elects a distribution and a form of benefit and the Spouse, if necessary, consents to the form of the benefit elected;   
  (3) the Participant is permitted to revoke his affirmative election at any time prior to his Benefit Commencement Date,
or if later, the expiration of a 7-day period beginning on the day after the explanation described in this Section is provided to the Participant;      (4) the Benefit Commencement Date is after the date the Administrator receives written notice of the Participant s intent to begin receiving benefits; and   
  (5) distribution to the Participant does not commence before the expiration of the 7-day period described in paragraph
(3) above.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1,
2004, the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date may precede the explanation described in this Section, if the Participant so elects, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:   
  (1) the date the on which the first payment to be received by the Participant is made (the  initial payment
date ) shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early as the seventh day after such notice is provided if (i) such
notice clearly indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided under the Plan and to elect (with spousal consent) an optional
form of benefit, (ii) the Participant affirmatively elects a form of distribution with the consent of his Spouse (if required) to commence as of the initial payment date, and (iii) the Participant is permitted to revoke such election until
the initial payment date;      (2) the notice shall be provided to the Participant no more than ninety
(90) days before the initial payment date, however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)- day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;   
  (3) the Participant is not permitted to elect an Benefit Commencement Date that precedes the date upon which the
Participant could have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in effect on the Benefit Commencement Date;   
         55   

(4) to the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for the
period from the Benefit Commencement Date to the initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the
period beginning on the Benefit Commencement Date and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the
adjustment described in the preceding sentence shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Annuity Starting Date on or after January 1, 2008, the interest
rate used to compute the adjustment described in the sentence above shall be the interest rate as specified or prescribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code, in revenue rulings,
notices or other guidance for November of the preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 4.6 of the Plan, the limitations set forth therein shall comply with the adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with
respect to any Benefit Commencement Date described in this paragraph which is a  retroactive annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and   
  (5) if a Participant who is married elects to commence the Participant s benefit as of the initial payment date
pursuant to this paragraph, then the Participant s Spouse (including an alternate payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified domestic relations order), determined as of the initial payment date, must consent to such
election if the survivor benefits payable as of the Benefit Commencement Date are less than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in Section 5.2(a) of the Plan as of the initial payment date.   
  (b) Each Eligible Participant described in Section 5.3(a) shall receive a written explanation of (1) the terms
and conditions of the pre-retirement survivor annuity described in Section 5.4, (2) the Participant s right to waive such survivor annuity in favor of the death benefit under a Contingent Annuity Option and the effect of such waiver,
(3) the rights of the Participant s Spouse with respect to such waiver, and (4) the Participant s right to revoke such waiver and the effect of such revocation. Such explanation shall be provided when the Participant first
becomes an Eligible Participant described in Section 5.3(a) and, if the Eligible Participant has not attained Age 32 at the time of the first notice, again within the three-year period that begins on the first day of the Plan Year in which the
Participant attains Age 32.      5.6 Cash-Outs. Effective on such date as shall be determined by the Company, if the Actuarial
Equivalent single-sum value, determined as of the date of distribution, of the vested Accrued Benefit of a Participant who has had a Separation from Service, or of the benefit payable to a Spouse or other beneficiary under Section 5.3 or 5.4 by
reason of the Participant s death prior to his Benefit Commencement Date, is $5,000 or less, or, for distributions occurring on or after March 28, 2005, $1,000 or less, the benefit shall be paid, as soon as administratively practicable
following the later of (a) the Participant s Separation from Service or death, or (b) the effective date of this Section 5.6, as a single-sum in settlement of all   
         56   

liabilities of the Plan in connection with the Participant; provided, however, that no such payment shall be made after such benefit has commenced in any other form.   
  5.7 Spousal Consent. No Participant s election:   
  (a) to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in favor of a form of payment other than a Contingent Annuity Option
providing for payment of at least 50% of the Participant s annuity to his surviving Spouse, or      (b) to
waive the death benefit described in Section 5.4 in favor of the death benefit payable under a form of payment other than a Contingent Annuity Option described in Paragraph (a), above,      shall be effective with respect to a Participant who is married unless the Participant s Spouse (as of the Benefit Commencement Date or date of death, whichever applies) consents thereto in writing,
and such consent (1) acknowledges the effect of the election, (2) specifies the designated beneficiary or consents to such designation and consents prospectively to any subsequent designation of beneficiary made by the Participant,
acknowledging the Spouse s right to limit consent to a specific alternate beneficiary, (3) specifies the optional form of payment or consents to such election and consents prospectively to any subsequent choice of optional form made by the
Participant, acknowledging the Spouse s right to limit consent to a specific optional form, and (4) is witnessed by a Plan representative or by a notary public, or the Administrator finds that the Spouse cannot be located.   
  5.8 Minimum Distribution Requirements. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the form and timing of all distributions
under the Plan to any Participant, including a Participant whose Separation from Service occurred prior to January 1, 1989, shall be in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, including the
incidental death benefit requirements of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Code and Treas. Reg.  1.401(a)(9)-2.      5.9
Application for Benefits. Except as provided in Section 5.6 or in Section 5.3(c) for a non-Spouse contingent beneficiary, benefit payments shall commence when properly written application for same is received by the Administrator. In the
event that a Participant, or the Spouse of a deceased Participant entitled to benefits under the Plan fails to apply to the Administrator by the earlier of (a) the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or the date of the Participant s
Separation from service, if later, or (b) the end of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2, the Administrator shall make diligent efforts to locate such Participant or Spouse and obtain such application. In the event the
Participant or Spouse fails to make application by the Participant s Required Beginning Date, subject to Section 10.6, the Administrator shall commence distribution as of the Required Beginning Date without such application. No payments
shall be made for the period in which benefits would have been payable if the Participant or Spouse had made timely application therefor; provided, however, that, if the Participant s Benefit Commencement Date or, if the Participant has died,
his Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, has been delayed until after the Participant s Normal Retirement Date solely by reason of failure to make application, and not by reason of Suspension Service as described in Section 4.11(b),
the benefit payable (i) to the Participant on and after his Benefit   
         57   

Commencement Date, or (ii) to the Participant s Spouse on and after the Spouse s Benefit Commencement Date, shall be equal to the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit the
Participant or the Spouse would have received had benefits commenced on the Participant s Normal Retirement Date, as determined to reflect the deferral of benefit commencement.   
  5.10 Direct Rollovers. In the event any payment or payments under the Plan to be made to a  eligible distributee  would
constitute an  eligible rollover distribution,  such eligible distributee may request that, in lieu of payment to the eligible distributee, all or part of such payment or payments be rolled over directly from the Trustee to the trustee of
an  eligible retirement plan.  Any such request shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator or its delegate, subject to such requirements and restrictions as may be prescribed by applicable Treasury
regulations. For purposes of this Section 5.10:      (a)  eligible distributee  shall include the
Participant, his Spouse or his alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code or, effective January 1, 2008, the Participant s beneficiary who is not the Participant s
Spouse;      (b)  eligible rollover distribution  shall mean a distribution from the Plan, excluding
(i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) over the life (or life expectancy) of the eligible distributee, the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the
eligible distributee and eligible distributee s designated beneficiary, or a specified period of ten (10) or more years, and (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code;
and      (c)  eligible retirement plan  shall mean (i) an individual retirement account described in
Section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) a qualified plan the terms of which permit
the acceptance of rollover distributions, (v) an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(i)(A) of the Code that shall
separately account for the distribution, (vi) an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or (vii) an individual retirement plan described in Section 408A(b) of the Code; provided, however, that (x) with
respect to a plan described in clause (vii), for transfers occurring before January 1, 2010, the eligible distributee meets the requirements of Section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (y) with respect to a distribution (or portion of a
distribution) to a person who is not the Participant or the surviving Spouse of the Participant,  eligible retirement plan  shall mean only a plan described in clause (i) or (ii) or, effective January 1, 2010, clause (vii),
that, in either case, is established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person.       

ARTICLE VI.  
  Breaks in Service.        6.1 Whenever
used in this Article:   
         58   

(a)  One-Year Break in Service  means a calendar year in which an
Employee completes 500 or fewer Hours of Service.      (b)  Reemployment Date  means the first day on
which an Employee who has had a Separation from Service completes an Hour of Service in a calendar year that is not a One-Year Break in Service.      (c)  Reemployment Eligibility Computation Period  means an Eligibility Computation Period determined as if the Employee s Employment Date were his Reemployment Date.   
  6.2 If an Employee has a Separation from Service before he has met the requirements for retirement under Sections 4.1-4.3 or for a
deferred annuity under Section 4.4, he shall be deemed to have received a distribution of his entire nonforfeitable Accrued Benefit of zero dollars upon such Separation from Service and his Eligibility Years, Accrued Benefit, Benefit Years, and
Vesting Years shall be canceled.      6.3 If an Employee completes at least 1000 Hours of Service in a Reemployment Eligibility
Computation Period he shall be credited with an Eligibility Year.      6.4 (a) The Eligibility Years of an Employee whose
Eligibility Years have been canceled shall be restored if:      (1) he is credited with an Eligibility Year with
respect to a Reemployment Eligibility Computation Period that begins on or after his Reemployment Date; and   
  (2) he again becomes an Employee at a time when the number of consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service he has incurred is
less than the greater of five or the number of Eligibility Years the Employee had to his credit on account of his employment prior to the first One-Year Break in Service.   
  (b) If a former Employee whose Eligibility Years were not canceled under Section 6.2 or are restored under this
Section becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall become an Active Participant as of the later of the day he so becomes an Eligible Employee or the day he would have become an Active Participant under Article II if he had been an Eligible Employee at
all times since his prior Separation from Service. If a former Employee whose Eligibility Years were canceled under Section 6.2 and are not restored under this Section becomes an Eligible Employee, he shall become an Active Participant as
provided in Article II, except that his Reemployment Date shall be treated as his Employment Date.      6.5 The Benefit Years and
Accrued Benefit of an Employee whose Benefit Years have been canceled shall be restored upon his reemployment if his Eligibility Years are restored under Section 6.4. If a Participant s Benefit Years and Accrued Benefit were not canceled
pursuant to Section 6.2 upon his prior Separation from Service, his Benefit Years earned prior to his Separation from Service shall be aggregated with his Benefit Years earned   
         59   

after his Reemployment Date for purposes of determining the Participant s Accrued Benefit; provided, however, that:   
  (a) if the Participant previously received a single-sum distribution under Section 5.6 on or before the close of the
second Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant s Separation from Service occurred, the Participant s Benefit Years earned prior to his Separation from Service shall be disregarded upon his reemployment; or   
  (b) if the Participant received a single-sum distribution under Section 5.6 on a date later than that described in
Paragraph (a), the Participant s Accrued Benefit determined on and after his reemployment shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the distribution received by the Participant under Section 5.6 upon his prior Separation from
Service.      6.6 The Vesting Years of an Employee whose Vesting Years have been canceled shall be restored if:   
  (a) he is credited with a Vesting Year after his Reemployment Date; and   
  (b) he again becomes an Employee at a time when the number of consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service he has incurred is
less than the greater of five or the number of Vesting Years the Employee had to his credit on account of his employment prior to the first One-Year Break in Service.      6.7 Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, effective January 1, 1996, an Employee who was transferred to COPCO and whose benefits were transferred from the Plan in connection with
the sale of COPCO shall receive, upon such Employee s Reemployment Date, credit for years of service with the Company prior to such transfer for purposes of calculating Eligibility Years and Vesting Years (but not Benefit Years).   

ARTICLE VII.  
  Contributions.        7.1
Contributions by the Company. The Company shall contribute each year an amount actuarially determined to be sufficient to provide the benefits under the Plan. All Company contributions to the Plan are conditioned upon their deductibility for Federal
income tax purposes. The Company reserves the right, however, to reduce, suspend or discontinue its contributions under the Plan for any reason at any time. Except as provided in this Section or Section 9.2, it shall be impossible for any part
of the Company s contributions to revert to the Company, or to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants, annuitants and their beneficiaries. In the case of a contribution (a) made by the
Company as a mistake of fact, or (b) for which a tax deduction is disallowed, in whole or in part, by the Internal Revenue Service, the Company shall receive a refund of said contribution within one year after payment of a contribution as a
mistake of fact, or within one year after disallowance of a tax deduction, to the extent of such disallowance, as the case may be.   
         60   

7.2 Source of Benefits. All benefits under the Plan shall be paid exclusively from the
Fund, and the Company shall have no duty to contribute thereto except as provided in this Article.       

ARTICLE VIII.  
  Administration.        8.1 The
Administrator. (a)  In General . The Company s Vice President, Compensation   Benefits, or such other person or committee appointed by the Chief Human Resources Officer from time to time (such vice president or other person
or committee, the  Administrator ), shall be the  administrator  of the Plan, within the meaning of such term as used in ERISA. In addition, the Administrator shall be the  named fiduciary  of the Plan, within the
meaning of such term as used in ERISA, solely with respect to administrative matters involving the Plan and not with respect to any investment of the Plan s assets. The Administrator shall have the following duties, responsibilities and rights:
     (i) The Administrator shall have the duty and discretionary authority to interpret and construe this Plan in
regard to all questions of eligibility, the status and rights of Participants, Retirees, Beneficiaries and other persons under this Plan, and the manner, time, and amount of payment of any distributions under this Plan. The determination of the
Administrator with respect to an Employee s years of Credited Service, the amount of the Employee s Earnings, Highest Average Annual Pay, Federal Benefit and any other matter affecting payments under the Plan shall be final and binding.
Benefits under the Plan shall be paid to a Participant or Beneficiary only if the Administrator, in his discretion, determines that such person is entitled to benefits.   
  (ii) Each Employer shall, from time to time, upon request of the Administrator, furnish to the Administrator such data and
information as the Administrator shall require in the performance of his duties.      (iii) The Administrator shall
direct the Trustee to make payments of amounts to be distributed from the Trust under Article 6 (relating to Service Annuity forms). In addition, it shall be the duty of the Administrator to certify to the Trustee the names and addresses of all
Retirees, the amounts of all Service Annuities, the dates of death of Retirees and all proceedings and acts of the Administrator necessary or desirable for the Trustee to be fully informed as to the Service Annuities to be paid out of the Trust.
     (iv) The Administrator shall have all powers and responsibilities necessary to administer the Plan, except
those powers that are specifically vested in the Investment Fiduciary, the Corporate Investment Committee or the Trustee.      (v) The Administrator may require a Participant or Beneficiary to complete and file certain applications or forms approved by the Administrator and to furnish such information requested by the
Administrator. The Administrator and the Plan may rely upon all such information so furnished to the Administrator.   
         61   

(vi) The Administrator shall be the Plan s agent for service of legal
process and forward all necessary communications to the Trustee.      (b)  Removal of Administrator . The Chief Human
Resources Officer shall have the right at any time, with or without cause, to remove the Administrator (including any member of a committee that constitutes the Administrator). The Administrator may resign and the resignation shall be effective upon
delivery of the written resignation to the Chief Human Resources Officer. Upon the resignation, removal or failure or inability for any reason of the Administrator to act hereunder, the Chief Human Resources Officer shall appoint a successor. Any
successor Administrator shall have all the rights, privileges and duties of the predecessor, but shall not be held accountable for the acts of the predecessor. None of the Company, any member of the board of directors of the Company who is not the
Chief Human Resources Officer, nor any other person shall have any responsibility regarding the retention or removal of the Administrator.      8.2 The Investment Fiduciary. The Company, acting through the Exelon Investment Office, shall be the Investment Fiduciary and the  named fiduciary  of the Plan, within the meaning of such term
as used in ERISA, solely with respect to matters involving the investment of assets of the Plan and, any contrary provision of the Plan notwithstanding, in all events subject to the limitations contained in Section 404(a)(2) of ERISA and all

Investment Committee. The Administrator, any person acting as, or on behalf of, the Investment Fiduciary, and any member of the Corporate Investment Committee may, but need not, be an Employee, trustee or officer of an Employer and such status shall
not disqualify such person from taking any action hereunder or render such person accountable for any distribution or other material advantage received by him under this Plan, provided that no Administrator, person acting as, or on behalf of, the
Investment Fiduciary, or any member of the Corporate Investment Committee who is a Participant shall take part in any action of the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary on any matter involving solely his rights under this Plan.

Chief Human Resources Officer, and the directors, officers and employees of the Employers and each of them, from the effects and consequences of their acts, omissions and conduct in their official capacity with respect to the Plan (including but not
limited to judgments, attorney fees and costs with respect to any and all related claims, subject to the Company s notice of and right to direct any litigation, select any counsel or advisor, and approve any settlement), except to the extent
that such effects and consequences result from their own willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification shall be in addition to (and secondary to) such other rights such persons may enjoy as a matter of law or by reason of insurance coverage of
any kind.      8.9 No Compensation. None of the Administrator, any person employed in the Exelon Investment Office nor any member
of the Corporate Investment Committee may receive any compensation or fee from the Plan for services as the Administrator, Investment Fiduciary or a member of the Corporate Investment Committee; provided, however that nothing contained herein shall
preclude the Plan from reimbursing the Company or any Affiliate for compensation paid to any such person if such compensation constitutes  direct expenses  for purposes of ERISA. The Employers shall reimburse the Administrator, the persons
employed in the Exelon Investment Office and the members of the Corporate Investment Committee for any reasonable expenditures incurred in the discharge of their duties hereunder.

Administrator (or its delegate) shall review the claim and, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, within 90 days after receipt of the claim, give notice to the claimant, either in writing by registered or certified mail or in an

an extension of   
         64   

time and the date by which it is expected that the benefit determination will be rendered. The notice of the decision with respect to the claim shall be written in a manner calculated to be

review of the adverse benefit determination shall be made by the Administrator (or its delegate) within, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, 60 days after receipt of such request, and the claimant shall be given written notice
of the final decision. If it is determined that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 60-day period and in no event shall such an extension exceed
60 days. The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the determination on review is expected to be rendered. The review shall take into account all comments, documents, records
and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The notice of the final decision shall include specific reasons for

  8.12 Actuary to Be Employed. The Company or the Investment Fiduciary shall engage an actuary to do such technical and advisory work as
the Company or the Investment Fiduciary may request, including analyses of the experience of this Plan from time to time, the preparation of actuarial tables for the making of computations thereunder, and the submission to the Company or the

the address last appearing on the records of the Administrator.      8.15 Notices to Employers or Administrator. Written

Each person entitled to receive a payment under this Plan shall file with the Administrator in writing such person s complete mailing
address and each change therein. A check or communication mailed to any person at such person s address on file with the Administrator shall be deemed to have been received by such person for all purposes of this Plan. Although neither the
Administrator nor the Trustee shall be obliged to search for or ascertain the location of any person, the Administrator shall make reasonable efforts to locate any missing Participant or Beneficiary entitled to benefits hereunder. If the
Administrator is in doubt as to whether payments are being received by the person entitled thereto, it shall, by registered mail addressed to the person concerned at his last address known to the Administrator, notify such person that all future
payments will be withheld until such person submits to the Administrator evidence of his continued life and proper mailing address.      8.18 Electronic Media. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary and for all purposes of the Plan, to the extent permitted by the Administrator and any applicable law or Regulation, the
use of electronic technologies shall be deemed to satisfy any written notice, consent, delivery, signature, disclosure or recordkeeping requirement under the Plan, the Code or ERISA to the extent permitted by or consistent with applicable law and
Regulations. Any transmittal by electronic technology shall be deemed delivered when successfully sent to the recipient, or such other time specified by the Administrator.      8.19 Correction of Error. If it comes to the attention of the Administrator that an error has been made in the amount of benefits payable, or paid, to any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, the
Administrator shall be permitted to correct such error by whatever means that the Administrator, in its sole discretion determines, including by offsetting future benefits payable to the Participant or Beneficiary or requiring repayment of benefits
to the Plan, except that no adjustment need be made with respect to any Participant or Beneficiary whose benefit has been distributed in full prior to the discovery of such error.   
         66   

8.20 Applicable Law. Except to the extent preempted by applicable federal law or otherwise
provided under the terms of the Plan, the Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.      8.21 Statute of Limitations for Actions under the Plan. Except for actions to which the statute of limitations prescribed by Section 413 of ERISA applies, (a) no legal or equitable action
relating to a claim for benefits under Section 502 of ERISA may be commenced later than one year after the claimant receives a final decision from the Chief Human Resources Officer (or such other officer designated from time to time by the
Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the
person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be interpreted to extend any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from
recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal or equitable action against any party.      8.22 Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan. Any legal action involving the Plan that is brought by any Participant, any Beneficiary or any other person shall be litigated in the federal courts located in
the Northern District of Illinois or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whichever is most convenient, and no other federal or state court.      8.23 Legal Fees. Any award of legal fees in connection with an action involving the Plan shall be calculated pursuant to a method that results in the lowest amount of fees being paid, which amount shall
be no more than the amount that is reasonable. In no event shall legal fees be awarded for work related to (a) administrative proceedings under the Plan, (b) unsuccessful claims brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person, or
(c) actions that are not brought under ERISA. In calculating any award of legal fees, there shall be no enhancement for the risk of contingency, nonpayment or any other risk nor shall there be applied a contingency multiplier or any other
multiplier. In any action brought by a Participant, Beneficiary or any other person against the Plan, the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary, the Corporate Investment Committee, any Plan fiduciary, the Chief Human Resources Officer, any Plan
administrator, the Company, its affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents (the  Plan Parties ), legal fees of the Plan Parties in connection with such action shall be paid by the Participant, Beneficiary or
other person bringing the action, unless the court specifically finds that there was a reasonable basis for the action.       

ARTICLE IX.  
  Amendment and Termination.        9.1
Amendment. Exelon Corporation may amend the Plan at any time for any reason. Each amendment to the Plan shall be adopted by Exelon Corporation s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof); provided, however, that in the case of any amendment
or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the
case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or
  
         67   

greater responsibility. If an amendment changes the vesting provisions of the Plan, any person who is a Participant on the later of the date the amendment is adopted or becomes effective shall
have at all times a vested interest in his Accrued Benefit as of that date determined without regard to the amendment. In addition, within a reasonable period determined by the Exelon Corporation in accordance with regulations issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury, any Participant who has at least three Vesting Years to his credit on the last day of the election period may elect to have his vested interest in his entire Accrued Benefit determined without regard to the amendment.
Except as otherwise permitted by law, no amendment shall reduce a Participant s Accrued Benefit nor result in the elimination or reduction of a benefit  protected  under Section 411(d)(6) of the Code.   
  9.2 Termination. Exelon Corporation may terminate or partially terminate the Plan through resolutions adopted by Exelon
Corporation s Board of Directors. If the Plan is terminated or partially terminated, the assets of the Plan shall be allocated, subject to Section 9.3, as provided in Section 4044 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(as it may be from time to time amended or construed by any appropriate governmental agency or corporation), without subclasses. Any amount remaining after all fixed and contingent liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied shall be returned to
Exelon Corporation. Allocations under this Section shall be nonforfeitable. Except as otherwise required by law, the time and manner of distribution of the assets shall be determined by Exelon Corporation by amendment to the Plan pursuant to
Section 9.1.      9.3 Limitation on Benefits. The following provisions shall be effective with respect to distributions made
on or after May 14, 1990; distributions made prior to May 14, 1990 shall be subject to the restrictions described in Treas. Reg.  1.401-4(c).      (a) In the event of Plan termination, the benefit payable to any Highly Compensated Employee shall be limited to a benefit that is nondiscriminatory under Section 401(a)(4) of the Code. If payment of
benefits is restricted in accordance with this Paragraph (a), assets in excess of the amount required to provided such restricted benefits shall become a part of the assets available under Section 9.2 for allocation among Participants and
beneficiaries of Participants whose benefits are not restricted under this Paragraph (a).      (b) The restrictions
of this Paragraph (b) shall apply prior to termination of the Plan to any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee and who is one of the 25 highest paid employees or former employees of the Company and all Affiliates for any Plan Year.
The annual payments made from the Plan on behalf of any such Participant shall be limited to an amount equal to (1) the payments that would have been made under a single life annuity that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the sum of the
Participant s Accrued Benefit and any other benefits under the Plan (other than a social security supplement) and (2) the payments that the Participant is entitled to receive under a social security supplement.   
  (c) The restrictions in Paragraph (b) shall not apply:   
         68   

(1) if, after the payment of benefits to or on behalf of such Participant,
the value of the Plan assets equals or exceeds 110 percent of the value of the current liabilities (within the meaning of Section 412(l)(7) of the Code);      (2) if the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Participant is less than one percent (1%) of the value of current liabilities before distribution; or   
  (3) if the value of the benefits payable to or on behalf of the Participant does not exceed $5,000.   

ARTICLE X.  
  Miscellaneous.        10.1
Forfeitures. All forfeitures arising under the Plan shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the Company s contributions and shall not be applied to increase the benefits any person would otherwise receive under the Plan.   
  10.2 Mergers, Etc. No merger or consolidation with, or transfer of any of the Plan s assets or liabilities to, any other plan shall
occur at any time unless each Participant and annuitant would (if the Plan had then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to
receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated).      10.3 Nonalienation of
Benefits. Except (a) to the extent permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (b) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (c) to the extent required to satisfy a Federal tax levy made pursuant to
Section 6331 of the Code, or (d) effective as of January 1, 1997, pursuant to Section 401(a)(13) of the Code, to the extent a judgment relates to the Participant s conviction of a crime involving the Plan, or a judgment,
order, decree or settlement agreement between the Participant and the Secretary of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relates to a violation of part 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, no benefit under this Plan may be voluntarily or
involuntarily assigned or alienated. Notwithstanding the above, a Participant may authorize the Administrator to deduct from benefit payments under the Plan up to 10% of each such payment as contributions to a Company political action committee. Any
such authorization shall be revocable by the Participant at any time.      10.4 Effect on Employment. This Plan shall not confer
upon any person any right to be continued in the employment of the Company.      10.5 Facility of Payment. If the Company deems
any person incapable of receiving benefits to which he is entitled by reason of minority, illness, infirmity, or other incapacity, it may direct that payment be made directly for the benefit of such person or to any person selected by the Company to
disburse it, whose receipt shall be a complete acquittance therefor. Such payments shall, to the extent thereof, discharge all liability of the Company and the party making the payment.   
         69   

10.6 Lost Payees. If a Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary to whom a benefit is
payable under the Plan cannot be located following a reasonable effort to do so by the Administrator, such benefit shall be forfeited. Whether or not efforts to locate a Participant have previously been made, the Administrator shall make reasonable
efforts to locate the Participant (or the Spouse of a deceased Participant) during the one-year period preceding the Participant s Required Beginning Date. If such efforts fail to locate the Participant or Spouse, such Participant or Spouse
shall be presumed dead as of the Required Beginning Date and any benefit payable to the Participant or Spouse shall be forfeited. In any case, if a claim for a forfeited benefit is subsequently filed by the Participant, Spouse or beneficiary, such
benefit shall be reinstated and paid in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Plan.      10.7 Effective Date. The
provisions of this instrument apply only to individuals who complete an Hour of Service on or after the effective date stated under the title of the Plan on page one. The eligibility and benefits of any other person shall be determined under the

and the Corporate Investment Committee, the fees of counsel and any agents for the Trustee, the Administrator, the Investment Fiduciary or the Corporate Investment Committee, and the fees of investment managers that manage assets of the Trust shall
be paid by the Trustee from the Trust in such proportion as the Investment Fiduciary, in its sole discretion, shall determine, to the extent such expenses are not paid by the Employers and to the extent permitted under ERISA, Regulations and other
applicable laws. Any such expenses that are borne by the Employers shall be paid out of their own funds in such proportions as the Administrator shall determine. In the event that the Company or any other Employer advances money on behalf of the
Trust for the payment of any expenses incurred in the operation of the Plan, the Trustee shall reimburse the Company or such other Employer from the Trust for any amount so advanced, without interest or fees.   

ARTICLE XI.  
  Top-Heavy Provisions.        11.1
Definitions. Whenever used in this Article:       Determination Date  means, with respect to any Plan Year, the last day
of the preceding Plan Year.   
         70   

Key Employee  means any Participant who, at any time during the Plan Year or any
of the four preceding Plan Years, is an individual described in Section 416(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.   
   Permissive Aggregation Group  means a group of qualified retirement plans maintained by the Company or any Affiliate, which
group consists of the Required Aggregation group and any other plan or plans which, considered together with the Required Aggregation Group, meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.   
   Required Aggregation Group  means the group of qualified retirement plans maintained by the Company or an Affiliate, including
a frozen plan or a plan that has been terminated during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, which group consists of this Plan, each other plan in which a Key Employee is a participant (or, in the case of a terminated plan was a
participant in such five-year period) and each other plan that enables any such plan to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code, but only if such group includes this Plan. Otherwise, the Required Aggregation Group consists
of this Plan only.       Top-Heavy Plan Year  means a Plan Year that begins after December 31, 1983, in which the
Plan is top-heavy. The Plan is top-heavy for a given Plan Year if for that Plan Year (1) the Required Aggregation Group is top-heavy, and (2) the Required Aggregation Group is not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group that is not
top-heavy. The Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group (the  Group ) is top-heavy for a given Plan Year if the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits (or, the aggregate of the accounts, in the case of a
defined contribution plan included in such Group) of participants who are Key Employees exceeds 60% of the like amount determined for all participants in all plans included in such Group. For purposes of this definition:   
  (a) the present value of the accrued benefit or the account of any participant shall be increased by the amount of all
plan distributions to such participant during the five year period ending on the Determination Date; provided that no such increase shall arise from any rollover contribution or plan-to-plan transfer from this Plan that is not initiated by the
participant or is made to another plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliate;      (b) the present value of the
accrued benefit or the account of a participant who has been a Key Employee but no longer is a Key Employee shall not be taken into account;      (c) the present value of the accrued benefit or the account of any Participant who has not performed services for the Company or an Affiliate at any time during the five-year period that ends on the
Determination Date shall not be taken into account;      (d) any rollover contribution or plan-to-plan transfer to
this Plan that is initiated by a participant and made from a plan that is not maintained by the Company or an Affiliate after December 31, 1983 shall not be taken into account; and   
         71   

(e) the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined, effective
January 1, 1987, under the method used for accrual purposes for all plans maintained by the Company and all Affiliates if a single method is used by all such plans, or, otherwise, the slowest accrual method permitted under
Section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.      11.2 Top-Heavy Operating Rules. Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding,
the following rules shall apply in a Top-Heavy Plan Year:      (a) For purposes of determining benefits under this
Article XI,  compensation  shall mean compensation as reported on Forms W-2 by the Company or any Affiliate for such Plan Year and the maximum amount of compensation of any Participant who is an Employee during such Plan Year shall be
$150,000, or such other amount as may apply to such Participant pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder.      (b) For purposes of determining the maximum annuity in Section 4.6 for Plan years beginning before January 1, 2000,  1.0  shall be substituted for  1.25 , wherever it
appears.      (c) The Accrued Benefit which each Participant who is an Employee but not a Key Employee under this
Plan derives from contributions by the Company shall be increased by the amount necessary to cause the Accrued Benefits payable to each Participant in such year, when expressed as a benefit payable annually in the form of a Single Life Annuity, to
equal at least the required minimum benefit, where the required minimum benefit is the product of:      (1) the
average of the Participant s compensation for the five consecutive Plan Years that yield the highest average, disregarding Plan Years which begin before January 1, 1984, and Plan Years which are not Top-Heavy Plan Years, and   
  (2) the lesser of:      (A) 2 percent multiplied by the number of Vesting Years with the Company which were also Top-Heavy Plan Years and which were completed after January 1, 1984; or   
  (B) 20 percent.   
  For purposes of determining whether an increase in benefit accrual is required, all plans included in the Required Aggregation Group shall be treated as
one plan.      (d) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in any Top-Heavy Plan Year, a Participant
who does not otherwise have a nonforfeitable right to 100% of his Accrued Benefit shall have a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of his Accrued Benefit in accordance with the following schedule:   
         72   

In any Plan Year
following the last Top-Heavy Plan Year, any Employee who is a Participant on the last day of the last Top-Heavy Plan Year shall have at all times a vested interest in his Accrued Benefit as of that date determined under the schedule set forth above.
In addition, within a reasonable period determined by the Company, any Participant who has at least three Vesting Years to his credit on that date may elect to have his vested interest in his entire Accrued Benefit determined under the schedule set

ARTICLE XII.  
  Post Retirement Health Benefits.     
  12.1 Eligibility      (a) Effective December 1, 1994, post-retirement health befits may be paid under this Article, to the extent the Company elects to fund benefits under this Article, to any Participant, who is
receiving or has received pension benefits under this Plan, and if applicable, to the Spouse or dependents of such Participant; provided, however, that the Company may, in its discretion, decide not to provide post-retirement health benefits under
this Article for Key Employees (as defined in Section 11.1) and, if applicable, their Spouses and dependents.      (b) In addition to satisfying the requirements of Subsection (a), any person claiming post-retirement health benefits under this Plan must meet all applicable requirements imposed in the post-retirement
health plans maintained by the Company. All determinations of benefit levels and eligibility for benefits shall be made pursuant to the terms of such post-retirement health plans.   
  (c) The establishment of an account under this Article XII to provide payment for post-retirement health benefits shall
not obligate the Company to maintain its post-retirement health plans, and the Company shall retain the same ability to amend or terminate such post-retirement health plans as if this Article XII did not exist.   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, post-retirement health benefits shall not be available for any Power Team Employee.   
  12.2 Benefits Provided.      (a) Benefits under this Article shall include all health benefits provided by the post-retirement health plans maintained by the Company, including payment of Medicare Part B premiums to the extent
provided by such post-retirement health plans, to the extent such benefits are not otherwise provided by the Company.   
         73   

(b) Benefits under this Article shall be provided using any method or
combination of methods as the Company shall deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, purchase of insurance and the payment of premiums for such insurance, direct reimbursement of costs incurred by the provider of such benefits or
reimbursement to the individual to whom such benefits were provided.      (c) Benefits and coverage under this
Article shall not be discriminatory in favor of officers, shareholders, supervisory employees or highly compensated employees.   
  12.3 Establishment of Accounts.      (a) A separate account shall be maintained with respect to the contributions to fund benefits under this Article. This account is to be maintained for accounting purposes only. Funds accounted for in such
account may be invested on a commingled basis with pension benefit contributions under this Plan without identification of which investments are allocable to each account, provided that earnings on all Plan assets are allocated in a reasonable
manner.      (b) If the Company elects to fund post-retirement health benefits for Key Employees under this
Article, as separate account shall be maintained for post-retirement health benefits payable to each Key Employee, his Spouse and dependents. Benefits under this Article shall be payable to such Key Employee, Spouse and dependents only from such
account. The separate account maintained under this Subsection (b) shall be a true separate account, and not maintained merely for accounting purposes. Commingling of assets held in such account with any other Plan assets is not permitted. For
purposes of Section 415 of the Code contributions allocated to any separate account under this Subsection (b) shall be treated as an annual addition to a defined contribution plan.   
  12.4 Funding.      (a) Contributions to provide benefits under this Article may be contributory or non-contributory, in accordance with the terms of the post-retirement health plans maintained by the Company.   
  (b) Amounts contributed to fund post-retirement health benefits shall be reasonable and ascertainable. The total amount
contributed to fund post-retirement health benefits under this Article shall not exceed the cost of providing such benefits. The total cost of providing such benefits shall be determined in accordance with a generally accepted actuarial method
selected by the Company which is reasonable in view of the provisions and coverage of the Plan, the funding medium and other relevant considerations, including, but not limited to, applicable Treasury regulations. For purposes of determining the
cost of providing post-retirement health benefits, the actuarial method may take into account reasonable projected increases in the cost of providing health benefits. Forfeitures, if any, under this Article shall be applied as soon as possible to
reduce employer contributions to fund benefits under this Article.      (c) Post-retirement health benefits
provided under this Article, when added to life insurance protection provided under the Plan, shall be incidental and   
         74   

subordinate to pension benefits provided under the Plan. For purposes of this Article, post-retirement health benefits shall be considered incidental and subordinate if the aggregate of the
contributions for post-retirement health benefits provided under this Article plus the contributions for life insurance protection under this Plan does not exceed 25 percent of the total contributions to the Plan (other than for past service credit)
made on or after December 1, 1994.      (d) Until the satisfaction of all liabilities to be provided under
this Article, neither amounts contributed to fund post-retirement health benefits under this Article nor earnings thereon shall be used for or diverted to any purpose other than providing such benefits or payment of necessary or appropriate expenses
attributable to the administration of post-retirement health accounts under this Article. Any amounts contributed to fund medical benefits under this Article remaining in a post-retirement health account after the satisfaction of all liabilities
arising under this Article must be returned to the Company.      (e) Nothing in this Article shall obligate the
Company to pay benefits described in Section 12.2 to the extent those benefits exceed assets contributed to the Fund to provide post-retirement health benefits under this Article. Furthermore, nothing in this Article shall imply that amounts
contributed to the Fund to provide pension or other benefits (other than post-retirement health benefits) available under the Plan will be used to provide post-retirement health benefits under this Article. The Company may, in its discretion, fund
all or any part of the benefits described in Section 12.2 from other sources or may pay such benefits out of its general assets as the benefits become payable.   
  (f) If in any proceeding subsequent to December 1, 1994, under Section 1308 of the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Code, the Company is not permitted to fully recover in rates the contributions made to the separate account maintained to fund benefits under this Article, the Company, at its discretion, may elect to defer or discontinue funding the benefits under
this Article.   
         75   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly
authorized officer on this                day of December, 2010.

SERVICE ANNUITY PLAN   
  APPENDIX A   
  Actuarial equivalence under this Plan shall mean a benefit of equivalent value when computed using a 7% interest rate and the mortality
tables attached to the Plan as Exhibit A (for pensioners) and B (for beneficiaries, if applicable), with such exceptions as specifically set forth in the Plan.      For distributions on or after January 1, 2008, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 shall be determined by using (i) the
interest rate as defined in Section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the second month preceding the calendar year in which such distribution is made or commences and (ii) the mortality table specified by the Commissioner of the Internal
Revenue Service for purposes of Section 417(e)(3) of the Code as in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Benefit Commencement Date occurs.      For distributions on or after January 1, 2000 and on or before December 31, 2007, the lump sum Actuarial Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 shall
be determined using the annual rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities as specified by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 417(e)(3)(A) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder for the second full
calendar month preceding the first day of the Plan Year containing the date of distribution, and the mortality table shall be the mortality table prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 417(e)(3)(A) of the
Code on the date as of which the single sum payment is being determined, if the use of such assumptions would result in a greater benefit.      For the period beginning on or after January 1, 2000, and ending on or before December 31, 2001, and ending on the date of adoption of this amendment and restatement, the lump sum Actuarial
Equivalent of a Participant s Accrued Benefit for purposes of Section 5.6 shall be determined on the basis of the assumptions which would be used as of the first day of the Plan Year containing the date of distribution by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation for purposes of determining the present value of a lump sum distribution upon plan termination, if the use of such assumptions would result in a greater benefit.

 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors 

Exhibit 10.3        Exelon Corporation        Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors
       (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2011)    
  The purpose of this Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the  Plan ) is to permit Directors of Exelon Corporation
( Exelon ) to elect to defer receipt of directors  fees. The Plan as set forth herein is an amendment and restatement of the Plan as originally adopted effective October 20, 2000 and previously amended and restated as of
January 1, 2009, and is a successor to the PECO Energy Company Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the  Prior Plan ).      1.  Administration . The Plan shall be administered by the Corporate Secretary of Exelon or his or her designee (the  Secretary ), or such other individual or individuals as designated by
the Board of Directors of Exelon (the  Exelon Board ). The Secretary shall interpret the Plan and establish such rules and regulations of plan administration that he or she deems appropriate. The cost of plan administration shall be paid
by Exelon and its participating subsidiaries, and shall not be charged against the deferred accounts of Plan participants.      2.
 Eligibility . All Directors of Exelon (other than full-time employees of Exelon or its subsidiaries) shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Effective as of January 1, 2011, all Directors of Commonwealth Edison Company
( ComEd ) and PECO Energy Company ( PECO ) who are not full-time employees of Exelon or its subsidiaries shall also be eligible to participate in the Plan.      3.  Deferrals . (a) Prior to the first day of each calendar year, each eligible Director may elect in writing to defer the receipt of all or a portion of his or her directors  fees earned
with respect to his or her service on the board of directors of Exelon, ComEd and/or   

PECO (each such board of directors, a  Board ) for such calendar year, by filing a written Director s deferral agreement form with the Secretary with respect to each such Board on
which the Director serves. A Director who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after the first day of any calendar year shall be permitted to make the election described in this Section 3 not later than 30 days after becoming
eligible to participate in the Plan, and such election shall apply only to directors  fees earned during the remainder of such calendar year. In all events, each deferral election made under this Plan shall apply only to fees earned after the
date of such election. Deferred amounts under the Plan, together with deferred amounts and attributable earnings under the Prior Plan, shall be credited to a deferral account in the participant s name ( Deferral Account ) for later
distribution. Each participant s Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping entry only, and none of Exelon, ComEd or PECO shall be required to fund the Deferral Account. Any assets that may be held to fund a Deferral Account shall at all times
remain unrestricted assets of Exelon, ComEd or PECO in its corporate capacity and not as a fiduciary, and shall be subject to the claims of its general creditors. Pending distribution, each participant s Deferral Account shall be credited with
earnings or interest as provided in Section 3(b).      (b) (1) For purposes of measuring the earnings or losses credited to
a participant s Deferral Account, the participant may select, from among the investment funds available from time to time under the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the  Savings Plan ), the investment funds in which all or
part of his or her Deferral Account shall be deemed to be invested.      (2) The participant shall make an investment designation
in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary, which shall remain effective until another valid   
         -2-

designation has been made by the participant as herein provided. The Secretary may, but need not, permit separate investment designations with respect to amounts attributable to fees earned with
respect to service on each Board. The participant may amend his or her investment designation at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the Secretary. A timely change to the participant s investment designation shall become effective as
soon as administratively practicable after such designation is submitted.      (3) The investment funds deemed to be made
available to the participant, and any limitation on the maximum or minimum percentages of the participant s Deferral Account that may be deemed to be invested in any particular fund, shall be the same as available or in effect from time to time
under the Savings Plan.      (4) Except as provided below, the participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to be invested
in accordance with his or her investment designations, and the Deferral Account shall be credited with earnings (or losses) as if invested as directed by the participant.      To the extent that the participant does not furnish complete investment instructions, then the Deferral Account shall be deemed invested in the default investment fund then in effect under the Savings
Plan. The Deferral Accounts maintained pursuant to the Plan are for bookkeeping purposes only and Exelon is under no obligation to invest such amounts.      Exelon shall provide a statement to each participant not less frequently than annually showing such information as is appropriate, including the aggregate amount in his or her Deferral Account, as of a
reasonably current date.      4.  Distributions . (a) The amount credited to a participant s Deferral Account with
respect to his or her participation on each Board shall be distributed to the participant in, or   
         -3-

beginning in, April of the first year beginning after the occurrence of one of the following distribution events, as the participant shall direct in his or her Benefit Distribution Election Form:
(i) the participant s separation from service, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), as a Director of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and their affiliates, (ii) the
participant s 65th birthday or (iii) the participant s 72   nd    birthday. Distributions shall be paid in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years, as the participant shall direct in his or her Benefit Distribution Election Form.
Each installment payment shall be determined by multiplying the balance remaining to the credit of the Deferral Account as of March 31 of such year (including earnings or interest credited under Section 3) by a fraction, the numerator of
which is  1  and the denominator of which is the number of years (including the current year) for which payments are yet to be made. Any unpaid balance in the Deferral Account shall be credited with earnings or interest as provided in
Section 3. In the event a Director who has elected a distribution event based on his or her 65   th    or 72   nd   
birthday continues to serve as a Director after the date such distributions commence, then in the year prior to the year in which such distributions commence such Director shall file a new Benefit Distribution Election Form governing any amounts
credited to his or her Deferral Account after the date such distributions commence. If the Director does not file such new Benefit Distribution Election Form, then the Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive a lump sum distribution of
any such amounts upon the Director s separation from service.      (b) Except as permitted under Section 4(c) or 4(d),
each Director must submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form for amounts attributable to fees earned with respect to service on a Board at the time such Director makes his or her initial deferral election under the Plan with respect to his or her
service on such Board (provided that a Director who participated in the Plan   
         -4-

prior to January 1, 2009 and had not commenced distributions must have submitted such form not later than December 31, 2008). If a Director does not submit a Benefit Distribution
Election Form during this period, then such Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive the portion of his or her Account attributable to fees earned for service on such Board in the form of installments payments over a period of ten years
upon the Director s separation from service.      (c) Notwithstanding Sections 4(a) and 4(b), each participant who had not
commenced and was not scheduled to commence the receipt of distributions under the Plan on or before December 31, 2007 was permitted to submit a Benefit Distribution Election Form on or before June 30, 2007 which provided for the payment
of such participant s Deferral Account (i) at any of the times and in any of the forms permitted under Section 4(a) of the Plan or (ii) in a lump sum payment in the first quarter of 2008; provided that such election did not cause
any payment to be made in 2007 and did not apply to any payment that otherwise would be paid in 2007. This special election right was intended to comply with the transition rule set forth in IRS Notice 2005-1, Q A-19(c), and extended in the
preamble to regulations proposed under Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2006-79, which permits participants in deferred compensation plans to change the date on which deferred compensation is payable.   
  (d) A Director may elect to change the time and/or method of his or her distributions payable under the Plan in accordance with
procedures prescribed by the Secretary; provided that, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, any such change in a distribution election (i) shall not be effective until 12 months after it is submitted to the Secretary,
(ii) must be submitted to the Secretary at least 12 months prior to the date on which such distributions were previously scheduled to commence and (iii) must provide for distributions to commence at least five years after the date on which
such distributions were previously scheduled to commence. No more than   
         -5-

one such election change shall be permissible with respect to the portion of a Director s account attributable to service with any Board.   
  5.  Death Benefits . Each participant shall designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any remaining amounts payable from
his or her Deferral Account after the participant s death. The beneficiaries, and any priority or allocation between them, shall be designated in the manner specified by the Secretary. If a participant dies before the entire balance in his or
her Deferral Account has been paid out, the remaining balance shall be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum upon the participant s death. If the participant is not survived by a designated beneficiary, the participant s beneficiary shall
be the participant s spouse, if living, or otherwise, the participant s estate. If a beneficiary survives the participant but dies before the entire balance payable to him or her has been distributed, any remaining balance shall be paid to
the beneficiary s estate in a lump sum. In the absence of contrary proof, the participant shall be deemed to have survived any designated beneficiary. A participant may change his or her beneficiary designation under this Section at any time
until his or her death by filing a written beneficiary designation with the Secretary, in the manner specified by the Secretary.      6.  Unforeseeable Financial Emergency . The Secretary may, in his or her discretion, direct that a participant be paid an amount in cash (not in excess of the balance of his or her Deferral Account)
sufficient to meet an unforeseeable emergency. An  unforeseeable emergency  means (i) a severe financial hardship to a Director resulting from an illness or accident of the Director, or the spouse or a dependent (as defined in
Section 152(a) of the Code) of the Director, (ii) the loss of a Director s property due to casualty or (iii) such other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
Director, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. A Director s written request for such a payment shall   
         -6-

describe the circumstances which the Director believes justify the payment and an estimate of the amount necessary to eliminate the unforeseeable emergency. An immediate payment to satisfy an
unforeseeable emergency will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the emergency need, plus an amount necessary to pay any taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such payment, and will not be made to the extent the need is or may be
relieved through reimbursement or compensation, by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Director s assets (to the extent such liquidation itself would not cause severe financial hardship). Any payment from a Director s Deferral
Account on account of an unforeseeable emergency shall be deemed to cancel any Deferral Election of the Director then in effect and the Director shall not be permitted to participate in the Plan until the next following calendar year.   
  7.  No Assignment or Alienation of Benefits . Except as hereinafter provided with respect to a domestic relations order, a
participant s Deferral Account may not be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or alienated. In cases of marital dispute, Exelon will observe the terms of the Plan unless and until ordered to do otherwise pursuant to a domestic relations
order, as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code. As a condition of participation, a participant agrees to hold Exelon harmless from any claim that arises out of Exelon s obeying the terms of a domestic relations order, whether such
order effects a judgment of such court or is issued to enforce a judgment or order of another court.      8.  Amendment or
Termination . The Plan may be altered, amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Exelon Board, provided that, except as otherwise provided herein or as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, no such action shall result in the
distribution of amounts credited to the Deferral Accounts of any participant in any manner other than is provided in the Plan, nor shall such action reduce the availability of amounts previously deferred. To the
  
         -7-

extent permitted by Section 409A, the Exelon Board may, in its discretion, terminate the Plan with respect to Exelon, ComEd and/or PECO and accelerate the payment of all Deferral Accounts to
the extent related to service on the Board for which the Plan is terminated:      (a) within 12 months of a corporate dissolution
taxed under Section 331 of the Code, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  503(b)(1)(A), provided that the payments with respect to each such Deferral Account are included in the Director s gross income in
the later of (i) the calendar year in which the Plan termination occurs or (ii) the first calendar year in which the payments are administratively practicable;      (b) in connection with a  change in control event,  as defined in, and to the extent permitted under, Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or   
  (c) upon any other termination event permitted under Section 409A of the Code.   
  9.  Compliance With Section 409A of the Code . The Plan is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code, and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. Exelon shall have the discretion and authority to amend the Plan at any time to satisfy any requirements of Section 409A of the Code or guidance provided by the U.S. Treasury Department
to the extent applicable to the Plan.      10.  Governing Law . The Plan shall be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to the extent not preempted by applicable federal law.

calendar year. The request shall be accompanied by the Participant s written statement that if such Excess Before-Tax Contributions are not distributed, such Excess Before-Tax Contributions, when added to amounts deferred under other plans or
arrangements described under sections 401(k), 408(k), or 403(b) of the Code, excluding any contributions which are Catch-Up Contributions described in section 414(v) of the Code, will exceed the limit for such Participant under section 402(g) of the
Code. A distribution of Excess Before-Tax Contributions (reduced by any amounts recharacterized or distributed pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of Section 4.4 (relating to adjustments to comply with section 401(k)(3) of the Code)) shall be made no
later than the applicable time period set forth in the Code and Regulations thereunder following the end of the Plan Year for which such Excess Before-Tax Contributions were made, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto through the end
of such Plan Year. The amount of any income or loss allocable to such Excess Before-Tax Contributions shall be determined pursuant to applicable Regulations. If Excess Before-Tax Contributions are distributed pursuant to this Section 4.2, any
corresponding Employer Matching Contributions allocated to the Participant s Employer Matching Contributions Account, adjusted for income or loss pursuant to Regulations, to which such Participant would be entitled under Section 8.3
(relating to distributions upon termination of employment) if such Participant had terminated employment on the last day of the calendar year during which contributions were made (or earlier if such Participant actually terminated employment at an
earlier date) shall be distributed to such Participant and any remaining amount of such corresponding Employer Matching Contributions, adjusted for income or loss, shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, any such Excess
Before-Tax Contributions shall be treated as  annual additions  for purposes of Section 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations   
         16   

imposed by section 415 of the Code) and shall not be disregarded as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining the average deferral percentage described in Section 4.4(d)(1) or, to
the extent applicable, the average contribution percentage described in Section 4.4(d)(2), except that in the case of a non-highly compensated eligible employee, as that term is defined in Section 4.4(d)(4), such Excess Before-Tax
Contributions shall be ignored to the extent that such contributions are prohibited pursuant to section 401(a)(30) of the Code, which requires that Before-Tax Contributions not exceed the limit described in paragraph (a) of Section 4.2
(relating to the annual limit on Before-Tax Contributions). Any distribution of Excess Before-Tax Contributions to a Participant shall be treated as a distribution of the Untaxed Contributions, up to the extent Untaxed Contributions have been made
by such Participant to the Plan for such Plan Year and, to the extent that distributions of Excess Before-Tax Contributions to such Participant exceed the Participant s Untaxed Contributions for such Plan Year, the distributions of Excess
Before-Tax Contributions shall be treated as Designated Roth Contributions made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year.      (c)  Untaxed Contributions and Designated Roth Contributions . Effective for Before-Tax Contributions made (i) in the case of a Participant who is not a Local 15 Member, for the 2006 Plan Year
and thereafter, and (ii) in the case of a Participant who is a Local 15 Member, for the 2009 Plan Year and thereafter, an election made by a Participant to commence, change, suspend or resume Before-Tax Contributions pursuant to this
Section 4.2 shall designate the portion of such contributions that are to be Designated Roth Contributions includible in the Participant s gross income when made pursuant to section 402A of the Code. Such designation is irrevocable with
respect to contributions made or to be made with respect to Compensation currently available. Any such election made by a Participant which does not expressly designate a portion of Before-Tax Contributions as Designated Roth Contributions shall be
deemed to   
         17   

designate no portion of Before-Tax Contributions as Designated Roth Contributions. Any Before-Tax Contributions that are not Designated Roth Contributions are referred to herein as Untaxed
Contributions.       Section 4.3 .  Employer Matching Contributions .   
  (a)  Amount of Contributions . Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.4 (relating to limitations on contributions for
highly compensated Eligible Employees), 4.5 (relating to the limitations on Employer contributions) and 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code), and except as otherwise provided below, each Employer shall
contribute the following for each payroll period on behalf of each Participant who is an Employee of such Employer:       

(i)  
  Effective beginning with the first payroll period in January 1, 2009, for each Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15,
an amount equal to 100 percent of Matched Contributions, as defined below, but only to the extent that Matched Contributions do not exceed 5 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period;     

(ii)  
  For each Participant who is covered under the collective bargaining agreement between Exelon Power Services LLC and Local 369 of the Utility Workers Union of America,
AFL-CIO, if such Participant has completed less than 5 months of service with an Employer, no contribution shall be made; if such Participant has completed more than 5 months of service but fewer than 12 months of service with an Employer, an amount
equal to 50% of Matched Contributions, as defined below, but only the extent that Matched Contributions do not exceed 3 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period; if such Participant has completed at least 12 months of
service with an Employer, an amount equal to 100% of Matched Contributions, but only to the extent that Matched Contributions do not exceed 3 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period. For purposes of this paragraph, a
month of service shall mean a consecutive period of employment during which the Employee is employed by an Employer ending on the monthly anniversary of the Employee s date of hire. A Participant who is credited with an additional month of
service during a pay period and becomes eligible to receive an increased Employer Matching Contribution, shall not be entitled to receive an increased Employer Matching Contribution until the first full payroll period following the payroll period in
which such Participant is credited with such additional month of service;     
         18   

(iii)  
  For each Participant who is classified as a non-exempt craft employee or clerical employee assigned to the Peachbottom, Limerick, Outage Services East or Texas
generating plant, an amount equal to 100 percent of Matched Contributions, as defined below, but only to the extent that Matched Contributions do not exceed 5 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period; and

(iv)  
  For each other Participant, an amount equal to 60 percent of Matched Contributions, as defined below, but only to the extent that Matched Contributions do not exceed 5
percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period.        In addition, each Participant described
in clause (iv) of the preceding paragraph shall be eligible to receive a  Profit Sharing Matching Contribution,  provided that such Participant either (i) is an Employee of such Employer on the last day of such Plan Year,
(ii) is not employed on such day as a result of an approved unpaid leave of absence during such Plan Year, (iii) terminates employment during such Plan Year (1) after attaining age 50 and completing at least 10 years of service, as
determined by the Administrator, (2) as a result of circumstances entitling the Participant to separation benefits under an Employer s severance benefit plan, (3) as a result of a disability that entitles the Participant to benefits
under an Employer s long-term disability plan, or (4) on account of the Participant s death. The  Profit Sharing Matching Contribution  shall be an amount (if any) determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (or the
Compensation Committee thereof) in its sole discretion based on attainment of specified performance goals, and not exceeding 60% of a Participant s Matched Contributions, as defined below, for each payroll period, but only to the extent that
such Matched Contributions do not exceed 5 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the payroll period.      For
purposes of this Section 4.3,  Matched Contributions  means the sum of (i) the Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of the Participant for a payroll period, excluding Before-Tax Contributions made with respect to any quarterly
incentive awards pursuant to   
         19   

paragraph (b) of Section 3.2, excluding Additional Before-Tax Contributions which are Catch-Up Contributions described in section 414(v) of the Code and excluding Default Before-Tax
Contributions distributed pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 3.2 (relating to withdrawal of Default Before-Tax Contributions), and (ii) the After-Tax Contributions made by the Participant for such payroll period. Any Employer
Matching Contributions made by an Employer with respect to Default Before-Tax Contributions that are withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Section 3.2, plus any earnings, shall be forfeited and used to reduce future Employer Matching
Contributions made by an Employer pursuant to this Section.      In addition to the Employer Matching Contributions described
above, in the case of a New England Plan Participant, as defined in Supplement IV attached hereto, whose Before-Tax Contributions exceed the limit described in Section 4.2 (relating to the 402(g) annual limit on Before-Tax Contributions), an
additional Employer Matching Contribution shall be made on behalf of such Participant in an amount equal to the amount described in clause (iii) above assuming that such Participant had continued making the same rate of Before-Tax Contributions
that were in effect with respect to such Participant at the time such Before-Tax Contributions exceeded the limit described in Section 4.2.      (b)  Special Part-Time Employees . Notwithstanding paragraph (a) hereof, no Employer shall make a contribution pursuant to this Section 4.3 on behalf of any Participant who is a
 part-time regular employee  as defined in an Agreement dated July 23, 1993 between the Company and the System Council U-25, I.B.E.W. (the  July 23, 1993 Agreement ), unless one of the following applies:   

(1)  
  the Participant had in effect on July 23, 1993 an authorization to make contributions under the Plan as then in effect and elected pursuant to the July 23,
1993 Agreement and request by the Company to become a part-time regular employee during the initial staffing period that began July 23, 1993 and ended December 31, 1993 (the  Initial Staffing Period      
         20   

(2)  
  the Participant had in effect on the date the Participant became a part-time regular employee an authorization to make contributions under the Plan as then in effect
and chose the Option II Benefits Package as described in the July 23, 1993 Agreement, as amended;         

(3)  
  the Participant did not have in effect on the date the Participant became a part-time regular employee an authorization to make contributions under the Plan as then in
effect and elected pursuant to the July 23, 1993 Agreement and request by the Company to become a part-time regular employee during the Initial Staffing Period; provided such Participant had in effect on any date after December 24, 1995
and before February 20, 1996 an authorization to make contributions under the Plan; or         

(4)  
  the Participant elected other than pursuant to the July 23, 1993 Agreement to become a part-time regular employee during the Initial Staffing Period; provided that
such Participant had in effect on any date after December 24, 1995 and before February 20, 1996 and authorization to make contributions under the Plan.        (c)  Time of Delivery of Contributions . Employer Matching Contributions for any Plan Year shall be delivered to the Trustee at the same time the Before-Tax contributions or After-Tax Contributions
to which such Employer Matching Contributions relate are delivered to the Trustee.       Section 4.4 .  Limitations on
Contributions for Highly-Compensated Eligible Employees .      (a)  Limits Imposed by Section 401(k)(3) of the Code .
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1 (relating to Before-Tax Contributions), if the Before-Tax Contributions for a Plan Year fail, or in the judgment of the Administrator are likely to fail, to satisfy both of the tests set forth in
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the adjustments prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this Section 4.4 shall be made.       

(1)  
  The average deferral percentage for the group consisting of highly compensated eligible employees of all Employers does not exceed the product of the average deferral
percentage for the group consisting of non-highly compensated eligible employees multiplied by 1.25.         

(2)  
    The average deferral percentage for the group consisting of highly compensated eligible employees of all Employers (i) does not exceed the average
deferral percentage for the group consisting of non-highly compensated eligible employees by more than two percentage points, and      
         21   

(ii) does not exceed two times the average deferral percentage for such group.         Effective for payroll periods beginning on or after August 1, 2002, any Additional Before-Tax Contributions which are  Catch-Up Contributions  described in paragraph (d) of
Section 4.1 shall not be considered as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining whether the tests set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection are satisfied or for purposes of making any adjustments prescribed in
paragraph (e) of this Section 4.4.      (b)  Limits Imposed by Section 401(m) of the Code . Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 4.3 (relating to Employer Matching Contributions) and Section 5.1 (relating to After-Tax Contributions), if the Employer Matching Contributions and After-Tax Contributions for a Plan Year fail, or in the judgment
of the Administrator are likely to fail, to satisfy both of the tests set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the adjustments prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be made.   

(1)  
  The average contribution percentage for the group consisting of highly compensated eligible employees of all Employers does not exceed the product of the average
contribution percentage for the group consisting of non-highly compensated eligible employees multiplied by 1.25.         

(2)  
  The average contribution percentage for the group consisting of highly compensated eligible employees of all Employers (i) does not exceed the average contribution
percentage for the group consisting of non-highly compensated eligible employees by more than two percentage points, and (ii) does not exceed two times the average contribution percentage for such group.     
  (c)  Aggregate Limit on Contributions .  Deleted in its entirety.    
  (d)  Definitions . For purposes of this Section 4.4:   

(1)  
    the  average deferral percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios,
calculated separately for each Eligible Employee in such group to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the Before-Tax Contributions made for the benefit of such Eligible Employee to the total compensation paid to such Eligible Employee for
the portion of such Plan Year during which such Eligible Employee was a Participant, except that no Additional Before-Tax      
         22   

Contributions which are  Catch-Up Contributions  described in paragraph (d) of Section 4.1 or Default Before-Tax Contributions that are withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii)
of Section 3.2 shall be considered as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining a Participant s average deferral percentage;          

(2)  
  the  average contribution percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios, calculated separately
for each Eligible Employee in such group to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the Employer Matching Contributions made, After-Tax Contributions made and, in the Administrator s sole discretion, to the extent permitted under
Regulations or otherwise under the Code, the Before-Tax Contributions made during such year for the benefit of such Eligible Employee, except that no Additional Before-Tax Contributions which are  Catch-Up Contributions  described in
paragraph (d) of Section 4.1, shall be considered as Before-Tax Contributions for purposes of determining a Participant s average contribution percentage, to such Eligible Employee s compensation for the portion of such Plan Year
during which such Eligible Employee was a Participant;         

(3)  
  the term  highly compensated eligible employee  shall mean any Eligible Employee who is a Participant, who performs service in the determination year and who
(a) is a 5%-owner (as determined under section 416(i)(1)(A)(iii) of the Code) at any time during the Plan Year or the preceding Plan Year or (b) both (1) is paid compensation in excess of $80,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost
of living in accordance with section 414(q) of the Code) from an Employer for the preceding Plan Year, and (2) is in the group of employees consisting of the top 20% of the employees of the Employer and its Affiliates when ranked on the basis
of compensation paid during such preceding Plan Year;         

(4)  
  the term  non-highly compensated eligible employee  shall mean any Eligible Employee who is a Participant, who performs services in the determination year and
is not a highly compensated eligible employee;         

(5)  
  the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in section 414(s) of the Code or, in the discretion of the Administrator, any other meaning in
accordance with the Code for these purposes, except that for purposes of determining whether an Eligible Employee is a  highly compensated eligible employee , as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this Section 4.4,
 compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in section 415(c)(3) of the Code;         

(6)  
    if this Plan and one or more other plans of the Employer to which Before-Tax Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, or qualified nonelective
contributions (as such term is defined in section 401(m)(4)(C) of the Code) are made are treated as one plan for purposes of section 410(b) of the Code, such plans shall be treated as one plan for purposes of this Section. If a
     
         23   

highly compensated eligible employee participates in this Plan and one or more other plans of the Employer to which any such contributions are made, all such contributions shall be aggregated for
purposes of this Section 4.4; and          

(7)  
  if this Plan benefits Employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and employees who are not included in such
collective bargaining unit, this Plan shall be treated as comprising two or more separate plans, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with applicable Regulations, for purposes of this Section 4.4. If such other plan has a plan year
that is different from the Plan Year of this Plan, then the highly compensated eligible employee s contributions made to such other plan during the Plan Year of this Plan shall be aggregated with contributions of the same type made to this Plan
for such Plan Year for purposes of determining the average deferral percentage and average contribution percentage for this Plan for such Plan Year for the group of highly compensated eligible employees.     
  This paragraph is inserted at the request of the Internal Revenue Service in order to obtain a favorable determination
letter. In computing the  average deferral percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year, the Before-Tax Contributions that will be taken into account for such Plan Year will be only those that relate to
compensation that would have been received by the Eligible Employee in the Plan Year or is attributable to services performed by the Eligible Employee in the Plan Year and would have been received by the Eligible Employee within 2-1/2 months after
the close of the Plan Year. In computing the  average contribution percentage  for a group of Eligible Employees with respect to a Plan Year, (i) an After-Tax Contribution will be taken into account only if it is paid to the Trust
during such Plan Year or paid to an agent of the Plan and transmitted to the Trust within a reasonable time after the end of the Plan Year; (ii) an excess contribution that is recharacterized will be taken into account during the Plan Year in
which the contribution would have been received in cash by the Eligible Employee had the Eligible Employee not elected to defer the contribution; (iii) an Employer Matching Contribution will be taken into account only if it is made on account
of the Eligible   
         24   

Employee s Before-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions, allocated to the Eligible Employee s Account as of a date within that Plan Year and paid to the Trust by the end of the
twelfth month following the close of such Plan Year; and (iv) qualified matching contributions which are used to meet the requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A) of the Code are not to be taken into account for purposes of the actual deferral
percentage test of section 401(m) of the Code. To the extent required by law, the following will be treated as separate plans for purposes of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) of the Code: (i) the portion of the Plan that is a 401(k) plan,
(ii) the portion of the Plan that is a section 401(m) plan; (iii) the portion of the plan that provides for contributions other than elective, employee or matching; (iv) the portion of the Plan that is an ESOP; and (v) the
portion of the plan that is not an ESOP.      (e)  Adjustments to Comply with Limits .   
  (1)  Adjustments to Comply with Section 401(k)(3) of the Code . The Administrator shall cause to be made such
periodic computations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether either of the tests set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied during a Plan Year, and, if it appears to the Administrator
that neither of such tests will be satisfied, the Administrator shall take such steps as it deems necessary or appropriate to reduce or otherwise adjust the Before-Tax Contributions contributed or to be contributed for all or a portion of such Plan
Year on behalf of Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees to the extent necessary in order for one of such tests to be satisfied. If, as of the end of the Plan Year, the Administrator determines that, notwithstanding any
adjustments made pursuant to the preceding sentence, neither of the tests set forth in paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied with respect to such Plan Year, the total amount by which
  
         25   

Before-Tax Contributions must be reduced in order to satisfy either such test shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by section 401(k)(8)(B) of the Code (the  excess contributions
amount ). The Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of the Participant who is a highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions is the highest shall be reduced until such dollar amount equals
the next highest actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions made for such Plan Year on behalf of any highly compensated employee, or until the total reduction equals the excess contributions amount. If further reductions are necessary, then
the Before-Tax Contributions on behalf of each Participant who is a highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of Before-Tax Contributions is the highest (after the reduction described in the preceding sentence) shall be
reduced in accordance with the previous sentence. Such reductions shall continue to be made to the extent necessary so that the total reduction equals the excess contributions amount.   
  To the extent that the sum of such reductions with respect to a Participant and the amount of other After-Tax
Contributions allocated to such Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account does not exceed 20 percent (10 percent in the case of a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15) of the Participant s
Compensation, the amount of such reductions shall be treated as an After-Tax Contribution. To the extent such amount cannot be treated as an After-Tax Contribution because of the limitation described in the preceding sentence, such amount, plus any
income and minus any loss allocable thereto through the end of the Plan Year for which the After-Tax Contribution was made, shall be distributed to such Participant no later than the last day of the subsequent Plan Year and the Participant shall
forfeit any corresponding Employer Matching Contributions related thereto plus any income and minus any loss   
         26   

allocable thereto through the end of the Plan Year for which the Employer Matching Contribution was made. The Participant shall designate the extent to which such distributed excess contributions
are treated as Untaxed Contributions or Designated Roth Contributions (but only up to the extent that such types of contributions were made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year) and, in the event that any such designation is not made or
is incomplete, such distributed excess contributions shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions up to the extent Untaxed Contributions were made to the Plan for the Plan Year and, to the extent that such distributed excess contributions exceed such
Untaxed Contributions, such excess contributions shall be treated as distributions of Designated Roth Contributions made to the Plan for the Plan Year.      The amount of Before-Tax Contributions to be distributed to a Participant pursuant to this Section shall be reduced by any Before-Tax Contributions previously distributed to such Participant pursuant to
Section 4.2(b) (relating to correction of Excess Before-Tax Contributions) for such Plan Year. The amount of any income or loss allocable to any such reductions to be so distributed shall be determined pursuant to Regulations. The unadjusted
amount of any such reductions so distributed shall be treated as  annual additions  for purposes of Section 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code).   
  (2)  Adjustments to Comply with Section 401(m) of the Code . The Administrator shall cause to be made such
periodic computations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether either of the tests set forth in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied during a Plan Year, and, if it appears to the Administrator
that neither of such tests will be satisfied, the Administrator shall take such steps as it deems necessary or appropriate to adjust the Employer Matching   
         27   

Contributions made, After-Tax Contributions made, and any Before-Tax Contributions treated as Employer Matching Contributions pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this Section 4.4 for all or a
portion of such Plan Year on behalf of Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees to the extent necessary in order for one of such tests to be satisfied. If after the end of a Plan Year it is determined that regardless of any steps
taken neither of the tests set forth in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall be satisfied with respect to such Plan Year, the Administrator shall calculate the total amount by which any such contributions on behalf of
Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees must be reduced in order to satisfy either such test, in the manner prescribed by section 401(m)(6) of the Code (the  excess aggregate contributions amount ). The amount to be
reduced with respect to Participants who are highly compensated eligible employees shall be determined by first reducing the After-Tax Contributions (including Before-Tax Contributions recharacterized as After-Tax Contributions pursuant to paragraph
(e)(1) of this Section 4.4) and then by reducing the Employer Matching Contributions for each Participant whose actual dollar amount of such aggregate contributions for such Plan Year is highest until such reduced dollar amount equals the next
highest dollar amount of such contributions for such Plan Year on behalf of any other highly compensated eligible employee, or until the total reduction equals the excess aggregate contributions amount. If further reductions are necessary, such
contributions on behalf of each Participant who is a highly compensated eligible employee and whose actual dollar amount of such contributions is the highest (after the reduction described in the preceding sentence) shall be reduced in accordance
with the preceding sentence. Such reductions shall continue to be made to the extent necessary until the total reduction equals the excess aggregate contributions amount. If After-Tax Contributions
  
         28   

are distributed pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2), any corresponding Employer Matching Contributions related thereto plus any income and minus any loss allocable through the end of the Plan Year
for which the Employer Matching Contributions were made to which such Participant would be entitled under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) if such Participant had terminated employment on the last day of
the Plan Year for which contributions were made (or earlier if any such Participant actually terminated employment at any earlier date) shall also be distributed with such After-Tax Contributions (and taken into account to determine whether further
reductions are necessary), and any remaining amount of such corresponding Employer Matching Contributions plus any income and minus any loss allocable through the end of the Plan Year for which the Employer Matching Contributions were made shall be
forfeited. If the reductions required by this subparagraph exceed the amount of After-Tax Contributions made or to be made by any Participant for such Plan Year and the amount of Employer Matching Contributions made or to be made on behalf of such
Participant for such Plan Year, any Before-Tax Contributions made on behalf of such Participant that the Administrator has elected to treat as Employer Matching Contributions pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this Section 4.4 shall also be
adjusted and taken into account in accordance with this subparagraph, except that such Before-Tax Contributions may not be recharacterized as After-Tax Contributions.       Section 4.5 .  Limitation on Employer Contributions .      The
contributions of an Employer for any Plan Year shall not exceed the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year of such Employer that coincides with such Plan Year.
  
         29   

Any contribution made by an Employer by reason of a good faith mistake of fact, or the
portion of any contribution made by an Employer that exceeds the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes by reason of a good faith mistake in determining the maximum allowable deduction,
shall upon the request of such Employer be returned by the Trustee to the Employer. An Employer s request and the return of any such contribution must be made within one year after such contribution was mistakenly made or after the deduction of
such excess portion of such contribution was disallowed, as the case may be. The amount to be returned to an Employer pursuant to this paragraph shall be the excess of (i) the amount contributed over (ii) the amount that would have been
contributed had there not been a mistake of fact or a mistake in determining the maximum allowable deduction. Earnings attributable to the mistaken contribution shall not be returned to the Employer, but losses attributable thereto shall reduce the
amount to be so returned. If the return to the Employer of the amount attributable to the mistaken contribution would cause the balance of any Participant s account as of the date such amount is to be returned (determined as if such date
coincided with the close of a Plan Year) to be reduced to less than what would have been the balance of such account as of such date had the mistaken amount not been contributed, the amount to be returned to the Employer shall be limited so as to
avoid such reduction.      Any Before-Tax Contributions returned to an Employer pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall be treated
as the return of Untaxed Contributions, up to the extent Untaxed Contributions were made by such Participant to the Plan for such Plan Year and, to the extent that the returned contributions exceed such Untaxed Contributions, such returned
contributions shall be treated as Designated Roth Contributions made by the Participant to the Plan for the Plan Year.   
         30   

ARTICLE 5       EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS       Section 5.1 .  After-Tax Contributions .
     Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.4 (relating to limitations on contributions for highly-compensated
Eligible Employees) and Section 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code), each Participant who is an Eligible Employee may elect in accordance with Section 3.2(a) to make After-Tax Contributions under
the Plan by payroll deduction. After-Tax Contributions made by a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 for any payroll period shall equal a whole percentage not less than 1 nor more than 10 percent of
the Participant s Compensation for such payroll period, as designated by the Participant in his or her request pursuant to Section 3.2(a). After-Tax Contributions made by any other Participant for any payroll period shall equal a whole
percentage not less than 1 nor more than 20 percent and, effective as of January 1, 2006, 50 percent, of the Participant s Compensation for such payroll period, as designated by the Participant in his or her request pursuant to
Section 3.2(a). Except as set forth below, After-Tax Contributions shall be delivered to the Trustee no less frequently than bi-weekly. In addition, if back-pay is awarded to a Participant who is an Eligible Employee and any portion of such
back-pay constitutes Compensation as defined in subsection (13) of Article 2 (relating to the definition of compensation), After-Tax Contributions shall be made for such Participant in an amount equal to the After-Tax Contribution percentage,
which was most recently chosen by the Participant in his or her request pursuant to Section 3.2(a), of such back-pay that constitutes Compensation. An After-Tax Contribution described in the preceding sentence shall be treated under the Plan in
the same manner as all other After-Tax Contributions and shall be delivered to the Trustee as soon as practicable after the back-pay is paid to the Participant. Except as provided in the following
  
         31   

sentence and in Section 4.1, After-Tax Contributions shall be subject to the same provisions regarding commencement, change and suspension applicable to Before-Tax Contributions as set forth
in Section 4.1. If a Participant who has not attained age 59   1   /  2   makes a withdrawal of After-Tax Contributions pursuant to Section 8.1(c), then: (a) After-Tax Contributions made by such Participant pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall cease beginning with
the first payroll period beginning after the date on which the Participant receives such withdrawal and (b) such Participant shall not again be eligible to elect such contributions until the first payroll period that coincides with or follows
the date on which contributions ceased by 6 months.        Section 5.2 .  Rollover Contributions .

403(a) of the Code, (B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, (C) an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality
of a state or political subdivision of a state or (D) an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income. The
amounts transferred must be eligible rollover distributions, as defined in section 402(c) of the Code. An eligible rollover distribution to a   
         32   

Separation Eligible Participant  from the PECO Energy Company Service Annuity System may also be contributed to this Plan in accordance herewith no later than December 31, 2002.

     (b)  Delivery of Rollover Contributions to Administrator . Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section 5.2, if an individual desires to make a rollover contribution pursuant to such paragraph (a), such contribution either (i) shall be delivered by the individual to the Administrator and by the Administrator to the Trustee on or
before the 60th day after the day on which the Employee receives the distribution or on or before such later date as may be prescribed by law, or (ii) shall be transferred on behalf of the individual directly from the trust from which the
eligible rollover distribution is made. Any contribution that is delivered by the Eligible Employee must be accompanied by (i) a statement of the Employee that to the best of his or her knowledge the amount so transferred meets the conditions
specified in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.2, (ii) a copy of such documents as may have been received by the Employee advising him or her of the amount of and the character of such distribution and (iii) any investment election
with respect to such contribution in such form and manner as may be required by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall not accept a rollover contribution if in its judgment accepting such contribution would cause
the Plan to violate any provision of the Code or Regulations, and the Administrator shall not be required to accept such a contribution to the extent it consists of property other than cash.   
   Section 5.3 .  Special Accounting Rules for Rollover Contributions .   
  If a rollover contribution is made by or on behalf of an Employee, the Administrator shall cause a Rollover Account to be established and
maintained for such Employee to which shall be   
         33   

credited all rollover contributions made pursuant to Section 5.2. A rollover contribution shall be credited to such Rollover Account as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or next
following the date on which such contribution is delivered to the Trustee.      If a rollover contribution is made by, or a direct
transfer is made on behalf of, an Eligible Employee prior to becoming a Participant, such Eligible Employee shall until such time as he or she becomes a Participant be deemed to be a Participant, and his or her Rollover Account and After-Tax
Contributions Account, if any, shall be deemed to be an account of a Participant, for all purposes of the Plan except for the purposes of the allocation of contributions provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of

therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement. The Trustee shall make distributions from the Trust Fund at such time or times to such person or persons and in such amounts as the
Administrator directs in accordance with the Plan.       Section 6.2 .  Investment Funds .

         34   

purchased by the Trustee, in accordance with the Trust Agreement, pending the selection and purchase of the Common Stock or as otherwise determined by the Trustee to be necessary to satisfy such
fund s cash needs. In addition, as directed by the Investment Fiduciary, one or more additional separate investment funds shall be established and maintained and shall be invested as directed by the Investment Fiduciary. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the Investment Fiduciary may purchase a group annuity contract from an insurance company that permits investment in one or more separate investment funds. The Investment Fiduciary also may, from time to time, and in its sole
discretion, segregate any of the assets held under any investment fund established pursuant to this Section 6.2 and allocate the investment results from such segregated assets among all or a portion of the accounts of Participants in such
manner as it shall determine to be appropriate. All charges and expenses incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of investments for a fund shall be charged to such fund except to the extent such charges and expenses are paid by the
Employers.       ARTICLE 7       PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENT ELECTIONS       Section 7.1 .

fund).   
         35   

Each such investment account shall, to the extent appropriate, be composed of the following
accounts: (A) a Before-Tax Contributions Account, which shall be divided into an Untaxed Contribution Account and a Designated Roth Contributions Account, (B) a Catch-Up Contributions Account, (C) an Employer Matching Contributions
Account, (D) an After-Tax Contributions Account, and (E) a Rollover Account. Earnings and losses on investment of funds in each account shall be credited or debited to that account.   
  All such accounts and subaccounts shall be for accounting purposes only, and there shall be no segregation of assets within the
investment funds among the separate Participants  accounts.      (b)  Investment Election . Each Participant, as part of
his or her request for participation described in Section 3.2 (or in connection with the delivery of a rollover contribution pursuant to Section 5.2), shall make an investment election that shall apply to the investment of contributions to
be made on his or her behalf or by him or her pursuant to Article 4 (relating to Employer contributions) or Article 5 (relating to Employee contributions) and any earnings on such contributions. Such election shall specify that such
contributions be invested either (i) wholly in one of the funds maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1 or (ii) divided among such funds in 1 percent increments or in such other
increments established by the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary from time to time. Each Eligible Employee for whom a Rollover Account is established before such Eligible Employee has become a Participant shall, in the manner prescribed by
the Administrator, make such investment election as of the Valuation Date on which such account is established. During any period in which no direction as to the investment of an Employee s account is on file with the Administrator,
contributions or direct transfers made by him or her, or on his or her behalf, to the Plan will be invested in such manner as the Investment Fiduciary shall determine.   
         36   

(c)  Change of Investment Election . Subject to such restrictions as may
be imposed by the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary (including, without limitation, any restrictions imposed with respect to transfers of funds to or from the Employer Stock Fund described in Section 6.2 by individuals who are subject
to Rule16b-3 under section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), a Participant may elect to change as of any Valuation Date his or her investment election applicable to all or any portion of his or her current account balance. In addition, a
Participant may elect to change as of the first day of any payroll period his or her investment election applicable to future contributions made pursuant to Articles 4 (relating to Employer contributions) or 5 (relating to Employee contributions),
or both, as specified by the Participant. Such changes shall be limited to the investment funds then maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1. A Participant s change of investment election
must be made in the manner and at the time prescribed by the Administrator (or its delegate). Any such change shall specify that such contributions be invested either (i) wholly in one of the funds maintained or employed by the Trustee pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.1, or (ii) divided among such funds in 1 percent increments or such other increments established by the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary from time to time.   
   Section 7.2 .  Allocation of Net Income of Trust Fund and Fluctuation in Value of Trust Fund Assets .   
  In the event that contributions, income and losses are not otherwise specifically allocated to Participant accounts by the Trustee, as
soon as practical after each Valuation Date, the net worth of each investment fund (as defined in Section 6.2) as of such Valuation Date shall be determined. If the net worth of such investment fund as so determined is more or less than the
total of all balances credited as of such Valuation Date to the subaccounts of Participants invested in the investment fund as of such Valuation Date who are Participants as of such Valuation Date, the
  
         37   

amount of any excess or deficiency shall be prorated and credited or charged to such subaccounts proportionally to the balances of such subaccounts as of the preceding Valuation Date after making
all allocations for such preceding Valuation Date prescribed by this Article and after decreasing each such subaccount by any loans, withdrawals or distributions from such subaccount during such period (but not less than zero), with all of such
decreases to be made in such manner as the Administrator determines in its discretion to be necessary.      Notwithstanding any
provision of this Article 7, any Designated Roth Contributions Account shall be maintained in a manner that satisfies the separate accounting requirement, and any Regulations or other requirements promulgated, under section 402A of the Code.
Accordingly, gains, losses and other credits and charges shall be separately allocated on a reasonable basis to each such account and other accounts under the Plan, the Plan shall keep a record of each Participant s Designated Roth
Contributions that have not been withdrawn, and contributions and withdrawals of Designated Roth Contributions, and related earnings, shall be accounted for with respect to Designated Roth Contributions Accounts. However, forfeitures shall not be
allocated to any Designated Roth Contributions Account. These separate accounting requirements apply with respect to a Participant from the time the Participant makes his or her first Designated Roth Contribution until the time the
Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account is distributed.       Section 7.3 .  Allocations of
Contributions Among Participants  Accounts .      (a)  Allocation of Before-Tax Contributions . Before-Tax

practical after such contributions are delivered to the Trustee or insurer maintaining a group annuity contract.      (c)

Rollover contributions made pursuant to Article 5 (relating to Employee contributions) shall be credited to the Rollover Account of
the Participant on whose behalf such contribution is made as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or next following the date on which the contribution is delivered to the Trustee.   
  (f)  Allocation of Forfeitures . The total amount forfeited during any Plan Year shall be used to (i) pay the expenses incurred
by the Trustee for the administration of the Trust Fund not paid by the Company, (ii) held to pay the expenses reasonably estimated by the Trustee for the administration of the Trust Fund during the next following Plan Year but not expected to
be paid by the Company, or (iii) used to reduce Employer Matching Contributions as determined by the Administrator.   
   Section 7.4 .  Limitations on Allocations Imposed by Section 415 of the Code .   
  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the amount allocated to a Participant s accounts under the Plan for each Plan Year
shall be limited so that the aggregate annual additions to the Participant s accounts under this Plan and in all other defined contribution plans maintained by an Employer shall not exceed the lesser of: (A) $46,000 (as adjusted pursuant
to section 415(d) of the Code) and (B) 100% of the Participant s compensation for such Plan Year.      If the amount to
be allocated to a Participant s accounts pursuant to Section 7.3 (relating to allocations of contributions among Participant s accounts) for a Plan Year would exceed the limitation set forth in this Section 7.4, then such excess
shall be reduced before allocations are made to the Participant s accounts. If, in any Plan Year, the annual additions actually allocated to the Participant s accounts exceed the limitation set forth in this Section 7.4, then such
annual   
         40   

additions shall be corrected in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System of the Internal Revenue Service.   
  For purposes of this Section 7.4, the  annual additions  for a Plan Year to a Participant s accounts in this Plan and

Participant s accounts, excluding, however, (X) Before-Tax Contributions and Designated Roth Contributions that are  catch-up contributions  made pursuant to section 414(v) of the Code, (Y) excess deferrals that are
distributed in accordance with section 402(g) of the Code and (Z) restorative payments (within the meaning of section 1.415(c)-1(b)(2)(ii)(C) of the Regulations),   
  (b) the amount of forfeitures allocated to the Participant s accounts,   
  (c) the amount of Employee contributions allocated to the Participant accounts, but excluding any rollover contributions,
direct transfers or loan repayments, and      (d) the contributions allocated on behalf of the Participant to any
individual medical benefit account (as defined in section 415(l) of the Code) or, if the Participant is a key employee within the meaning of section 419A(d)(3) of the Code, to any post-retirement medical benefits account established pursuant to
section 419A(d)(1) of the Code.      For purposes of this Section 7.4,  defined contribution plan  shall have the
meaning set forth in section 415 of the Code and Regulations, and the term  Employer  shall include all Affiliates except that in defining Affiliates  more than 50 percent  shall be substituted for  at least 80 percent 
where required by section 415(g) of the Code. In addition, for purposes of this Section 7.4,  compensation  shall mean a Participant s compensation as defined under section 415(c)(3) of the Code (as amended from time to time).

adjustment shall be made to the accounts of all Participants and designated Beneficiaries that are affected by such error, except that no adjustment need be made with respect to any Participant

Before-Tax Contributions Account (other than earnings credited to such account after December 31, 1988), Catch-Up Contributions Account and Employer Matching Contributions Account only if the Participant has incurred a financial hardship,
except that while any loan to the Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal under this paragraph (a) shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the
Participant. The determination of the existence of financial hardship and the amount required to be distributed to satisfy the need created by the hardship will be made by the Administrator in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner subject to the
following rules:       (A) A financial hardship shall be deemed to exist if, and only if, the Participant
certifies to the Committee that the financial need is on account of:       

(i)  
  medical expenses described in section 213(d) of the Code incurred or anticipated to be incurred by the Participant, the Participant s Spouse or any dependents of
the Participant (as defined in section 152 of the Code) or primary beneficiary;         

(ii)

(v)  
  the need to prevent eviction of the Participant from his or her principal residence or foreclosure of mortgage of the Participant s principal residence; or

(vi)  
  expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant s principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under section 165 of the Code (determined
without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income).        For purposes of the foregoing, an
individual is a Participant s  primary beneficiary  if the Participant has designated him or her as a  Beneficiary  under Section 8.5 and such individual has an unconditional right to all or a portion of the
Participant s accounts upon the Participant s death.      (B) A distribution shall be deemed to be
necessary to satisfy a financial need of the Participant if, and only if, the Participant:       

(i)  
  has obtained all distributions, other than hardship withdrawals, and all nontaxable loans under any Employer s plan in which the Participant participates, and

(ii)  
  demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the distribution is not in excess of the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need, which need shall
include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state and local income taxes, excise taxes and penalties.        If a
Participant receives a hardship withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (a), then, in addition to the cessation of Before-Tax Contributions and After-Tax Contributions required by paragraph (a) of Section 4.1 (relating to initial election
regarding regular payroll Before-Tax Contributions), contributions by the Participant to qualified or nonqualified plans of deferred   
         43   

compensation, including a stock option, stock purchase or similar plan, maintained by an Employer also shall cease beginning with the first payroll period beginning after the date on which the
Participant receives such hardship withdrawal and continuing until the first payroll period that coincides with or follows the date on which contributions ceased by six months.   
  The Participant shall designate the extent to which the hardship withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (a) are Designated Roth
Contributions from the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event that any such designation is not made
or is incomplete, such hardship withdrawals shall be treated as withdrawals of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that the hardship withdrawal exceeds such Designated
Roth Contributions, such hardship withdrawal shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions.      (b)
 Withdrawals After Age 59   1   /  2     . An Employee who has attained age 59   1   /  2   may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw as of any date an amount which is not greater than the balance of his or her
Before-Tax Contributions Account, Catch-Up Contributions Account and Employer Matching Contributions Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the Participant under Section 8.2
remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the balance in such accounts less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.        The Participant shall designate the extent to which the withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph (b) are Designated Roth Contributions from the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account
and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant s Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event that any such designation is not   
         44   

made or is incomplete, such withdrawals shall be treated as withdrawals of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that
the withdrawal exceeds such Designated Roth Contributions, such withdrawal shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions.      (c)
 Withdrawals From the After-Tax Contributions Account . An Employee may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, no more than once during any Plan Year, to withdraw from his or her
After-Tax Contributions Account an amount which is not greater than the balance of the Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the
Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.   
  (d)  Withdrawals from the Rollover Account . A Participant may make a request by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be
prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw an amount which is not greater than the balance in his or her Rollover Account as of the most recent Valuation Date determined by the Administrator, except that while any loan to the Participant under
Section 8.2 remains outstanding, the amount available for withdrawal shall be the balance in such account less the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.      (e)  Qualified Reservist Withdrawals . A Participant who is a Qualified Reservist may make a request by calling VRU, or in such manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to withdraw any
portion of his or her Before-Tax Contributions Account or his or her Designated Roth Contributions Account, and the amount requested shall not be subject to the 10 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to section 72(t)(2)(G) of the Code, provided
that the amount   
         45   

requested is distributed during the period beginning on the date the Participant is ordered or called to active duty and ending at the close of his or her active duty.

to the contrary, effective April 16, 2010, a Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 614 and who has completed 60 months as a Participant may elect, in accordance with procedures established by the
Administrator, to receive a distribution of all or any part of his or her Employer Matching Contributions Account, as adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto determined as of the Valuation Date next succeeding the date of
receipt of the request for distribution.      Additionally, effective April 16, 2010, a Participant who is a member of a
bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 614, regardless of whether he or she has completed 60 months as a Participant, may elect, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator, to receive a distribution of all or any part of
that portion of the Employer Matching Contributions Account that is derived from Employer Matching Contributions in excess of Employer Matching Contributions allocated to his or her Employer Matching Contributions Account during the two Plan Years
preceding the Plan Year in which the withdrawal takes place, adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto determined as of the Valuation Date next succeeding the date of receipt of the request for distribution.   
  No distribution made pursuant to this paragraph (f) may be for an amount which is less than the lesser of (i) $200; and
(ii) the balance of the Participant s Employer Matching Contributions Account, as adjusted for gains, earnings and losses attributable thereto. In addition, a Participant may not make more than one withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph
(f) in any Plan Year.   
         46   

(g)  Provisions Applicable to All Withdrawals . Any withdrawal made pursuant to this
Section 8.1 shall be made at such time as prescribed by the Administrator and shall be made pro-rata from each of the investment funds in which as of the date of the withdrawal (i) in the case of a withdrawal pursuant to paragraph

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.      (h)  Dividend Distributions in Respect of the Employer Stock Fund . Dividends shall
be allocated to the accounts of each Participant, any portion of whose account balance is invested in the Employer Stock Fund in accordance with paragraph (b) of Section 7.1, based upon the total number of shares of Common Stock
represented by the Participant s proportionate share of the Employer Stock Fund as of such date as may be determined from time to time by the Administrator on or before each dividend record date. Cash dividends shall be reinvested in Common
Stock (through the Employer Stock Fund) unless the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) elects, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to receive a

such loan shall be not less than $1,000 and the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans to a Participant or Beneficiary shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) 50% of the value of the aggregate of the Participant s vested account balances as
of the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately preceding the day on which the loan is made; and (2) $50,000, reduced by the excess, if any, of the highest outstanding loan balances of the Participant under all plans maintained by the
Employer during the period of time beginning one year and one day prior to the date such loan is to be made and ending on the date such loan is to be made over the outstanding balance of loans from all such plans on the date on which such loan was
made.      (b)  Restrictions . Any loan approved by the Administrator pursuant to the preceding paragraph (a) shall be
made only upon the following terms and conditions:      (1) The period for repayment of the loan shall be arrived
at by mutual agreement between the Administrator and the Participant but such period shall not exceed five years or, in the case of a loan to acquire a principal place of residence, shall not be less than five years or more than 15 years, from the
date of the loan. Such loan may be prepaid at any time, without penalty, by delivery to the Administrator of a check in an amount equal to the entire unpaid balance of such loan. No partial prepayment shall be permitted. Except as otherwise provided
under uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Administrator, any loan to a Participant who is an Employee is due in full immediately after termination of employment.   
  (2) No loan shall be made to a Participant who is an Employee unless such Participant consents to have such loan repaid in
substantially equal installments deducted   
         48   

from the regular payments of the Participant s compensation during the term of the loan. A Participant who (a) was an Employee at the time the Participant received a loan from the Plan,
(b) is no longer an Employee and no longer receives compensation from an Employer, but (c) continues to perform services for an Employer, shall consent, either at the time the loan is taken or prior to the date prescribed by the
Administrator, to have the balance of any loan outstanding at the time the Participant no longer is an Employee repaid in substantially equal installments over the remaining life of the loan. Such installments shall be paid in the manner specified
by the Administrator.      (3) Each loan shall be evidenced by the Participant s collateral promissory note,
in the form prescribed by the Administrator, for the amount of the loan, with interest, payable to the order of the Plan, and shall be secured by an assignment of 50% of the Participant s vested account balance.   
  (4) Each loan shall bear a fixed interest rate commensurate with the interest rates then being charged by persons in the
business of lending money for loans made under similar circumstances, as determined by the Administrator.      (5)
Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, no withdrawal (other than a withdrawal from a Participant s accounts to the extent that such withdrawal would not reduce the Participant s vested account balances to less than the then outstanding
balance of any loan to such Participant or such higher amount determined by the Administrator to be appropriate security for such loan) or distribution shall be made to any Participant who has borrowed from the Trust, or to a Beneficiary of any such
Participant, unless and until the loan, including interest, has been repaid.      (6) A charge shall be made
against the account of each Participant requesting a loan equal to such reasonable loan application fee (and loan acceptance fee, if required by the Administrator) as shall be set from time to time by the Administrator.   
  (7) A Participant is permitted only one loan in any calendar year, provided, however, that no more than five loans to a
Participant may be outstanding at any time, except that for a Participant described in the following sentence, no more than three loans may be outstanding at any time (for the period beginning April 1, 2009 and ending August 31, 2010, only
one of such outstanding loans may be for the purpose of acquiring a principal place of residence and only two of such outstanding loans may be for other purposes). A Participant described in the preceding sentence is any of the following: (A) a
Participant who is a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, (B) a Participant who is employed at Byron in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Security System Union Local 1, (C) a Participant who is employed
at Oyster Creek in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Government Security Officers of America Local 17, (D) a Participant who is employed at Three Mile Island in Nuclear Security in Nuclear Security and is a member of United Government
Security Officers of America Local 18, and (E) a Participant who is classified by an Employer as a management employee.      (8) Loan repayments shall be invested in the various investment funds as elected by the Participant.   
         49   

(9) The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, restrict the amount to be
disbursed pursuant to any loan request to the extent it deems necessary to take into account any fluctuations in the value of a Participant s accounts since the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date on which such loan is to be made.
     (10) Any restrictions the Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary determines are necessary or appropriate
with respect to loans requested by individuals who have any portion of their accounts invested in the Employer Stock Fund described in Section 6.2 and who are subject to Rule 16b-3 under section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     If any loan or portion of a loan made to a Participant under the Plan, together with the accrued interest thereon, is in
default (taking into account any grace period permitted by law, and as determined by the Administrator), the Administrator shall take appropriate steps to collect on the note and foreclose on the security. If upon a Participant s termination of
employment entitling the Participant to a distribution under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment), death or retirement, any loan or portion of a loan made to such Participant under the Plan, together with the
accrued interest thereon, remains unpaid, such unpaid amount may be repaid to the Plan no later than the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which such termination of employment occurred or as of such later date or
dates permitted under uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Administrator. If full repayment is not so made, an amount equal to the unpaid portion of such loan, together with the accrued interest thereon, shall be charged to
the Participant s accounts after all other adjustments required under the Plan, but before any distribution pursuant to Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment).   
  (c)  Loan Subaccount . The Trustee shall establish and maintain a loan subaccount on behalf of each Participant or Beneficiary to
whom a loan is made under this Section 8.2. Such subaccount shall represent the investment of the Participant s or Beneficiary s account in such loan. As of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date on which a loan is
approved, the Participant s or Beneficiary s loan subaccount shall be credited with the amount of the loan and   
         50   

thereafter shall be debited with repayments of the principal of such loan. The various accounts maintained for the Participant or Beneficiary shall be invested in the loan subaccount and debited
by the amount of the loan and credited with payments of interest on, and repayments of principal of, such loan in accordance with uniform rules established by the Administrator.   
  (d)  Sarbanes-Oxley . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Administrator reserves the right to deny the
request of a Participant for a loan that, in the judgment of the Administrator, would violate any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.       Section 8.3 .  Distributions Upon Termination of Employment .   
  (a)  Termination of Employment under Circumstances Entitling Participant to Full Distribution of His or Her Account Balance . If a
Participant terminates employment, the Participant, or his or her designated Beneficiary, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive the entire balance of the Participant s accounts, at the time set forth in Section 8.4 (relating to
time of distribution) and in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section 8.3.      (b)  Form of
Distribution . (1) Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section 8.3 (relating to small benefits payable in lump sum), any distribution to which a Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, becomes entitled upon termination of
employment shall be distributed by whichever of the following forms of distribution the Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, elects by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator:   

(A)  
  By payment in a lump sum.         

(B)  
  By payment in a series of approximately equal annual, quarterly, or monthly installments, over a period of up to 15 years; provided that installments shall not be
available with respect to amounts invested in the CNA 1997 guaranteed investment contract.        A Participant who
elected to receive distribution of his or her vested account balance in the form of installments may, at any time after such election is made, elect to receive the remaining amount of his or her vested account balance in the form of a lump sum
payment. If no election is   
         51   

made by a Participant or Beneficiary, as the case may be, as to the form of distribution, the Participant s vested account balance shall be distributed in the form of a lump sum payment.
     The amount distributed hereunder shall be paid in cash, except that if the Participant s account is paid in a lump sum,
then the Participant may request that all of his or her account invested in the Employer Stock Fund be distributed in whole shares of Common Stock held in such Fund with any fractional share being paid in cash. The number of shares of Common Stock
to be distributed shall be based on the current fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Trustee under Section 7.2 (relating to allocation of net income of Trust Fund and fluctuation in value of Trust assets) as of the
Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately preceding the date payment of the Participant s account is to be made. Requests for distribution in the form of Common Stock shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Administrator shall
determine under rules and regulations which are uniformly applied.      Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, no distribution
shall be made in the form of installments with respect to a Participant s Rollover Account that was established to hold the amount distributed or directly transferred from the Commonwealth Edison Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan upon such
plan s termination if the Participant elected not to receive distribution of such amount until his or her 65th birthday.   
  (c)  Notice of Availability of Election of Optional Forms of Benefits . No less than 30 days (or such shorter period as permitted by
law) and no more than 90 days before distribution is to be made hereunder, the Administrator, or its designee, shall explain to the Participant that he or she may elect either form of distribution set forth in paragraph (b) of this
Section 8.3. Such explanation shall include a general description of the eligibility conditions and other material features of the optional forms of distribution provided under the Plan. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph (c),
distribution may commence less than 30 days after the description   
         52   

described above is given, provided that: (i) the Administrator, or its designee, clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least 30 days after
receiving the explanation to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and (ii) the Participant, after receiving the explanation, affirmatively elects a distribution.
The description referred to in this paragraph (c), as well as the explanation of the participant s right to a period of at least 30 days to consider such explanation before electing a distribution, shall be provided to the Participant through
the VRU or in such other manner prescribed by the Administrator.      (d)  Small Benefits Payable in Lump Sum .
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the vested amount of the Participant s account balances does not exceed $5,000, not including the value of the Participant s Rollover Account or, for distributions occurring on
or after March 28, 2005, $1,000, including the value of the Participant s Rollover Account (such amount referred to herein as the  small benefit amount ), such vested amount shall be distributed in a lump sum cash payment as soon
as administratively practicable after the Participant s termination of employment in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Administrator.      (e)  Direct Rollover Option . In the case of a distribution from the Plan (excluding any amount offset against the Participant s account balance to repay the outstanding balance of any unpaid
loan) which is an  eligible rollover distribution  within the meaning of section 402(c)(4) of the Code, a Participant (or surviving Spouse of a Participant or a former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations
order as defined in section 414(p) of the Code) may elect that all or any portion of such distribution shall be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from this Plan to (i) an individual retirement account described in section 408(a)
of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an   
         53   

annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, (v) a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code
(the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover contributions), (vi) an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code (the terms of which permit
the acceptance of rollover contributions) or (vii) effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code. However, in the case of a distribution of a Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account prior to
January 1, 2007, such distribution shall only be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from this Plan to an account or annuity described in section 408 of the Code, or to such a retirement or annuity plan described in section 401(a)
or 403(a) of the Code that is a defined contribution plan that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible. In the case of a distribution of a Participant s After-Tax Contributions Account on or after January 1, 2007, such distribution shall only be directly transferred as a rollover contribution to an
account or annuity described in section 408 of the Code, or to such a qualified retirement or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph (e), in the case of any eligible rollover distribution
that includes all or any portion of the Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account, a Participant or surviving Spouse or a former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p)
of the Code may elect to transfer such portion only to another plan which accounts for Designated Roth Contributions described in section 402A of the Code or to a Roth IRA described in section 408A
  
         54   

of the Code and only to the extent the rollover is permitted by the rules of section 402(c) of the Code. In addition, in the case of a distribution described in the preceding sentence that occurs
on or after January 1, 2008, a Beneficiary who is not the surviving Spouse of the Participant may elect that all or any portion of such distribution shall be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from this Plan to (i) an
individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code or (iii) effective January 1, 2010, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code,
that, in either case, is established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of the Beneficiary.   
   Section 8.4 .  Time of Distribution .      A Participant who has terminated employment shall commence receiving distribution of his or her vested account balance as soon as administratively practical after the Valuation Date coinciding with or
immediately following the date on which the Participant attains age 65, except as provided below.       

(1)  
   Early Distribution . Except as provided in subparagraph (7), a Participant whose Termination Date is prior to his or her 65th birthday may elect by calling the
VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, prior to his or her termination of employment to have distribution of his or her vested account balance commence within 60 days after the Valuation Date coinciding with or
immediately following the Participant s Termination Date.         

(2)  
     Deferral of Distribution . A Participant may elect by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, which
election shall be made at the time prescribed by the Administrator, that distribution of his or her vested account balance commence as soon as practicable after the Participant s attainment of age 70   1   /  2  .       

(3)  
     Elections After Termination Date . Except as provided in subparagraph (7), a Participant who has terminated employment and whose distribution is
to commence either after the Participant s attainment of age 65 or 70   1   /  2   may elect at any time by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator, to have distribution of his or her vested account balance made within 60 days after the date
such election is made.           

(4)  
     Required Beginning Date . Distributions paid or commencing during the Participant s lifetime shall commence not later than April 1 of
the calendar year      
         55   

following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70   1   /  2  , except that distributions made to a Participant who is not a  five percent owner  (as defined in section 416(i) of the Code) may commence on April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70   1   /  2   or the calendar year in which the Participant retires. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, any distributions required by this subparagraph shall be made not less rapidly than in
accordance with the final Regulations under Section 401(a)(9). The Participant shall designate the extent to which the distribution of Before-Tax Contributions pursuant to this subparagraph 4 are Designated Roth Contributions from the
Participant s Designated Roth Contributions Account and the extent that such withdrawals are Untaxed Contributions from the Participant s Untaxed Contributions Account and in the event that any such designation is not made or is
incomplete, such distribution shall be treated as a distribution of Designated Roth Contributions to the extent Designated Roth Contributions were made to the Plan and, to the extent that the distribution of Before-Tax Contributions exceeds such
Designated Roth Contributions, such distribution shall be treated as Untaxed Contributions.            

(5)  
     Distributions Commencing After Participant s Death . Distributions commencing after the Participant s death shall be completed within
five years after the death of the Participant, except that (i) effective with respect to any Participant whose death occurs on or after January 1, 1995, regardless of when such Participant s employment terminated, if the
Participant s Beneficiary is the Participant s Spouse, distribution may be deferred until the date on which the Participant would have attained age
70   1   /  2   had he or she survived and (ii) if the
Participant s Beneficiary is a natural person other than the Participant s Spouse and distributions commence not later than one year after the Participant s death, such distributions may be made over a period not longer than the life
expectancy of such Beneficiary. If at the time of the Participant s death, distribution of the Participant s benefit has commenced, the remaining portion of the Participant s benefit shall be paid in the manner elected by the
Participant s Beneficiary, but at least as rapidly as was the method of distribution being used prior to the Participant s death.           

(6)  
   Distribution of Rollover Account After Termination Date . A Participant who has terminated employment or the Beneficiary of such Participant, as the case may be,
may elect by calling the VRU, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator prior to the time his or her vested account balance is distributed under this Section 8.4 to have distribution of the balance of his or her Rollover
Account commence at such prior time as the Participant or Beneficiary shall elect, provided that, while any loan to the Participant under Section 8.2 remains outstanding, such distribution shall be made only to the extent that the balance of
such Participant s vested account balance remaining after such distribution will equal or exceed the balance of all outstanding loans to the Participant.     

(7)  
     Compliance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all distributions will be made in
accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including the minimum distribution incidental death benefit requirement thereof.      
         56   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount that would be a required minimum distribution described in section 401(a)(9) of the Code which is attributable to the 2009 calendar year will not be
distributed to a Participant, or his or her Beneficiary, as applicable, unless such individual elects to receive such distribution. In addition, the five-year period described in subparagraph (5) above shall be determined without regard to
calendar year 2009.         Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and except as provided in
subparagraph (4) above, in the event that the recordkeeper for the Plan is changed, distributions may be made at such time as prescribed by the Administrator in order to accommodate the transfer of records to the new recordkeeper.   
   Section 8.5 .  Designation of Beneficiary .      Each Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (who may be designated contingently or successively and that may be an entity other than a natural person) to receive any
distribution to be made under Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) upon the death of such Participant or, in the case of a Participant who dies subsequent to termination of his or her employment but prior to
the distribution of the entire amount to which he or she is entitled under the Plan, any undistributed balance to which such Participant would have been entitled,  provided ,  however , that no such designation (or change thereof) shall be
effective if the Participant was married on the date of the Participant s death unless such designation (or change thereof) was consented to at the time of such designation (or change thereof) by the person who was the Participant s
Spouse, in writing, acknowledging the effect of such consent and witnessed by a notary public or a Plan representative, or it is established to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such consent could not be obtained because the
Participant s Spouse cannot be located or such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. Subject to the preceding sentence, a Participant may from time to time, without the consent of any Beneficiary, change or cancel any such
designation. Such designation and each change therein shall be made in the form prescribed by the Administrator and shall be filed with   
         57   

the Administrator. A Participant s beneficiary designation in effect under the PECO Energy Company Employee Savings Plan immediately prior to March 31, 2001 shall remain in effect under
the Plan on and after March 31, 2001 until such time as such designation is changed or canceled in accordance with this Section 8.5. If (i) no Beneficiary has been named by a deceased Participant, (ii) such designation is not
effective pursuant to the proviso contained in the first sentence of this section, or (iii) the designated Beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, any undistributed balance of the deceased Participant shall be distributed by the Trustee at
the direction of the Administrator (a) to the surviving Spouse of such deceased Participant, if any, or (b) if there is no surviving Spouse, to the surviving children of such deceased Participant, if any, in equal shares, or (c) if
there is no surviving Spouse or surviving children, to the surviving parents of such deceased Participant, if any, in equal shares, or (d) if there is no surviving Spouse, surviving children or surviving parents, to the executor or
administrator of the estate of such deceased Participant or (e) if no executor or administrator has been appointed for the estate of such deceased Participant within six months following the date of the Participant s death, in equal shares
to the person or persons who would be entitled under the intestate succession laws of the state of the Participant s domicile to receive the Participant s personal estate. The marriage of a Participant shall be deemed to revoke any prior
designation of a Beneficiary made by him or her and a divorce shall be deemed to revoke any prior designation of the Participant s divorced Spouse if written evidence of such marriage or divorce is timely received by the Administrator.
      Section 8.6 .  Distributions to Minor and Disabled Distributees .   
  Any distribution under this Article that is payable to a distributee who is a minor or to a distributee who, in the opinion of the
Administrator, is unable to manage his or her affairs by reason of illness or mental incompetency may be made to or for the benefit of any such distributee at such time consistent with the provisions of Section 8.4 (relating to time of
distribution) and in   
         58   

such of the following ways as the legal representative of such distributee shall direct: (a) directly to any such minor distributee if, in the opinion of such legal representative, the
distributee is able to manage his or her affairs, (b) to such legal representative, (c) to a custodian under a Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for any such minor distributee, or (d) to some near relative of any such distributee to be used
for the latter s benefit. Neither the Administrator nor the Trustee shall be required to see to the application by any third party other than the legal representative of a distributee of any distribution made to or for the benefit of such
distributee pursuant to this Section.       Section 8.7 .   Lost  Participants and Beneficiaries .
     If within a period of five years following the death or other termination of employment of any Participant the Administrator
in the exercise of reasonable diligence has been unable to locate the person or persons entitled to benefits under this Article 8, the rights of such person or persons shall be forfeited,  provided ,  however , that the Plan shall
reinstate and pay to such person or persons the amount of the benefits so forfeited upon a claim for such benefits made by such person or persons. The amount to be so reinstated shall be obtained from the total amount that shall have been forfeited
pursuant to Section 8.3 (relating to distribution upon termination of employment) during the Plan Year that the claim for such forfeited benefit is made. If the amount to be reinstated exceeds the amount of such forfeitures, the Employer in
respect of whose Employee the claim for forfeited benefit is made shall make a contribution in an amount equal to the remainder of such excess. Any such contribution shall be made without regard to whether or not the limitations set forth in
Section 4.5 (relating to limitation on Employer contributions) will be exceeded by such contribution.   
         59   

Section 8.8 .  Death Benefits Under USERRA    
  Effective January 1, 2007, in the case of a Participant who dies while performing Military Service, the Beneficiaries of such
Participant shall be entitled to any additional benefits, if any, (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment with an Employer and then terminated
such employment on account of such Participant s death.       ARTICLE 9    
  PARTICIPANTS  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS       Section 9.1 .  Voting Shares of Common Stock .   
  Each Participant and Beneficiary shall be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the exercise of any voting rights attributable to shares
of Common Stock then allocated to his or her account and the Trustee shall vote such shares according to the voting directions of the Participant or Beneficiary that have been timely submitted to the Trustee on forms provided by the Trustee for such
purpose. Participants and Beneficiaries shall be permitted to direct the Trustee as to the exercise of any voting rights, including, but not limited to, any corporate matter that involves the voting of shares of Common Stock with respect to the
approval or disapproval of any corporate merger or consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, liquidation, dissolution, sale of substantially all assets of a trade or business, or similar transaction prescribed in Regulations. The Trustee
shall with respect to any matter vote the shares of Common Stock credited to Participants  accounts with respect to which the Trustee does not timely receive voting instructions in the same proportion as to shares the Trustee has received
voting instructions. Written notice of any meeting of stockholders of the Company and a request for voting instructions shall be given by the Administrator or the Trustee, at such time and in such manner as the Administrator shall determine, to each
Participant or Beneficiary entitled to give instructions for voting shares of   
         60   

Common Stock at such meeting. The Administrator shall establish and pay for a means by which Participants and Beneficiaries can expeditiously deliver such voting instructions to the Trustee. All
instructions delivered by Participants or Beneficiaries shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person, including the Employer.       Section 9.2 .  Tender Offers .      (a) In the event a tender
offer is made generally to the stockholders of the Company to transfer all or a portion of their shares of Common Stock in return for valuable consideration, including but not limited to, offers regulated by section 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, each Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled to direct the Trustee regarding how to respond to any such tender offer with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock then allocated to his or her account and
the Trustee shall vote such shares according to the voting directions of the Participant or Beneficiary that have been timely submitted to the Trustee on forms provided by the Trustee for such purpose. A Participant or Beneficiary shall not be
limited in the number of directions to tender or withdraw from tender that he or she can give, but shall not have the right to give directions to tender or withdraw from tender after a reasonable time established by the Trustee pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this Section 9.2. The Trustee shall with respect to a tender offer decline to vote the shares of Common Stock credited to Participants  accounts with respect to which the Trustee does not timely receive directions on
how to respond to any such tender offer. All such directions shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person, including the Employer.      (b) Within a reasonable time after the commencement of a tender offer, the Administrator shall provide to each Participant and Beneficiary:   

(i)  
  the offer to purchase as distributed by the offeror to the stockholders of the Company,     
         61   

(ii)  
  a statement of the shares of Common Stock allocated to his or her account, and     

(iii)  
  directions as to the means by which a Participant can give directions with respect to the tender offer.     
  The Administrator shall establish and pay for a means by which a Participant and Beneficiary can expeditiously deliver directions to the
Trustee with respect to a tender offer. The Administrator shall transmit or cause to be transmitted to the Trustee aggregate numbers of shares to be tendered or withheld from tender representing directions of Participants and Beneficiaries. The
Administrator, at its election, may engage an agent to receive directions from Participants and Beneficiaries and transmit them to the Trustee.      (c) The Trustee may establish a reasonable time, taking into account the time restrictions of the tender offer, after which it shall not accept directions of Participants or Beneficiaries.

Employee shall become a Participant as of the date of such change if either the Employee is not a member of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 or the Employee has satisfied the eligibility service requirement set forth in

and the Administrator shall   
         77   

direct the Trustee to distribute the portion of the Trust Fund applicable to such Employer in the manner provided in Article 16 (relating to establishment of separate plan and termination).

for all purposes of the Plan, employment of such Employee with such Employer, including service with and compensation paid by such Employer, shall be considered to be employment with an Employer.

payment of benefits as soon as administratively practicable after the date such order is determined by the Administrator to be a  qualified domestic relations order       all as determined by the Administrator pursuant to the procedures contained in Section 11.3 (relating to procedures for domestic relations orders). Any amounts subject to a domestic relations order
prior to determination of its status as a qualified domestic relations order that but for such order would be paid to the Participant shall be segregated in a separate account or an escrow account pending such determination. If within the reasonable
time period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under a domestic relations order the Administrator determines that the domestic relations order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order, the amount
so segregated (plus any interest thereof) shall be paid to the alternate payee. If such determination is not made within such reasonable time period, then the amount so segregated (plus any interest thereon), shall, as soon as practicable after the
end of such reasonable time period, be paid to the Participant. Any determination regarding the status of such order after such reasonable time period shall be applied only to payments on or after the date of such determination.

  A merger or consolidation with, or transfer of assets or liabilities to, any other plan shall not be effected unless the terms of such merger,
consolidation or transfer are such that each Participant, distributee, Beneficiary or other person entitled to receive benefits from the Plan would, if the Plan were to terminate immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer, receive a
benefit equal to or greater than the benefit such person would be entitled to receive if the Plan were to terminate immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer.       Section 14.6 .  Gender and Plurals .      Wherever used in the Plan,

         81   

Section 14.8 .  Severability .   
  If a provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the
Plan and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included in the Plan.

Compensation   Benefits (or such other officer designated from time to time by the Chief Human Resources Officer) in response to the claimant s request for review of the adverse benefit determination and (b) no other legal or
equitable action involving the Plan may be commenced later than two years from the time the person bringing an action knew, or had reason to know, of the circumstances giving rise to the action. This provision shall not be interpreted to extend any
otherwise applicable statute of limitations, nor to bar the Plan or its fiduciaries from recovering overpayments of benefits or other amounts incorrectly paid to any person under the Plan at any time or bringing any legal or equitable action against
any party.   
         82   

Section 14.11 .  Forum for Legal Actions under the Plan .

ARTICLE 15       TOP-HEAVY PLAN REQUIREMENTS       Section 15.1 .  Top-Heavy Plan
Determination .      If as of the determination date (as defined in Section 15.2) for any Plan Year (a) the sum of
the account balances under the Plan and all other defined contribution plans in the aggregation group (as defined in Section 15.2) and (b) the present value of accrued benefits under all defined benefit plans in such aggregation group of
all Participants in such plans who are key employees (as defined in Section 15.2) for such Plan Year exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate of the account balances and present value of accrued benefits of all participants in such plans as of the
determination date (as defined in Section 15.2), then this Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year, and the requirements of Sections 15.3 (relating to minimum contribution for top-heavy years) shall be applicable for such Plan Year as
of the first day thereof. If the Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for any Plan Year and not be a top-heavy plan for any subsequent Plan Year, the requirements of this Article shall not be applicable for such subsequent Plan Year.   
   Section 15.2 .  Definitions and Special Rules .   

(a)  
   Definitions . For purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply:     

(1)  
   Determination Date . The determination date for all plans in the aggregation group shall be the last day of the preceding Plan Year, and the valuation date
applicable to a determination date shall be (i) in the case of a defined contribution plan, the date as of which account balances are determined which is coincident with or immediately precedes the determination date, and (ii) in the case
of a defined benefit plan, the date as of which the most recent actuarial valuation for the Plan Year that includes the determination date is prepared, except that if any such plan specifies a different determination or valuation date, such
different date shall be used with respect to such plan.         

(2)  
     Aggregation Group . The aggregation group shall consist of (a) each plan of an Employer in which a key Employee is a participant,
(b) each other plan that enables such a plan to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, and (c) any other plans of an Employer that the Company designates as part of the aggregation group and that shall permit the aggregation group
to      
         84   

continue to meet the requirements of sections 401(a) and 410 of the Code with such other plan being taken into account.      

(3)  
   Key Employee . Key Employee shall have the meaning set forth in section 416(i) of the Code.     

(4)  
   Compensation . Compensation shall have the meaning set forth in section 1.415(c)-2 of the Regulations.     
  (b)  Special Rules . For the purpose of determining the accrued benefit or account balance of a Participant, the accrued benefit or
account balance of any person who has not performed services for an employer at any time during the 1-year period ending on the determination date shall not be taken into account pursuant to this Section. Any person who received a distribution from
a plan (including a plan that has terminated) in the aggregation group during the 1-year period ending on the last day of the preceding Plan Year shall be treated as a Participant in such plan, and any such distribution shall be included in such
Participant s account balance or accrued benefit, except that in the case of any distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death or disability, this sentence shall be applied by substituting  5-year period 
for the  1-year period  stated herein.       Section 15.3 .  Minimum Contribution for Top-Heavy Years .
     Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the sum of the Employer contributions under Article 4 (other than
Before-Tax Contributions described in Section 4.1) allocated to the account of each Participant (other than a key Employee) during any Plan Year and the forfeitures allocated to the account of such Participant (other than a key Employee) during
any Plan Year for which the Plan is a top-heavy plan shall in no event be less than the lesser of (i) 3% of such Participant s compensation during such Plan Year and (ii) the highest percentage at which contributions are made on
behalf of any key Employee for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the percentage determined pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence is less than 3%, such percentage shall be recalculated by including Before-Tax
Contributions made   
         85   

on behalf of key employees. Such minimum contribution shall be made even if, under other provisions of the Plan, the Participant would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation or would
receive a lesser allocation for the year because of (i) the Participant s failure to complete 1,000 Hours of Service, or (ii) compensation of less than a stated amount. If, during any Plan Year for which this Section 15.3 is
applicable, a defined benefit plan is included in the aggregation group and such defined benefit plan is a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year, the percentage set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section shall be 5%. The
percentage referred to in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section shall be obtained by dividing the aggregate of contributions made pursuant to Article 4 and pursuant to any other defined contribution plan that is required to be
included in the aggregation group (other than a defined contribution plan that enables a defined benefit plan that is required to be included in such group to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code) during the Plan Year on behalf of such key
Employee by such key Employee s compensation for the Plan Year. Notwithstanding the above, the provisions of this Section 15.3 shall not apply for any Plan Year with respect to an Eligible Employee who has accrued the defined benefit
minimum provided under section 416 of the Code under a qualified defined benefit plan maintained by an Employer or Affiliate.   
   ARTICLE 16    
  AMENDMENT, ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATE PLAN AND TERMINATION       Section 16.1 .  Amendment .      The Company may at any time and from
time to time amend or modify the Plan by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Compensation Committee thereof;  provided , however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate
annual cost to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or   
         86   

modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result in an increase
in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater responsibility. No amendment shall be made in respect of Eligible Employees who are members of a bargaining unit
represented by IBEW Local Union 15 that is inconsistent with that portion of the collective bargaining agreement between such an Employer and IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan.   
   Section 16.2 .  Establishment of Separate Plan .   
  If an Employer withdraws from the Plan under Section 12.2 (relating to withdrawal from participation), the Administrator may
determine the portion of the Trust Fund held by the Trustee that is applicable to the Participants and former Participants of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate such portion in a separate Trust Fund. Such separate Trust Fund shall
thereafter be held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.      The portion of the Trust Fund applicable
to the Participants and former Participants of a particular Employer shall be the sum of:       

(a)  
  the total amount credited to all accounts that are applicable to the Participants and former Participants of such Employer and     

(b)  
  an amount that bears the same ratio to the excess, if any, of         

(i)  
  the total value of the Trust Fund over         

(ii)  
  the total amount credited to all accounts        as
the total amount credited to the accounts that are applicable to the Participants of such Employer bears to the total amount credited to such accounts of all Participants.       Section 16.3 .  Termination and Distributions upon Termination of the Plan .      The Company has established the Plan with the bona fide intention and expectation that contributions will be continued indefinitely, but the Company will not have any obligation or
  
         87   

liability whatsoever to maintain the Plan for any given length of time and may terminate the Plan at any time by resolution of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee thereof, to
that effect, without any liability whatsoever for any such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan shall not be terminated in respect of Eligible Employees who are members of a bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15
if such termination is inconsistent with the portion of the collective bargaining agreement between the Employer of such Eligible Employees and IBEW Local Union 15 concerning the Plan. The Plan will be deemed terminated: (a) if and when the
Company is judicially declared bankrupt, or (b) upon dissolution of the Company.      Upon termination of the Plan by the
Company or withdrawal from participation in the Plan by any Employer pursuant to Section 12.2 (relating to withdrawal from participation) or the partial termination of the Plan with respect to a group of Employees or complete discontinuance of
contributions hereunder, distributions shall be made to each affected Participant or other persons entitled to distributions pursuant to Article 8 (relating to withdrawals and distributions). If the entire Plan is terminating, upon the completion of
distribution to all Participants, the Trust will terminate, the Trustee will be relieved from all liability under the Trust, and no Participant or other person will have any claims thereunder, except as required by applicable law.   
  Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, no distribution shall be made to any Participant (i) until he or she
attains age 59   1   /  2   except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.3 (relating to distributions upon termination of employment) or (ii) if a successor plan, as defined in Regulations, is established or maintained by the Participant s Employer.    
  To the extent that no discrimination in value results, any distribution after termination or partial termination of the Plan may be made,
in whole or in part, in cash, in securities or other   
         88   

assets in kind, or in non-transferable annuity contracts, as the Administrator (in its discretion) may determine. All non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value at date of
distribution.      If the Internal Revenue Service refuses to issue an initial, favorable determination letter that the Plan and
Trust Fund as adopted by an Employer meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, the Employer may terminate its participation in the Plan and shall direct the
Trustee to pay and deliver the portion of the Trust Fund applicable to the Participants of such Employer, determined pursuant to Section 16.2 (relating to establishment of separate plan) to such Employer and such Employer shall pay to
Participants or their beneficiaries the part of such Employer s portion of the Trust Fund as is attributable to contributions made by Participants.      Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no distribution shall be made pursuant to this Section 16.3 (relating to termination and distribution upon termination of the Plan) solely
due to the termination of this Plan if, within the meaning of applicable Regulations, the employer establishes or maintains an alternative defined contribution plan.       Section 16.4 .  Trust Fund to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their Beneficiaries .      Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.5 (relating to the limitation on Employer contributions), 7.4 (relating to limitations on allocations imposed by section 415 of the Code) and 16.3
(relating to termination and distributions upon termination of the Plan), and any other provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for
the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries either by operation or termination of the Plan, power of amendment or other means.   
         89   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly
authorized officer on this                day of December, 2010.

(B) transferred employment from the Power Team to a participating business unit of an Employer during 2003 pursuant to Exelon Way, (ii) who became an Eligible Employee on January 1, 2004, (iii) who has an accrued benefit under
either the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, (iv) who is not described in the preceding sentence and (v) who did not previously make a valid election pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner
prescribed by the  Committee,  as such term was defined in the Plan prior to June 1, 2006, to either (A) resume or continue participation in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, as of January 1, 2004 or
(B) participate in the Plan as of January 1, 2004. Each such Eligible Employee who affirmatively elects to participate in the Plan in lieu of participation in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan shall become a Participant as of January, 1,
2004.      (c)  Transfer of Benefits and Assets to Plan . If an Employee described in paragraph (b) above elects to
participate in the Plan in lieu of participating in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be, the Employee s accrued benefit under either such plan, determined as of December 31, 2001, or December 31, 2003, as the case may
be, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable plan, shall be transferred to the Plan. An amount of assets that is equal to the present value of the Employee s accrued benefit described in the preceding sentence
  
         12   

determined using the methods and assumptions prescribed by section 4044 of ERISA shall also be transferred to the Plan. Such transfer of benefits and assets related thereto shall occur as soon as
practicable after the Eligible Employee makes the election described in paragraph (b) above. Each Participant whose benefits are so transferred shall be permitted to have his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit paid in any of the optional forms of
benefit listed in the applicable Schedule in lieu of the forms provided hereunder. The provisions set forth in the applicable Schedule shall govern all matters relating to a Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit.   
  In the event that an Eligible Employee whose accrued benefit under the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, and related assets, is transferred to
the Plan receives a Notice and has a Termination of Employment on or before December 31, 2002, the accrued benefit, and related assets, transferred to the Plan shall be transferred back to the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as the case may be,
and the amount of the pension benefit accrued by such Employee during 2002 (if any) shall be determined under the terms of the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as applicable, rather than the Plan. Such transfer shall occur as soon as administratively
practicable.      Section 3.2  Transfer to Affiliates . If a Participant is transferred from one Employer to another Employer
or from an Employer to an Affiliate that is not an Employer, then such transfer shall not terminate the Participant s participation in the Plan and the Participant shall continue to participate in the Plan until an event occurs that would have
entitled the Participant to a complete distribution of the Participant s vested Pension had the Participant continued to be employed by an Employer until the occurrence of such event. Nevertheless, except to the extent provided in Section 9.3
(relating to employment by related entities) or Section 9.7 (relating to change in employment status or transfer to affiliate), a Participant shall not be entitled to receive Service Credits under Section 6.1(c) (relating to Service
Credits) during any period of employment by   
         13   

any Affiliate that is not an Employer, and periods of employment with an Affiliate that is not an Employer shall be taken into account only to the extent set forth in Section 9.3 (relating
to employment by related entities) or Section 9.7 (relating to change in employment status or transfer to affiliate).   
  Section 3.3  Cessation of Participation . An individual s participation in the Plan shall cease upon the date the individual is
no longer eligible to receive a benefit from this Plan or upon the individual s Termination of Employment if the individual has not satisfied the Vesting Requirement upon the date of his or her Termination of Employment.   
  Section 3.4  Rehired Participants . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a Participant terminates
employment and is reemployed as an Employee under circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy regarding the rehiring of retirees, including that the
Participant waives participation in, or additional benefits and accruals under the Plan, such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any Service Credits under Section 6.1(c) (relating to Service Credits) during such period of
reemployment.       ARTICLE 4        SOURCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS       Section 4.1  Source of Contributions . The
Employers intend to make contributions to the Trust of amounts which, in the aggregate over a period of time, shall be sufficient to finance the benefits provided by the Plan. Any such contributions shall be in such amounts and shall be made in such
manner and at such time as the Company may from time to time determine in accordance with the funding policy it establishes and consistent with minimum funding standards under section 412 of the Code, provided, however, that all contributions made
by the Employers   
         14   

for any Plan Year shall be made prior to the due date, including extensions thereof, of the Employers  federal income tax return for the taxable year of the Employers which coincides with
such Plan Year. The Company may rely on the advice of actuaries in establishing and carrying out a funding policy. Forfeitures arising under the Plan for any reason shall be applied to reduce the cost of the Plan, not to increase the benefits
otherwise payable to the Participants.      Section 4.2  Limitation on Contributions . The contributions of an Employer for
any Plan Year shall not exceed the maximum amount for which a deduction is allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year of such Employer that ends with or within such Plan Year. Any contribution made by an Employer
by reason of a good faith mistake of fact, or the portion of any contribution made by an Employer that exceeds the maximum amount for which a deduction is currently allowable to such Employer for federal income tax purposes, shall upon the request
of such Employer be returned by the Trustee to the Employer. An Employer s request and the return of any such contribution must be made within one year after such contribution was mistakenly made or after the deduction of such excess portion of
such contribution was disallowed, as the case may be. The amount to be returned to an Employer pursuant to this Section shall be the excess of (i) the amount contributed over (ii) the amount that would have been contributed had there not
been a mistake of fact or the maximum amount that is so deductible, as the case may be. Earnings attributable to the mistaken contribution shall not be returned to the Employer, but losses attributable thereto shall reduce the amount to be so
returned.       ARTICLE 5        TRUST    
         15   

A trust (the  Trust ) has been created by the execution of a trust agreement
between the Company and a trustee (the  Trustee ) for purposes of holding and administering the assets of the Plan. All contributions under the Plan shall be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall hold all monies and other property
received by it and invest and reinvest the same, together with the income therefrom, on behalf of the Participants collectively in accordance with the provisions of such trust agreement. The Trustee shall make distributions from the Trust Fund at
such time or times to such person or persons and in such amounts as the Administrator directs in accordance with the Plan.   
   ARTICLE 6

of zero until credited with any Transition Credit, if applicable, or Service Credit as provided herein. Each such account shall be for accounting purposes only, and there shall be no segregation of assets among such accounts. A Participant s
Cash Balance Account shall cease to be maintained as of the Participant s Pension Starting Date (except to the extent such Pension Starting Date is required by Section 7.1(b) (relating to distributions to five percent owners)), in which
case the Participant s Cash Balance Account shall cease to be maintained as of the first January 1 following the Participant s Termination of Employment).      (b)  Transition Credit . A Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be credited, as of the first day of the Plan Year in which such Participant becomes a Participant, with an amount equal to the
Participant s Transition Credit, provided that (a) the Participant is an Employee on January 1, 2002 and becomes a Participant pursuant to Section 3.1(b) (relating to eligibility for
  
         16   

participation for employees who are not new hires) and (b) the Participant is not an employee of the Power Team. An Employee who becomes a Participant pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
(relating to eligibility for participation for new hires) shall not be credited with a Transition Credit at any time and a rehired Employee who becomes a Participant pursuant to Section 9.1 (relating to recommencement of employment by
terminated employee) shall not be credited with a Transition Credit at the time of his or her rehire.      (c)  Service
Credits . A Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be credited, as of the last day of each Plan Year during which the Participant is a Participant and an Eligible Employee, with an amount equal to the following percentage of Compensation

collective bargaining agreement that provides for participation in this Plan, for each Plan Year thereafter, 5.75%, and (ii) for each Plan Year beginning on and after January 1, 2008 if the Participant s employment is not subject to a
collective bargaining agreement, 7.00%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs other than on the last day of a Plan Year and if the Participant is entitled to have an amount credited to his or her Cash
Balance Account for such Plan Year pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount shall be credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account as of the last day of the month before such Pension Starting Date (and prior to the crediting of any
Investment Credit for such Plan Year). No amount shall be credited pursuant to this paragraph (c) to the Cash Balance Account of a Participant who is not rendering services to any Employer or Affiliate as a result of a disability, regardless of
whether such Participant is receiving benefits under any Employer s or Affiliate s long-term disability plan.   
         17   

(d)  Investment Credits . For each Plan Year beginning before January 1, 2008, a
Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be credited, as of the last day of each Plan Year during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year, with an amount equal to the
product of (i) the  Pre-2008 Plan Interest Rate  (as defined below) multiplied by (ii) the balance of such Participant s Cash Balance Account as of the first day of such Plan Year. For each Plan Year beginning on and after
January 1, 2008, such Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be credited, as of the last day of each Plan Year during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year,
with an amount equal to the sum of the following amounts: (i) the product of (A) the  Pre-2008 Plan Interest Rate  (as defined below) multiplied by (B) the balance of such Participant s Cash Balance Account as of
December 31, 2007, if any; and (ii) the product of (A) the  Post-2007 Plan Interest Rate  (as defined below) multiplied by (B) the portion of such Participant s Cash Balance Account attributable to Service Credits
credited after December 31, 2007, determined as of the first day of such Plan Year. A Participant who is not rendering Services to any Employer or Affiliate as a result of a disability with respect to which such Participant is receiving
benefits under any Employer s or Affiliate s long-term disability plan shall be credited with the amount described in the first and second sentences of this paragraph (d), as applicable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, if a
Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs other than on the last day of a Plan Year, the amount to be credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account pursuant to this paragraph (d) for the Plan Year in which the Participant s
Pension Starting Date occurs shall be equal to the product of (i) 4% (or, for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2008, the  Post-2007 Plan Interest Rate,  as defined below, for the immediately preceding Plan Year)
multiplied by (ii) a fraction,   
         18   

the numerator of which is the number of whole calendar months during such Plan Year prior to and including the month which contains the date immediately preceding the Participant s Pension
Starting Date and the denominator of which is twelve, and such Investment Credit shall be made as of the last day of the month before such Pension Starting Date prior to the crediting of any Service Credit for such year. Except to the extent
provided in Section 7.2(d)(2) (relating to special rules regarding pensions), a Participant s Cash Balance Account shall not be credited with Investment Credits after the Participant s Pension Starting Date.   
  For purposes of this Section, the  Pre-2008 Plan Interest Rate  for any Plan Year shall mean a percentage equal to the greater
of (i) 4% and (ii) the average of (A) the  applicable interest rate  as defined in section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the month of November of such Plan Year and (B) the annual percentage rate of return for the S P
500 Stock Index for the 12-month period ending on December 31 of such Plan Year, as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the succeeding year. For purposes of this Section, the  Post-2007 Plan Interest Rate 
for any Plan Year shall mean a percentage equal to the third segment rate of interest on long-term investment grade corporate bonds, as provided for in section 430(h)(2)(C)(iii) of the Code for the month of November of such Plan Year.   
  (e)  Additional Credit . If, as of a Participant s Pension Starting Date, the amount described in (1) below exceeds the
amount described in (2) below, an amount equal to the difference between such amounts shall be credited the Participant s Cash Balance Account as of the day before such Pension Starting Date:   
  (1) The cumulative amount that would have been credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account if the Plan Interest Rate
described in Section 6.1(d) of the Plan (relating to Investment Credits) were credited to the Participant s  Opening Credit  (as defined below) for   
         19   

each Plan Year during which the Participant is a Participant at the Plan Interest Rate then in effect, whether or not such Participant is an Eligible Employee during such Plan Year.   
  (2) The cumulative amount that would have been credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account if 6.5% interest were credited to
the Participant s  Opening Credit  (as defined below) for all Plan Years during which the Participant is a Participant, whether or not such Participant is an eligible Employee during such Plan Year.   
  If the amount described in (1) above is equal to or less than the amount described in (2) above, no amount shall be credited to
the Participant s Cash Balance Account pursuant to this paragraph (e). In addition, no amount shall be credited pursuant to this paragraph (e) if a Participant does not have an Accrued Frozen Benefit.   
  For purposes of this paragraph (e),  Opening Credit  shall mean an amount equal to the present value of a Participant s
Accrued Frozen Benefit determined as of December 31, 2001 using a 6.5% discount rate and the 1983 Group Annuity (unisex) Mortality Table (50% male, 50% female) assuming the Accrued Frozen Benefit otherwise payable at the Schedule A Retirement
Date would commence at the later of the Participant s attained age as of December 31, 2001 or age 60.       ARTICLE 7

permitted to commence distribution of such Participant s Cash Balance Account or Accrued    
         21   

Frozen Benefit at the time specified in the preceding sentence unless required by the Code or Regulations.      (c)  Immediate Distribution of Small Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if, as of the date of a Participant s Termination of Employment (including on account
of death), the aggregate of the balance of the Participant s Cash Balance Account and the lump sum Schedule Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit does not exceed $5,000 or, for distributions occurring on or after
March 28, 2005, $1,000, such Participant or, in the event of the Participant s death, such Participant s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, shall receive a distribution in the amount and in the form described in Option 2 of
Section 7.2(c) (relating to lump sum distribution) as soon as practicable following such Termination of Employment in satisfaction of all benefits to which the Participant or his or her Beneficiaries, as the case may be, is entitled under the
Plan.      (d)  Deemed Distributions . If a Participant has not satisfied the Vesting Requirement upon his or her Termination
of Employment, such Participant s vested interest in his or her benefit under the Plan shall have a value of zero, such Participant shall be deemed to have received immediately after such termination a lump sum distribution of such vested
interest and concurrent therewith shall forfeit all benefits hereunder, and the Participant s Cash Balance Account and Accrued Frozen Benefit shall no longer be maintained.

any,   
         22   

distributed in the form of a Pension for the life of the Participant unless the Participant elects an optional form of distribution described in paragraph (c) of this Section (relating to
optional forms of distributions) at the time and in the manner described in Section 7.4 (relating to election and waiver procedures).      (b)  Manner of Distribution With Respect to Married Participants . A Participant who is married on his or her Pension Starting Date shall have the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s

thereafter, if the Participant s Spouse survives the Participant, a Pension payable to the Spouse during the remaining lifetime of such Spouse equal to 50% of the Pension payable to the Participant during the Participant s lifetime.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Participant, with the consent of his or her Spouse, may elect an optional form of distribution described in paragraph (c) of this Section (relating to optional forms of distributions) at the time and

Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Benefit attributable to his or her Cash Balance Account and the Schedule Equivalent of his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit, if any.   
  (d)  Special Rules Regarding Pensions .      (1) If a Participant s spouse dies before the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the Participant has not elected an optional form of distribution described in paragraph (c) of this
Section (relating to optional forms of distribution), the Participant shall again be entitled to make an election under this Section.      (2) If a Pension commences pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (relating to distributions to five percent owners) while a Participant remains employed by an Employer, such Pension shall be actuarially
adjusted as of January 1 following the end of each calendar year during which such Participant remains employed by an Employer to reflect any additional Service Credits and Investment Credits credited to the Participant s Cash Balance
Account as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year.      (3) If a Participant elects Option 3 under
Section 7.2(c) and the Participant s Beneficiary is other than the Participant s Spouse, the Pension payable to the Participant and to the Beneficiary shall be adjusted as is necessary to satisfy the incidental benefit requirement
under section 401(a)(9) of the Code.      Section 7.3  Death Benefits . (a)  Eligibility . If a Participant who has
satisfied the Vesting Requirement dies prior to his or her Pension Starting Date, the Participant s surviving Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a benefit under this Section. In addition, if a Participant

benefit under this Section shall receive the following, as applicable:      (1)  Lump Sum Payment . Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.8 (relating to special rules applicable to calculations of lump sum distributions), a lump sum payment that is equal to the sum of (a) the balance credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account as
of the last day of the month immediately preceding the date of such distribution and (b) the lump sum Schedule Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be payable to the Participant s surviving Beneficiary not
later than the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death, except that if the Participant s surviving Beneficiary is the Participant s surviving Spouse, distribution to such surviving Spouse may commence at the same time as
described in subparagraph (2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any benefit be payable pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this Section 7.3(b) (relating to statutory surviving Spouse s benefit), the amount of any benefit payable
pursuant to this subparagraph (1) shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit payable pursuant to such subparagraph (2).   
  (2)  Statutory Surviving Spouse s Benefit . If the Participant is survived by a Spouse to
whom the Participant was married throughout the one-year period ending on the date of the Participant s death, then, unless such Participant has with his or her Spouse s consent waived the benefit described herein in the manner described
in Section 7.4(e) (relating to waiver of statutory surviving Spouse s benefit), such Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor s Pension commencing as of any January 1 coinciding with or following the date of the
Participant s death or any succeeding January 1 (but not later than the January 1 immediately preceding or coinciding with the date the Participant would have attained age 70-   1   /  2   had he or she survived) and continuing for the lifetime of such
Spouse in an amount equal to the Pension such Spouse would have received pursuant to a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if the Participant had survived until such day and such Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity had commenced on such day and
the Participant had died immediately after such annuity commenced, but determined without regard to any Service Credits that would have been credited to the Participant s Cash Balance Account with respect to any periods subsequent to the
Participant s Termination of Employment.       (c) The death benefits provided by this Section shall not be effective
to the extent required to comply with the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.   
         25   

Section 7.4  Election and Waiver Procedures . (a)  Election of Optional Form of
Benefit . Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section (relating to spousal consent to election of optional form of benefit or beneficiary designation), a Participant may elect, change or revoke any form of distribution provided under
Section 7.2 (relating to forms of distribution) at any time during the 90-day period ending on the later of the Participant s Pension Starting Date and the date the Participant s benefit is paid or commences. Such an election, change
or revocation shall be made by the Participant delivering a written notice describing the election, change or revocation to the Administrator on a form provided by the Administrator for this purpose.   
  (b)  Beneficiary Designation . Subject to paragraph (e) below (relating to waiver of statutory surviving spouse s
benefit), each Participant may designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(1) (relating to lump sum pre-retirement death benefit) in the event of his or her death. A Participant may from time to time,
without the consent of any Beneficiary, change or cancel any such designation. Such designation and each change therein shall be made in the form prescribed by the Administrator and shall be filed with the Administrator. If no Beneficiary has been
designated by a deceased Participant, or the designated Beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(1) (relating to lump sum pre-retirement death benefit) shall be made by the Trustee at the direction of
the Administrator (i) to the surviving Spouse of such deceased Participant, if any, or (ii) if there shall be no surviving Spouse, to the surviving children of such deceased Participant, if any, in equal shares, or (iii) if there
shall be no surviving Spouse or surviving children, to the executor or administrator of the estate of such deceased Participant, or (iv) if no executor or administrator shall have been appointed for the estate of such deceased Participant
within six months following the date of the Participant s death, in equal shares to the person or persons who   
         26   

would be entitled under the intestate succession laws of the state of the Participant s domicile to receive the Participant s personal estate. The marriage of a Participant shall be
deemed to revoke any prior designation of a Beneficiary made by him or her and a divorce shall be deemed to revoke any prior designation of the Participant s divorced Spouse if written evidence of such marriage or divorce shall be received by
the Administrator before distribution shall have been made in accordance with such designation. If, within a period of three years following any Participant s death or other termination of employment by an Employer, the Administrator in the
exercise of reasonable diligence has been unable to locate the person or persons entitled to benefits under this Article in respect of such Participant, the rights of such person or persons shall be forfeited and the Administrator shall direct the
Trustee to pay such benefit or benefits to the person or persons next entitled thereto under the succession prescribed by this Section.      (c)  Spousal Consent to Election of Optional Form of Benefit or Beneficiary Designation . If a Participant is married on his or her Pension Starting Date, and if after giving effect to an election,
revocation or change described in paragraph (a) of this Section (relating to election of optional form of benefit) the Participant s Spouse would not be entitled to receive a survivor s benefit at least equal to that provided by
Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants), such election, revocation or change shall not be effective unless it shall have been consented to at the time of such election, revocation or change in
writing by the Participant s Spouse and such consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a notary public. The consent of a Spouse to such an election, revocation or change shall not be required if it is established to
the satisfaction of the Administrator that such consent cannot be obtained because there is no Spouse, the Spouse cannot be located or such other circumstances as may be prescribed in Regulations. If the Spouse is legally incompetent to
  
         27   

give consent, the consent may be executed by the Spouse s legal guardian (including the Participant, if the Participant is the legal guardian). An election of an optional form of
distribution shall be deemed a rejection of the distribution form provided by paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 7.2 (relating to manner of distribution with respect to unmarried Participants and manner of distribution with respect to
married Participants). The consent of a Spouse otherwise required by this paragraph shall not be necessary for a distribution required by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.      (d)  Notice of Availability of Optional Forms of Benefit . No less than 30 days (or such shorter period as may be permitted by applicable law) and no more than 90 days before the later of a
Participant s Pension Starting Date and the date the Participant s benefit is paid or commences, the Administrator shall give the Participant by mail or personal delivery written notice in non-technical language that he or she may elect an
optional form of distribution set forth in Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution); provided, however, that the Participant may waive (with applicable spousal consent) such 30-day notice period as long as the Participant s
distribution commences not less than eight days after such notice is provided. Such notice shall include a general description of the eligibility conditions and other material features of the optional forms of distribution provided under the Plan;
the circumstances under which the basic forms of distribution set forth in Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution) will be provided unless a Participant, with the consent of the Participant s Spouse, elects otherwise; the
Participant s right to revoke any such election; and information regarding the financial effect, in terms of dollars per payment, upon his or her distribution if he or she elects an optional form of distribution or revokes any prior election.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice described in the previous paragraph may be provided to the Participant subsequent to the Participant s   
         28   

Pension Starting Date, if the Participant so elects, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:      (i) the date on which the first payment to be received by the Participant is made (the  initial payment date ) shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date that the notice
is furnished to the Participant, except that the initial payment date may be as early as the eighth day after such notice is provided if (i) such notice clearly indicates that the Participant has a right to a period of thirty (30) days
after receiving the notice to consider to waive the basic forms of distribution provided under the Plan and to elect (with spousal consent) an optional form of benefit, (ii) the Participant affirmatively elects a form of distribution with the
consent of his or her spouse (if required) to commence as of the initial payment date, and (iii) the Participant is permitted to revoke such election until the initial payment date;   
  (ii) the notice shall be provided to the Participant no more than ninety (90) days before the initial payment date,
however, the Plan will not fail to satisfy the ninety (90)-day requirement if the delay in providing the distribution is due solely to an administrative delay;      (iii) the Participant is not permitted to elect a Pension Starting Date that precedes the date upon which the Participant could have otherwise started receiving benefits under the terms of the Plan as in
effect on the Pension Starting Date;      (iv) to the extent that a Participant has not received any payments for
the period from the Pension Starting Date to the initial payment date, the Participant shall receive a one-time payment to reflect any such missed payments (a  make-up payment ). Such make-up payment shall be adjusted for interest from the
period beginning on the Pension Starting Date and ending on the initial payment date, which shall be calculated with respect to such payments that would have been received prior to the initial payment date. The interest rate used to compute the
adjustment described in the preceding sentence shall equal the 30 Year Treasury rate for December of the preceding Plan Year. For purposes of Section 8.1 (relating to statutory limits), the limitations set forth therein shall comply with the
adjustments required thereto pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.417(e)-1 with respect to any Pension Starting Date described in this paragraph which is a  retroactive annuity starting date  as defined for purposes of such Regulation; and
     (v) if a Participant who is married elects to commence the Participant s benefit as of the initial
payment date pursuant to this paragraph, then the Participant s spouse (including an alternate payee who is treated as the Participant s spouse under a qualified domestic relations order), determined as of the initial payment date, must
consent to such election if the survivor benefits   
         29   

payable as of the Pension Starting Date are less than the survivor benefits payable under the benefit described in Option 3 of Section 7.2(b) of the Plan as of the initial payment date.
     (e)  Waiver of Statutory Surviving Spouse s Benefit . A Participant may waive the statutory surviving spouse s
benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2) at any time prior to the Participant s death, provided, however, that if such waiver is made prior to the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35, such waiver shall become invalid on the
first day of such year unless the Participant has terminated employment by the Employers prior to such day. A Participant whose waiver becomes invalid pursuant to the preceding sentence may elect, at any time after the waiver becomes invalid, to
again waive the statutory surviving spouse s benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2). A waiver made pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be made by delivering a written notice thereof to the Administrator on a form provided by the
Administrator for this purpose with a written consent of the Participant s Spouse which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section (relating to beneficiary designation) (unless it is determined pursuant to paragraph
(c) of this Section that such consent is not needed). Such a waiver shall cease to be effective if, subsequent to the execution of such waiver, the Participant shall make any other Beneficiary designation pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section (relating to beneficiary designation) which diminishes the rights or contingent rights of the Participant s Spouse, which are specified in the Beneficiary designation in effect at the time such Spouse consented to such waiver, to all or
part of the benefit provided under Section 7.3(b) (relating to form of payment of pre-retirement death benefits), provided, however, that in no event shall such other Beneficiary designation affect the effectiveness of such waiver if such
Spouse shall have so specified at the time of consent. A waiver described in this paragraph shall cease to be effective on (i) the date on which the Participant is subsequently married to a person other than the Spouse
  
         30   

who consented to such waiver, (ii) the Participant s Pension Starting Date, or (iii) the date of the Participant s revocation of such waiver.   
  (f)  Notice of Right to Waive Statutory Surviving Spouse s Benefit . Not later than twelve months after the day on which an
Employee has become a Participant, the Administrator shall give the Participant by mail or personal delivery written notice in nontechnical language that he or she may waive the statutory surviving spouse s benefit provided by
Section 7.3(b)(2). Such notice shall include a general description of terms and conditions of such benefit and the circumstances under which it will be provided unless waived and the Participant s right to revoke any such waiver and
general information on the relative financial effect, if any, upon the Participant s Pension of such benefit and its waiver. Such notice shall also advise the Participant that, upon written request to the Administrator prior to the end of the
waiver period set forth in paragraph (e) of this Section (relating to waiver of statutory surviving spouse s benefit), he or she will be given a written explanation in nontechnical language of the terms and conditions of such benefit and
the financial effect, in terms of dollars per payment, upon his or her other death benefits if he or she does not waive such benefit. Such explanation shall be mailed or personally delivered to the Participant within 30 days from the date his or her
written request is received by the Administrator.      (g)  Election of Optional Form of Statutory Surviving Spouse s
Benefit . A surviving Spouse may elect to have the statutory surviving spouse s benefit provided by Section 7.3(b)(2) payable in the form of Option 2 of Section 7.2(c) (relating to optional forms of distribution). Such an election
may be made at any time prior to the commencement of such benefit and not thereafter. Such an election shall be made by delivering a written notice thereof to the Administrator on a form provided by the Administrator for this purpose.   
         31   

(h)  Automatic Cancellation of Elections . If a Participant s Pension is payable
in the form of a joint and survivor annuity and if, prior to the Participant s Pension Starting Date, the Participant s Spouse dies or the Participant and such Spouse divorce, the Participant s election or deemed election to receive a
joint and survivor annuity shall, upon the Participant s notice to the Administrator of such death or divorce, be automatically cancelled, unless, subsequent to such Spouse s death or the Participant s divorce and prior to the
Participant s Pension Starting Date, the Participant remarries and notice of such new marriage is timely received by the Administrator.      Section 7.5  Distributions to Minor and Disabled Distributees . Any distribution under this Article that is payable to a distributee who is a minor or to a distributee who, in the opinion of the
Administrator, is unable to manage his or her affairs by reason of illness or mental incompetency may be made to or for the benefit of any such distributee at such time consistent with the provisions of Section 7.2 (relating to form of
distribution) and in such of the following ways as the legal representative of such distributee shall direct: (i) directly to any such minor distributee if, in the opinion of such legal representative, he or she is able to manage his or her
affairs, (ii) to such legal representative, (iii) to a custodian under a Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for any such minor distributee, or (iv) directly in payment of expenses of support or maintenance of such person. Neither the
Administrator nor the Trustee shall be required to see to the application by any third party other than the legal representative of a distributee of any distribution made to or for the benefit of such distributee pursuant to this Section.
     Section 7.6  Direct Rollover Distributions . In the case of a distribution under this Plan that is an  eligible
rollover distribution  within the meaning of section 402 of the Code and that is at least $200, an eligible distributee (as defined below) may elect that all or any portion of   
         32   

such distribution to which such eligible distributee is entitled shall be directly transferred as a rollover contribution from the Plan to (i) an individual retirement account described in
section 408(a) of the Code, (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, (iii) an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, (iv) a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the

permit the acceptance of rollover contributions) or (vii) effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code; provided, however, that (x) with respect to a plan described in clause (vii), for transfers
occurring before January 1, 2010, the Participant (or surviving spouse of a Participant or a former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) of the Code) meets the requirements of
section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the Code and (y) with respect to a distribution (or portion of a distribution) to a person who is not the Participant or the surviving spouse or former spouse of the Participant,  eligible retirement plan 
shall mean only a plan described in clause (i), (ii) or (vii) that, in either case, is established for the purpose of receiving such distribution on behalf of such person. For purposes of this Section,  eligible distributee 
shall include the Participant, his or her spouse or his or her former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code and, effective January 1, 2010, the
Participant s Beneficiary who is not the Participant s spouse or former spouse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an eligible distributee shall not be entitled to elect to have less than the total amount of such distribution transferred as a
rollover contribution unless the amount to be transferred equals at least $500.   
         33   

Section 7.7  Withholding Requirements . Any benefit payment made under the Plan will
be subject to any applicable income tax withholding requirements.      Section 7.8  Special Rules Applicable to Calculations of
Lump Sum Distributions . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a lump sum distribution is paid to a Participant prior to the Participant s Normal Retirement Age and prior to May 23, 2007, the portion of any lump
sum payment made under Section 7.2(c), Option 2, or Section 7.3(b)(1) that, in either case, is attributable to the Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be the greater of (x) the balance credited to the Participant s Cash
Balance Account as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the date of such distribution and (y) the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Benefit.   
  Section 7.9  Participant s Death During Qualified Military Service . Effective January 1, 2007, in the case of a
Participant who dies while performing Military Service, the Beneficiaries of such Participant shall be entitled to any additional benefits, if any (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of Military Service), provided under the Plan had
the Participant resumed employment with an Employer and then terminated such employment on account of such Participant s death.       ARTICLE 8        LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS    
  Section 8.1  Statutory Limits . The provisions of this Section shall be effective for any  Limitation Year  (as defined
below) solely to the extent required by the Code or Regulations for such year.   
         34   

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the amount of the
Participant s annual benefit (as defined below) accrued, distributable or payable at any time under the Plan shall be limited to an amount such that such annual benefit and the aggregate annual benefit of the Participant under all other defined
benefit plans maintained by the Employer or any other Affiliate does not exceed the lesser of:      (i) $160,000
(as increased to reflect the cost of living adjustments provided under section 415(d) of the Code), multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the Participant s years of participation (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(g)(1)(ii)) and the denominator of which is 10; or      (ii)
an amount equal to 100% of the Participant s average compensation for the three consecutive calendar years in which his or her compensation was the highest (as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(a)(5)) and
which are included in his or her years of service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii)) with the Employers multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th), the numerator of which is the
Participant s years of service and the denominator of which is 10.      The dollar amount set forth in clause (i) of the
preceding paragraph shall be actuarially reduced in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(d) if the Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs prior to the Participant s attainment of age 62. If the Participant s
Pension Starting Date occurs after the Participant attains age 65, such dollar amount shall be actuarially increased in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(e).   
  A Participant s  annual benefit  shall mean the Participant s accrued benefit payable annually in the form of a
straight life annuity, as determined in, and accordance with, Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(b). If the annual benefit is payable in a form other than a single life annuity, the annual benefit shall be adjusted to the Actuarial Equivalent of

         35   

shall be required for survivor benefits payable to a surviving Spouse under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (as described in Section 7.2(b)) to the extent such benefits would not be
payable if the Participant s annual benefit were paid in another form.      Effective for Plan Years beginning

specified under subdivision (3) of Article 2 (relating to definition of Actuarial Equivalent) as in effect and (ii) the amount computed using an interest rate assumption of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table under Treasury Regulation
section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the  Applicable Mortality Table ). Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall
be the greatest of (i) the amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified under subdivision (3) of Article 2 (relating to definition of Actuarial Equivalent) as in effect, (ii) the amount computed using an
interest rate assumption of 5.5% and the Applicable Mortality Table and (iii) the amount computed using the applicable interest rate under Treasury Regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the Applicable Mortality Table, divided by 1.05.
Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, for any form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, a Participant s annual benefit shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation section
1.415(b)-1(c). An individual s  annual benefit  under any other defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer and Affiliate shall be as determined pursuant to the provisions of section 415 of the Code and the Regulations issued

         36   

contribution plan maintained by any Employer and whose annual benefit under the Plan does not exceed $10,000 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding 1 and not less than 1/10th) the numerator of
which is the Participant s years of service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(g)(2)(ii))) and the denominator of which is 10.      For purposes of this Section, the term  compensation  shall have the meaning set forth in section 415(c)(3) of the Code and the applicable Regulations, the term  defined contribution
plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-1(a)(2), the term  defined benefit plan  shall have the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(a)(2) and the term  Employer 
shall include the Employers and all corporations and entities required to be aggregated with any of the Employers pursuant to section 414(b) and (c) of the Code as modified by section 415(h) of the Code.

present value of the Benefits payable to or on behalf of the Participant under the Plan does not exceed $5,000 (or such greater amount as may be set forth in section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code).   
  (c)  Plan Termination Rule . In the event of termination of the Plan, the benefit of any Participant in the Restricted Group shall

     (iii) The  current liability  of the Plan as of any date may be based on the current liability
reported on Schedule B of the Plan s most recent, timely-filed Form 5500 or 5500 C/R. For purposes of this Section, the value of the Plan s assets shall be determined on the same date as of which the current liability is determined.

set forth in subparagraph (b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) above is satisfied, (ii) the Participant is not in the Restricted Group, (iii) the Plan is terminated and the benefit received by
  
         38   

the Participant is nondiscriminatory or (iv) such restrictions are not required to be applied to such payment under the Code or Regulations.   
  Section 8.3  Benefit Restrictions as a Result of Funding . (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
following benefit restrictions shall apply if the Plan s  Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage  (the  AFTAP ), as defined in section 436(j) of the Code, is at or below the following levels.   
  (i) If the Plan s AFTAP is 60% or greater but less than 80% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall not pay any prohibited
payment (as defined in subparagraph (a)(iv) below) after the valuation date for the Plan Year to the extent the amount of the payment exceeds the lesser of (x) 50% of the amount of the payment which could be made without regard to the
restrictions under this Section and (y) the present value (determined pursuant to guidance prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, using the interest and mortality assumptions under section 417(e) of the Code) of the maximum
guarantee with respect to the Participant under section 4022 of ERISA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, only one such prohibited payment may be made with respect to any Participant during any period of consecutive Plan Years to which the
limitations under either clause (x) or (y) of the preceding sentence apply. For purposes of this subparagraph, a Participant, his or her Beneficiary and any alternate payee (as defined in section 414(p)(8) of the Code) shall be deemed a
single  Participant.       (ii) If the Plan s AFTAP is less than 60% for a Plan Year, the Plan shall
not pay any prohibited payment after the valuation date for the Plan Year.      (iii) During any period in which
the Company is a debtor in a case under Title 11, United States Code (or similar federal or state law), the Plan shall not make any prohibited payment. The preceding sentence shall not apply on or after the date on which the Plan s enrolled
actuary certifies that the AFTAP is not less than 100%.      (iv) For purposes of this subparagraph (a), the term
 prohibited payment  means (x) any payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any social security supplements payable with respect to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit), to a
Participant or Beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in section 417(f)(2) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) occurs during any period a limitation under subparagraph (a)(ii) or (iii) is in effect, (y) any
payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or (z) any other payment specified by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations.   
         39   

(b) In any Plan Year in which the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60%,
benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the valuation date for the Plan Year. This restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company or the Employers
of a contribution (in addition to any minimum required contribution under section 430 of the Code) equal to the amount sufficient to result in an AFTAP of 60%.      (c) No amendment which has the effect of increasing Plan liabilities by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accruals or the rate at which benefits
become nonforfeitable shall take effect during any Plan Year if the Plan s AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 80% or would be less than 80% after taking into account such amendment; provided, however, that the preceding restriction shall not
apply to an amendment which provides for an increase in benefits under a formula which is not based on a Participant s compensation if the rate of such increase is not in excess of the contemporaneous rate of increase in average wages of
Participants covered by the amendment; and provided, further, that such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment), upon payment
by the Company or the Employers of a contribution as described in section 436(c)(2) of the Code.      (d) The Plan shall not
provide an unpredictable contingent event benefit payable with respect to any event occurring during any Plan Year if the AFTAP for such Plan Year is less than 60% or would be less than 60% after taking into account such occurrence; provided,
however, such restriction shall cease to apply with respect to any Plan Year, effective as of the first day of the Plan Year, upon payment by the Company or the Employers of a contribution as described in section 436(b)(2) of the Code. For purposes
of this subparagraph (d), the term  unpredictable   
         40   

contingent event benefit  means any benefit payable solely by reason of a plant shutdown (or similar event, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury), or any event other than the
attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or occurrence of death or disability.      (e) To avoid benefit restrictions, the Company may take any action permitted by section 436 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.   
  (f) The provisions of this Section are intended to comply with section 436 of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and
shall be construed to comply therewith.       ARTICLE 9    
   SPECIAL PARTICIPATION AND DISTRIBUTION RULES        RELATING TO RECOMMENCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND        EMPLOYMENT BY RELATED
ENTITIES       Section 9.1  Recommencement of Employment by a Terminated Employee . (a)  Rehire Date Before Absence
of 5 Years . If an Employee who has a Termination of Employment recommences employment with an Employer before having a Period of Severance of five years and, on the date of his or her rehire, the terms of such Employee s employment are not
subject to a collective bargaining agreement that does not provide for participation in this Plan, then either: (1) if such Employee was a Participant on the date his or her employment terminated, such Employee shall be Participant in the Plan
as of his or her rehire date if he or she is then an Eligible Employee or (2) if such Employee was not a Participant on the date his or her employment terminated, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a
Participant. Notwithstanding clause (1) of the preceding sentence, if an Employee described in the preceding sentence who first became an employed by an Employer prior to January 1, 2001 was not at any time permitted to make the election
described in Section 3.1(b) (relating to   
         41   

eligibility for participation for employees who are not new hires) or was permitted to make such election and elected to participate in the Plan but such election was not given effect as a result
of such Employee s Termination of Employment, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his or her rehire date or
(2) participate in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as applicable, at the time prescribed therein and have his or her accrued benefit under the ComEd Plan or PECO Plan, as applicable, and related assets transferred to the Plan in the manner

Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit and (b) such Employee shall not be entitled to a Transition Credit.      (b)
 Rehire Date After Absence of at Least 5 Years . If a Participant who has a vested benefit under the Plan has a Termination of Employment and thereafter is rehired by an Employer, such Participant shall remain a Participant upon his or her
rehire. If an Employee who has a Termination of Employment did not have a vested benefit under the Plan or under either the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan recommences employment with an Employer after having a Period of Severance of at least five
years, such Employee shall become a Participant as of the date of his or her rehire if he or she is then an Eligible Employee. If an Employee who has a Termination of Employment had a vested benefit under either the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan
recommences employment with an Employer after having a Period of Severance of at least five years, such Employee shall not be an Eligible Employee and shall not become a Participant upon such recommencement of employment. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if an Employee described in the preceding sentence who first became employed by an Employer prior   
         42   

to January 1, 2001 was not at any time permitted to make the election described in Section 3.1(b) (relating to eligibility for participation for employees who are not new hires) or was
permitted to make such election and elected to participate in the Plan but such election was not given effect as a result of such Employee s Termination of Employment, such Eligible Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner
prescribed by the Administrator, to either (1) participate in the Plan as of his or her rehire date or (2) participate in the ComEd Plan or the PECO Plan, as applicable, at the time prescribed therein and have his or her accrued benefit

Participant s Cash Balance Account shall be reinstated and credited with Investment Credits for the Participant s Period of Severance. If a Participant whose Termination of Employment occurs after his or her satisfaction of the Vesting
Requirement receives a complete distribution of his or her benefit under the Plan and subsequently recommences employment with an Employer as an Employee and becomes a Participant pursuant to paragraph (b) above, a new Cash Balance Account
shall be established for such Participant as of such recommencement of employment. Such new Cash Balance

Account shall have an initial balance of zero and shall be credited with Service Credits and Investment Credits solely for the Participant s period of employment thereafter.   
  Section 9.2  Suspension of Benefits . (a)  Generally . If a Participant continues employment by an Employer beyond the
Participant s Normal Retirement Age or, except as provided in paragraph (b) below, if a former Employee again becomes an Employee after his or her Normal Retirement Age, such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any Pension during
such employment. If such a Participant was receiving a Pension, the Participant s Cash Balance Account as of his or her Pension Starting Date shall be restored and thereafter credited with Service Credits and Investment Credits with respect to
such period of employment and Investment Credits from the Participant s prior Pension Starting Date to the date the Participant s Cash Balance Account is so restored. Upon the Participant s Termination of Employment or subsequent
Termination of Employment, as the case may be, the Participant s Accrued Benefit shall be the larger of (i) the Participant s Accrued Benefit as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the Participant s
date of rehire, or Normal Retirement Age, as the case may be, actuarially increased to reflect the later termination date (for purposes of this clause (i), the Investment Credits described in Section 6.1(d) with respect to such period of
employment shall be the actuarial increase to the Participant s Accrued Benefit), and (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant s Cash Balance Account, and the Accrued Frozen Benefit, as of the Participant s Termination of
Employment, or subsequent Termination of Employment, as the case may be, reduced in either case by the sum of any Pension previously paid to the Participant plus interest thereon at the rate described in subdivision (3) of Article 2 (relating
to definition of Actuarial Equivalent).   
         44

Continue . Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, a reemployed Participant who is employed under circumstances that satisfy the applicable conditions for continuation of payment of retirement benefits set forth in the Company s policy
regarding the rehiring of retirees shall not have his or her Pension suspended under this Section nor shall such reemployed Participant be prohibited from commencing his or her Pension if he or she is otherwise eligible to commence such Pension.
     Section 9.3  Employment by Related Entities . If an individual is employed by an entity that is an Affiliate, then any
period of employment by such entity (but only after such entity became an Affiliate) shall be taken into account solely for the purpose of determining when or whether and when such individual is eligible to participate in the Plan under Article 3
(relating to eligibility), measuring such individual s years of Vesting Service for purposes of the Vesting Requirement and determining when such individual s Termination of Employment occurs for purposes of Article 7 (relating to
distributions) to the same extent such period would have been taken into account had such employment been with an Employer.

414(n)(2) of the Code) of an Affiliate becomes an Employee, or if an Employee becomes such a leased employee, then any period as a leased employee shall be taken into account solely for the purposes of determining whether and when such individual is
eligible to participate in the Plan under Article 3 (relating to eligibility), measuring such individual s years of Vesting Service for purposes of the Vesting Requirement and determining when such individual s Termination of Employment
occurs for purposes of Article 7 (relating to distributions) to the same extent such period would have been taken into   
         45   

account had such service or employment been with an Employer. In addition, any contributions or benefits provided under another plan to such leased employee by his or her leasing organization
shall be treated as provided under this Plan and shall be taken into account under Section 8.1 (relating to statutory limits) to the extent required under Treasury Regulation section 1.415(a)-1(f)(3). This Section shall not apply to any period
during which such a leased employee was covered by a plan described in section 414(n)(5) of the Code and leased employees do not constitute more than 20% of the Employer s nonhighly compensated work force. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentences, an individual who performed services only as a leased employee prior to January 1, 2001 shall be treated as not performing an Hour of Service prior to January 1, 2001 solely for the purposes of determining whether such
individual qualifies as an Eligible Employee under subdivision (15) of Article 2.      Section 9.5  Employees who Become
Eligible Employees as a Result of Ceasing to be Represented by IBEW Local Union 15 . If an Employee who, on the day he or she first performed an Hour of Service with an Employer, was a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW
Local Union 15 and who first became employed by an Employer prior January 1, 2001 later ceases to be a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, such Employee shall be permitted to elect, in the time and manner
prescribed by the Administrator, to either (a) continue to participate in the ComEd Plan or (b) participate in this Plan as of the date he or she ceases to be a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 and
have his or her accrued benefit under the ComEd Plan and related assets transferred to the Plan in the manner described in Section 3.1(c) (relating to transfer of benefits and assets to Plan). If an Employee who, on the day he or she first
performed an Hour of Service with an Employer, was a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW   
         46   

Local Union 15 and who first became employed by an Employer on or after January 1, 2001 and participated in the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees later becomes an
Eligible Employee as a result of ceasing to be a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, such Employee shall become a Participant as of the date he or she ceases to be a member of a collective bargaining unit
represented by IBEW Local Union 15 and shall have his or her accrued benefit under the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees and related assets transferred to the Plan. If an Employee who, on the day he or she first performed
an Hour of Service with an Employer, was a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 and who first became employed by an Employer on or after January 1, 2001 and who was a participant in the Commonwealth Edison
Company Service Annuity System later becomes a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15, such Employee shall not become a Participant in this Plan.   
  Section 9.6  Employees who Cease to be Eligible Employees as a Result of Becoming Represented by IBEW Local Union 15 . If an
Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee as a result of becoming a member of a collective bargaining unit represented by IBEW Local Union 15 and becomes a participant in the Exelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees or the
Commonwealth Edison Company Service Annuity System, such Employee shall have his or her accrued benefit under this Plan and related assets transferred to the applicable plan.      Section 9.7  Change in Employment Status or Transfer to Affiliate . Except as otherwise provided herein, if an Employee who was a Participant transfers employment to or is reemployed by an Employer
or an Affiliate in a job classification with respect to which similarly situated   
         47   

employees of such Employer or Affiliate are not eligible to participate in the Plan but are instead either eligible to participate in another plan maintained by such Employer or Affiliate or are
not eligible to participate in any plan, then such individual shall upon such transfer or reemployment participate in the plan, if any, determined pursuant to rules established by the Company, which rules may be set forth in a Supplement hereto.

such successor entity may be substituted for the Employer under the Plan by adopting the Plan and becoming a party to the Trust agreement. If, within 90 days following the effective date of any such reorganization, such successor entity shall not

         60   

Section 13.2  Non-Assignability . (a)  In General . It is a condition of the

Participant s Accrued Benefit under the Plan, or any portion thereof, shall be the subject of one or more Qualified Domestic Relations Orders, such Accrued Benefit or portion thereof shall be paid to the person and at the time and in the manner
specified in any such order. The Administrator or its agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether any order constitutes a Qualified Domestic Relations Order under this paragraph (b). A domestic relations order shall not fail to constitute

terms of such order.      Section 13.3  Employment Non-Contractual . Neither this Plan nor any action taken by the
Administrator or the Investment Fiduciary confers any right upon an Employee to continue in employment with any Employer.

Plan.      Section 13.5  Merger or Consolidation with Another Plan . A merger or consolidation with, or transfer of assets or
liabilities to, any other plan shall not be effected unless the terms of such merger, consolidation or transfer are such that each Participant, distributee, Beneficiary or other person entitled to receive benefits from the Plan would, if the Plan
were to terminate immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer, receive a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit such person would be entitled to receive if the Plan were to terminate immediately before the merger, consolidation, or

   ARTICLE 14    
   TOP-HEAVY PLAN REQUIREMENTS       Section 14.1  Top-Heavy Plan Determination . If as of the determination date (as hereinafter defined) for any Plan Year the aggregate present value of (i) the accrued benefits under the Plan and
under all other defined benefit plans in the aggregate group (as hereinafter defined) and (ii) the aggregate account balances under all defined contribution plans in such aggregation group, in each case with respect to all participants in such
plans who are key employees (as defined in section 416(i) of the Code) for such Plan Year, exceeds 60% of the aggregate present value of accrued benefits and the account balances of all participants in all such plans as of the determination date,
then the Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for such Plan Year and the requirements of Sections 14.3 (relating to minimum benefits for top-heavy years) and 14.4 (relating to top-heavy vesting requirements) shall be applicable for such Plan Year as of
the first day thereof. If the Plan shall be a top-heavy plan for any Plan Year, such requirements   
         65   

shall not be applicable for such subsequent Plan Year except to the extent provided in Section 14.3 (relating to minimum benefits for top-heavy years).   
  Section 14.2  Definitions and Special Rules . (a)  Definitions . For purposes of this Article, the following definitions
shall apply:      (i)  Determination Date . The determination date for all plans in the aggregation group
shall be the last day of the preceding plan year, and the valuation date applicable to a determination date shall be (a) in the case of a defined contribution plan, the date as of which account balances are determined that is coinciding with or
immediately precedes the determination date, and (b) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the date as of which the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan year that includes the determination date is prepared, except that if any such
plan specifies a different determination or valuation date, such different date shall be used with respect to such plan.      (ii)  Aggregation Group . The aggregation group shall consist of (a) each plan of an Employer in which a key employee is a participant, (b) each other plan that enables such a plan to be
qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, and (c) any other plans of an Employer that the Company designates as part of the aggregation group.      (iii)  Key Employee . Key employee shall have the meaning set forth in section 416(i) of the Code.      (iv)  Top-Heavy Compensation . Top-heavy compensation shall have the meaning set forth in section 1.415(c)-2 of the Treasury Regulations.   
  (b)  Special Rules . For the purpose of determining the accrued benefit or account balance of a participant, the accrued benefit or
account balance of any person who has not been actively at work with an Employer at any time during the one-year period ending on the determination date shall not be taken into account pursuant to this Section, and any person who received a
distribution from a plan (including a plan that has terminated) in the aggregation group during the one-year period ending on the determination date shall be treated as a participant in such plan, and any such distribution shall be included in such
participant s account balance or accrued benefit, as the case may be;  provided ,  however , that in the case of a   
         66   

distribution made for a reason other than a Participant s severance from employment, death or disability, this sentence shall be applied by substituting  five-year period  for
 one-year period .      Section 14.3  Minimum Benefit for Top-Heavy Years . (a) The Pension to which a
Participant is entitled at Normal Retirement Age under Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution) shall in no event be less than two percent of the Participant s highest average compensation (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the
number of the Participant s years of Vesting Service, determined as provided below, not in excess of ten. For purposes of this Section, (i) a Participant s years of Vesting Service shall mean his or her years of Vesting Service but
excluding any year of Vesting Service completed in a Plan Year for which the Plan was not a top-heavy plan, and (ii) a Participant s highest average compensation shall be the annual average of his or her top heavy compensation for the
period of consecutive calendar years not exceeding 5 during which the Participant s top heavy compensation was the greatest, except that calendar years after the last Plan Year for which the Plan was top-heavy shall be disregarded.   
  (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section shall not apply with respect to a Participant if, for each year in which the
Plan is a top-heavy plan, (i) the eligible employee s Employer also maintains a defined contribution plan which is included in the aggregation group for such year and (ii) under such plan, contributions made and forfeitures allocated
to each eligible employee (other than key employees) equal 5% of such Participant s top heavy compensation for each Plan Year the Plan is top-heavy.

the Code and after the Participant shall have completed at least three years of   
         67   

Vesting Service, the Participant shall be deemed to have satisfied the Vesting Requirement and shall be entitled to the Pension described in Section 7.2 (relating to form of distribution).
      ARTICLE 15        AMENDMENT, ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATE        PLAN AND TERMINATION
      Section 15.1  Amendment . The board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) may at any time and from
time to time amend or modify this Plan in any manner deemed by the board of directors of the Company to be necessary or desirable, provided, however, that in the case of any amendment or modification that would not result in an aggregate annual cost
to the Company of more than $50,000,000, the Plan may be amended or modified by action of the Chief Human Resources Officer (with the consent of the Chief Executive Officer in the case of a discretionary amendment or modification expected to result
in an increase in annual expense or liability account balance exceeding $250,000) or another executive officer holding title of equivalent or greater. Any such amendment or modification shall become effective on such date as the board (or committee
thereof) or executive shall determine and may apply to Participants in this Plan at the time thereof as well as to future Participants, provided, however, that, unless permitted by applicable law, no such amendment or modification which reduces the
basis for the computation of Pensions shall be retroactive as to service prior to the date of such amendment or modification.   
  Section 15.2  Establishment of Separate Plan . If an Employer shall withdraw from this Plan under Section 11.2 (relating to
withdrawal from participation), the Investment Fiduciary shall determine the portion of the Trust Fund held by the Trustee which is applicable to the Participants of such Employer and direct the Trustee to segregate such portion in a separate trust.
  
         68   

Such separate trust shall thereafter be held and administered as a part of the separate plan of such Employer.      Section 15.3  Termination of the Plan by an Employer . The Company may at any time, by resolution adopted by its board of directors, terminate this Plan in its entirety. In addition, any Employer may
at any time terminate its participation in this Plan by resolution adopted by its board of directors to that effect. Contributions of an Employer to the Plan are conditioned on the receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of an initial favorable
determination letter that this Plan and the Trust Fund as adopted by the Company meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and if the Internal Revenue Service
shall refuse to issue such letter, any Employer may terminate its participation in this Plan and direct the Trustee to pay and deliver to that Employer the portion of the Trust Fund applicable to its contributions.   
  Section 15.4  Vesting and Distribution Upon Termination or Partial Termination . Upon termination or partial termination of the
Plan, the benefit as of the date of termination or partial termination, as the case may be, of all affected Participants shall be fully vested; provided, however, that full vesting shall be required with respect to a termination or partial
termination only to the extent the Plan is then funded.      Allocation and distribution of the terminated portion of the Trust
Fund shall thereafter be made in accordance with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and with any applicable approval of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the  PBGC ). If the Administrator is notified by PBGC that
PBGC is unable to determine that the Trust Fund is sufficient to discharge when due all obligations of the Plan with respect to benefits guaranteed by   
         69   

PBGC pursuant to section 4022 of ERISA, then the allocation and distribution of such portion of the Trust Fund shall be made only under the direction of PBGC or a United States district court
pursuant to section 4044 of ERISA.      In the event that, after the termination of the Plan, any assets remain after such
allocation, such assets shall be paid to the Company. The portion of the assets allocated to provide benefits to any person or group of persons may be applied for the benefit of such person or persons by the distribution of cash, continuance of the
Trust Fund, establishment of a new Trust Fund, purchase of annuities from an insurance company, or otherwise, as determined by the Investment Fiduciary in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the benefit of any Participant or former
Participant who is married and has satisfied the Vesting Requirement shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth in Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants) and,
if the surviving Spouse of a deceased Participant or deceased former Participant is entitled to receive a benefit pursuant to Section 7.2(b) (relating to manner of distribution with respect to married Participants) or Section 7.3 (relating
to pre-retirement death benefits), as the case may be, such benefit shall, unless such person shall elect otherwise, be paid in the form set forth therein.      Contributions of an Employer to the Plan are conditioned on the receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of an initial favorable determination letter that the Plan and Trust Fund as adopted by the
Company meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code and that the Trust Fund is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, and, in the event that the Internal Revenue Service shall refuse to issue such letter, the Company may terminate
the Plan and shall direct the Trustee to pay and deliver the Trust Fund to the Company.   
         70   

Section 15.5  Trust Fund to Be Applied Exclusively for Participants and Their
Beneficiaries . Subject only to the provisions of Section 4.2 (relating to limitation on contributions) and 15.4 (relating to vesting and distribution upon termination or partial termination), and any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary notwithstanding, it shall be impossible for any part of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to any purpose not for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their beneficiaries and the payment of expenses in accordance with
Section 13.1 (relating to expenses) either by operation or termination of the Plan, power of amendment or otherwise.   
         71

  SPECIAL RULES REGARDING COMPUTATION OF BENEFIT         

A.  
   Factors to Calculate Pension Paid Before Schedule A Normal Retirement Age      

1.  
     Pension Starting Date on or After Early Retirement Date and Prior to Schedule A Normal Retirement Age . The Pension attributable to the
     
         2   

Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant whose Termination of Employment occurs on or after his or her Early Retirement Date and whose Pension commences prior to his or her Schedule A Normal
Retirement Age shall be computed by multiplying such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor from Table B-1.          

2.  
   Pension Starting Date After Attainment of Age 60 but Prior to Early Retirement Date . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit of a Participant
whose Pension Starting Date occurs on or after such Participant s attainment of age 60 but prior to such Participant s attainment of his or her Early Retirement Date shall be such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit without any
actuarial reduction.         

3.  
   Pension Starting Date After Completion of Ten Years of Credited Service but Prior to Attainment of Age 60 . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen Benefit
of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs prior to such Participant s attainment of age 60 and prior to his or her attainment of his or her Early Retirement Date, but after the Participant has completed at least ten years of Credited
Service, shall be (a) if the Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs on or after his or her attainment of age 50, the amount determined by multiplying such Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit by the applicable factor in Table F
and (b) if the Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs prior to his or her attainment of age 50, the amount determined by actuarially reducing the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit using the factors in Table F to reduce the
Accrued Frozen Benefit from age 60 to age 50 and using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit to the Participant s Pension Starting Date.     

4.  
   Pension Starting Date Prior to Attainment of Age 60 and Prior to Completion of Ten Years of Credited Service . The Pension attributable to the Accrued Frozen
Benefit of a Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs prior to such Participant s attainment of age 60 and prior to such Participant s completion of ten years of Credited Service shall be computed by reducing the Participant s
Accrued Frozen Benefit by using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors to reduce the Accrued Frozen Benefit to the Pension Starting Date.         

B.  
   Distribution with Respect to Married Participants . Notwithstanding Section 7.2(b) of the Plan, if a Participant will receive his or her Accrued Benefit in
the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the payments attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be calculated and paid as follows:     

1.  
     Pension Starting Date After Attainment of Age 50 . Annuity payments will be made during the Participant s lifetime in an amount equal to the
annual Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single      
         3   

life annuity for the Participant s lifetime reduced by the product of (i) 50% of the annual amount of Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the
Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime multiplied by (ii) 40% of the applicable factor set forth in Table D.      
  Thereafter, if the Participant s Spouse shall survive the Participant, such Spouse shall receive during the remainder of the
Spouse s lifetime an annual amount, payable monthly, equal to 50% of the annual amount the Participant would have received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable as a single life annuity for the Participant s
lifetime.      If the Participant survives the Spouse, such Participant shall receive during the remainder of the
Participant s lifetime an annual amount payable monthly equal to the annual amount the Participant would have received if the Participant s Frozen Benefit were payable as a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime.

2.  
   Pension Starting Date Prior to Attainment of Age 50 . Annuity payments will be made during the Participant s lifetime in an amount equal to the annual
Accrued Frozen Benefit the Participant would have received if the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit were payable in the form of a single life annuity for the Participant s lifetime multiplied by (i) an applicable factor determined
by using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors.        Thereafter, if the Participant s Spouse shall survive the
Participant, such Spouse shall receive during the remainder of the Spouse s lifetime an annual amount, payable monthly, equal to 50% of the annuity payment prior to the Participant s death.   
  If the Participant survives the Spouse, the monthly annuity will continue to be paid without any further adjustments during the remainder
of the Participant s lifetime.       

C.  
     Post Retirement Adjustments . If a Participant s Pension Starting Date occurs on or after his or her 50   th    birthday and the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit is paid
in a form other than a lump sum distribution, the annual Accrued Frozen Benefit payable pursuant to this Schedule shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph C., be adjusted each October 1 for the twelve-month period then
beginning by adding a post-retirement cost of living adjustment computed by applying an adjustment percentage to the appropriate base specified in this paragraph C. A Participant whose Pension Starting Date occurs prior to his or her 50   th    birthday or who receives his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the
form of a lump sum distribution shall not be entitled to any post-retirement cost of living adjustment under this Schedule. In addition, the post-retirement cost of living adjustment shall apply only to the portion of a Participant s Accrued
Benefit that is attributable to his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit.      
         4   

1.  
  The adjustment percentage shall equal, for each October 1, the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the July immediately preceding such October 1
exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the July immediately preceding the twelve-month period beginning October 1 in which the Participant terminated employment or payment of a Pension commenced; provided, however, that:     
  (a) If, as of such October 1, there shall be no such excess, the adjustment percentage shall be deemed to be zero for the
twelve-month period beginning on such October 1.      (b) There shall be no negative adjustment percentage.   
  (c) The aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning October 1 shall never be lower than the aggregate
adjustment percentage for the preceding such period.      (d) If the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index computed for
the twelve-month period beginning on October 1 does not exceed the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period by at least three percentage points, the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month
period shall continue in effect during such twelve-month period beginning on October 1.      (e) The aggregate adjustment
percentage for any twelve-month period beginning on October 1 shall not be more than seven percentage points greater than that for the preceding twelve-month period. If the aggregate adjustment percentage for any twelve-month period beginning
on October 1 exceeds by more than seven percentage points the aggregate adjustment percentage for the preceding twelve-month period, the excess shall be carried over to succeeding twelve-month periods until such excess is reduced to zero.
     (f) The adjustment percentage for the twelve-month period beginning with the October 1 next following the date the
Participant s Pension Starting Date shall be the adjustment percentage determined in accordance with the preceding provisions of this paragraph C. multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of full calendar months
between such date and such October 1 and the denominator of which shall be twelve.       

2.  
    To determine the amount of the monthly cost of living adjustment, the adjustment percentage shall be applied to the first $500 per month of a
Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment of $500 or, if the monthly amount of such Accrued Frozen Benefit is less than $500 per month, subject to a maximum monthly adjustment equal to the monthly Accrued
Frozen Benefit payment. To      
         5   

determine the amount of the adjustment made in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or surviving Spouse annuity payable pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Plan to the surviving
Spouse of a deceased Participant, a family pension payable pursuant to Section 4.B. of this Schedule to a surviving Dependent Minor Child or Children of a deceased Participant or a surviving dependent s pension payable pursuant to
Section 4.C. of this Schedule to a surviving Dependent Disabled Child or Children of a deceased Participant, the adjustment percentage shall be applied to the first $250 per month of such annuity or pension, subject to a maximum monthly
adjustment of $175 ($250 in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity) or, if the monthly amount of such annuity or pension is less than $175 ($250 in the case of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity), subject to a maximum monthly
adjustment equal to the monthly Accrued Frozen Benefit payment.          

D.  
   Lump Sum Value . If a Participant elects to receive his or her Accrued Frozen Benefit in the form of a lump sum distribution as described in Option 2 of
Section 7.2(c) of the Plan, the amount of the lump sum attributable to the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit shall be the greater of:         

1.  
  the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the Participant s Accrued Frozen Benefit determined using the Schedule A Actuarial Factors, and

amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans plus all LC Exposure does not exceed the aggregate Maximum Amount then in effect.   
  Section 2.02  Letters of Credit       (a)  General . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may request the Bank, and the Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for the account of the
Company, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. The Bank shall have no obligation to issue, and Company shall not request the issuance of, any Letter of Credit at any time if after giving effect to such issuance, the sum
of the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder and the LC Exposure would exceed the Maximum Amount. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of
any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Company to, or entered into by the Company with, the Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.   
  (b)  Request for Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions and Notices . To request the issuance of a Letter of
Credit or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit, the Company shall deliver, by hand or telecopier (or transmit by electronic communication), an LC Request to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Bank,
(i) in the case of an amendment, renewal or extension, (A) not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the same Business Day of the requested date of amendment, renewal or extension, or (B) on the Business Day immediately preceding
the requested date of amendment, renewal or extension (if such LC Request is delivered later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time)) and (ii) in the case of an issuance, (A) not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the second Business Day
preceding the requested date of issuance and (B) on the third Business Day immediately preceding the requested date of issuance (if such LC Request is delivered later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time)).   
  A request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Bank:   
  (i) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day);   
  (ii) the amount thereof;      (iii) the expiry date thereof (which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.02(c));      (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof;      (v) the
documents to be presented by such beneficiary in connection with any drawing thereunder;      (vi) the full text of
any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in connection with any drawing thereunder; and      (vii) such
other matters as the Bank may reasonably require.   
         - 12 -

A request for an amendment, renewal or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit shall specify in form
and detail satisfactory to the Bank:      (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended;   
  (ii) the proposed date of amendment, renewal or extension thereof (which shall be a Business Day);   
  (iii) the nature of the proposed amendment, renewal or extension; and   
  (iv) such other matters as the Bank may reasonably require.      A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and, upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant
that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the Credit Exposure (assuming, for purposes of such determination, that each Letter of Credit then in effect (after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension) will remain outstanding until its stated expiration date) shall not exceed the Maximum Amount and (ii) the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.03 in respect of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
shall have been satisfied or waived by the Bank. Unless the Bank shall agree otherwise, no Letter of Credit shall be in an initial amount less than $1,000,000, or shall be denominated in a currency other than Dollars.   
  (c)  Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
that is 364 days after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof (including any automatic or  evergreen  renewal), 364 days after such renewal or extension and, in either case,
if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately succeeding Business Day) and (ii) the Final Stated Maturity Date;  provided ,  however , that no Letter of Credit may be issued unless at the time of such issuance there is Unused
Maximum Amount with a Stated Maturity Date which extends at least 30 days beyond the expiration date of such Letter of Credit.   
  Section 2.03.  Changes in the Maximum Amount . (a) The Company may, at any time during the period from the Closing Date to
the earlier to occur of (i) date of termination of the Commitment in whole, by notice to the Administrative Agent (for the account of the Bank) or (ii) June 15, 2011, request that the Maximum Amount be increased by an amount of
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof (each a   Maximum Amount Increase  ) to be effective as of a date prior to the Final Stated Maturity Date as specified in the related notice to the Bank;
 provided ,  however , that (A) in no event shall the Maximum Amount at any time exceed $500,000,000, (B) on the applicable Increase Date, the applicable conditions set forth in subsection (b) below shall be satisfied and
(C) on the first Increase Date the Maximum Amount Increase shall be an amount not less than $50,000,000.      (b) If the Bank
is willing to agree to such requested Maximum Amount Increase, in its sole discretion after giving due consideration in good faith after receipt of such request, it shall give notice (which notice may be given via telephone or in writing) to the
Company that it is willing to increase the Maximum Amount, the amount by which it is willing to increase the Maximum Amount and any proposed change to Ongoing Facility Fee that will be required by the Bank in connection with such Maximum Amount
Increase (collectively, the   Proposed Terms  ), provided that the Company shall have the right to cancel its request at any time prior to its acceptance (which acceptance may be given via telephone or in writing) of the Proposed
Terms. The failure of the Bank to respond to a request for a Maximum Amount Increase shall constitute a refusal by the Bank to accept such requested Maximum Amount Increase. The parties hereto agree that the   Ongoing Facility Fee  
shall be set based upon the calculation of the Credit Default Swap rate determined based upon the period of time remaining until the Stated Maturity Date   
         - 13 -

specified with respect to such Maximum Amount on Annex A on the calculation date plus the Applicable Spread. If the Maximum Amount falls within separate categories based upon the Applicable
Spread, the Bank shall calculate the Ongoing Facility Fee by blending the rate based upon the proportion of such letter of credit falling in the different categories. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth below, each Maximum
Amount Increase and any related change to the Ongoing Facility Fee shall be effective upon the Company s acceptance (which acceptance may be given via telephone or in writing) of the Proposed Terms (the date of any such acceptance being the
  Increase Date  ) and shall be evidenced by an amendment to this Agreement, substantially in the form of Annex A hereto, signed by the Company and the Bank, which the Company authorizes the Administrative Agent to attach to this
Agreement. Each Maximum Amount Increase shall be subject to the conditions precedent that, on the applicable Increase Date, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) all representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01 (other than subsection (e) and the first sentence of subsection (f) thereof) shall be true and correct in all material respects. The acceptance by the Company of any Proposed Terms
shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that, on the applicable Increase Date, the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence have been satisfied.   
  (c) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth below, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time
to time upon at least three Business Days  written notice to the Administrative Agent (for the account of the Bank), specifying the proposed amount and effective date of such reduction (any such date being a   Decrease Date  ),
to reduce all or any part of the Bank s unused Commitment;  provided ,  however , that (i) the Company shall not be able to reduce that portion of the Bank s Commitment for which a Letter of Credit has been issued and is
outstanding or any Loan is outstanding, and (ii) each such reduction shall be in the amount of $50,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any such reduction of the Commitment shall automatically reduce the Maximum Amount
by the amount of the Commitment so reduced. Any such notice of reduction, when delivered to the Administrative Agent, shall be irrevocable. Any reduction of the Commitment under this subsection (c) shall be subject to the condition that on the
applicable Decrease Date, all representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.01(k) shall be true and correct in all material respects. Any request by the Company for a reduction in the Commitment shall be deemed to
constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that, on the applicable Decrease Date, the condition set forth in the preceding sentence has been satisfied. Upon any reduction of the Maximum Amount, the Agent shall, as of the Reduction Date,
recalculate the Ongoing Facility Fee such that the Applicable Spread is consistent with the Maximum Amount in effect on such date.      (d) In the event that the Commitment is reduced, or if any Maximum Amount Increase does not become effective because the conditions precedent to such event were not satisfied on the applicable Increase
Date after acceptance by the Company of the relevant Proposed Terms, the Bank may enter into transactions in order to unwind credit derivatives transactions that the Bank or its Affiliates may have entered into in order to mitigate credit risk of
the Letters of Credit or, in the case of any reduction in the Commitment, in order to unwind such transactions (the   Unwind Transactions  ). The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (for the account of the Bank), within
three Business Days after submission by the Bank of a reasonably detailed statement, together with any supporting detail reasonably requested by the Company, all actual costs and losses incurred by or on behalf of the Bank in connection with any
Unwind Transactions (the   Unwind Costs  ) as determined by the Bank in a commercially reasonable manner, and in any case in a manner consistent with prevailing market practice and investment banking conventions at the time of such
reduction in the Maximum Amount, taking into account such factors as the Bank reasonably deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the size of the reduction and the prevailing debt market conditions, prevailing credit default swap market
conditions, overall market liquidity and the credit quality of the Company at the time of the applicable reduction in the Commitment. The Bank agrees to conduct all Unwind Transactions in   
         - 14 -

a commercially reasonable manner and to provide the Company with documentary evidence of any Unwind Costs promptly upon request by the Company.   
  (e) In the event that the Commitment is reduced solely at the option of the Company pursuant to Section 2.03(c), then the Company
shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent (for the account of the Bank), within three Business Days after such reduction a Make Whole Premium times the amount of such reduction divided by 4 (the   Make Whole Quarterly Amount  ),
present valued as if the Make Whole Quarterly Amount was paid quarterly on the first day of each January, April, July and October until the Final Stated Maturity Date,  provided  that the payments attributable to the final 4 quarters of this
facility will not be present valued. The Make Whole Quarterly Amounts will be present valued at the interpolated US Treasury yield between the nearest two US Treasury benchmark securities (determined on the date of written notice of such reduction)
(the   Termination Fee  ). At any time when a Termination Fee is due and payable to the Bank hereunder, and the Bank has received any payments representing gains (the   Unwind Gains  ) in connection with the associated
Unwind Transactions, the Bank agrees to rebate to the Company 50% of the amount of such Unwind Gains up to the amount of the Termination Fee.      (f) If the Company notifies the Bank at any time or from time to time that it has concluded, in its reasonable determination, that one or more intended beneficiaries are unwilling to accept Letters of
Credit issued by the Bank or cash equivalents or other liquid financial assets to be provided by the Bank (it being understood that the provision of such cash equivalents or other liquid financial assets will be subject to mutually satisfactory
additional definitive documentation between the Company and the Bank) as a result of a reduction by one or more rating agencies of the Bank s debt ratings or financial strength ratings or the occurrence of a similar event relating to the
Bank s creditworthiness as a collateral substitute provider and the Company cannot, after using reasonable efforts for a period of five (5) Business Days, alter its collateral requirements with such intended beneficiaries to enable the
Bank to deliver Letters of Credit (or cash equivalents or other liquid financial assets) to those intended beneficiaries requiring collateral from the Company who are otherwise willing to accept Letters of Credit (or cash equivalents or other liquid
financial assets); provided that such reasonable efforts shall in no event require any payment to an intended beneficiary by the Company, then the Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the option to reduce the Maximum Amount to an amount not
less than the amount of the LC Exposure at such time and shall not be obligated to pay the Termination Fee.      (g) The Company
may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the first Increase Date by giving the Bank one Business Day s prior notice of such termination and shall not be obligated to pay the Termination Fee or Unwind Costs.   
  Section 2.04.  Reimbursement and Indemnity . (a) If the Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of
Credit, the Company shall reimburse to the Bank the amount of such LC Disbursement on the Business Day following the date of such LC Disbursement, subject to Section 2.04(b).   
  (b) Unless the Company shall reimburse any LC Disbursement in full on the date on which such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid
principal amount of such LC Disbursement shall convert automatically into an LC Loan and shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Company repays such LC Loan in
full, in accordance with Section 2.01;  provided ,  however , that any LC Loan shall initially be a Base Rate Loan, and, immediately after the making of such Loan, shall be subject to conversion pursuant to Section 2.01(c).
  
         - 15 -

(c) The reimbursement obligation of the Company shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this
Agreement, or any term or provision therein; (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit being proved to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
in any respect; (iii) payment by the Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that fails to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.04, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Company hereunder; (v) the fact that a
Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (vi) any material adverse change in the business, property, results of operations, prospects or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company. None of the Bank or any of its Affiliates shall
have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any
error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Bank;  provided , however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of
any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the Bank s failure to
exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the
part of the Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination;  provided ,  however , that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Bank
from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential, special or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by Requirements of Law) suffered by the
Company that are caused by the Bank s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under the applicable Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Bank may, in its sole discretion,
either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in
strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.      (d) The Company agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless the
Bank and its correspondents from and against all claims, actions, suits and other proceedings, and all actual loss, damages and reasonable and documented out of pocket costs (including fees and expenses of counsel) which the Bank or any of its
correspondents may suffer or incur by reason of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, the use of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof, or any act or omission in respect of any Letter of Credit;  provided ,  however , that the
Company shall not be required to indemnify the Bank or its Affiliates for any claim, damage, loss, liability, cost or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (A) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Bank in
determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (B) the Bank s failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.      (e) The Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if:   
         - 16 -

(i) the Interest Coverage Ratio as of the last day of the immediately
preceding fiscal quarter was less than 3.00 to 1.0; or      (ii) there has been an announcement by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc (  ISDA  ) that the relevant Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (or its successor) has determined that a Credit Event (defined as a  Failure to Pay  with respect
to an Obligation of the Company described by the  Borrowed Money   Obligation Category , as those terms are defined in the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions or a  Bankruptcy   Credit Event  as those
terms are defined in the ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions) has occurred with respect to the Company (unless and until the ISDA Credit Determination Committee rescinds such determination, an   ISDA Credit Event  ). For purposes
hereof,   ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions   means the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, as supplemented by the 2009 ISDA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees and Auction Settlement Supplement to the 2003 ISDA
Credit Derivatives Definitions, in each case, as published by ISDA; or     (iii) any order, judgment or decree of
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to the Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Bank with respect
to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was
not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Bank in good faith deems material to it; or      (iv) the issuance
of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more written policies of the Bank related generally to the Bank s letters of credit practices and procedures.      The Bank shall be under no obligation to amend or extend any Letter of Credit if (A) the Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.   
  Section 2.05.  Fees, Costs and Expenses . The Company agrees to pay to the Bank the following fees:   
  (a) The Company agrees to pay the Bank on the first day of each January, April, July and October of each year, quarterly in arrears, the
Ongoing Facility Fee of the Maximum Amount.      (b) The Company agrees to pay to the Bank its customary administrative charges
disclosed in writing to the Company for the issuance, amendment, honoring or maintenance of letters of credit and to reimburse the Bank for all reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses incurred by it or any of its correspondents in
connection with issuing or amending the Letter of Credit; including without limitation:       

(i)  
  a fee of $200.00 for each drawing under the Letter of Credit. The drawing fee for each drawing shall be payable together with the reimbursement for such drawing;

(ii)  
  a fee of $1,000.00 for each transfer of the Letter of Credit, payable upon such transfer; and     
         - 17 -

(iii)  
  a fee of $500.00 for each amendment of the Letter of Credit, payable on the date of such amendment.     
  (c) If for any reason, including without limitation due to demand or due to acceleration following the occurrence of an Event of Default,
the principal of any Revolving Loan, or any portion thereof, is paid prior to the scheduled maturity date therefor, or if any Revolving Loan is not borrowed after notice thereof shall have been received by the Bank, the Company will reimburse the
Bank, on demand, for any resulting actual loss (excluding any loss of anticipated profit) or reasonable and documented out of pocket expense incurred by the Bank, including without limitation any actual loss or reasonable and documented out of
pocket expense incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties.      (d) The fees shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days to elapse, including the first day but excluding the last day. If on the effectiveness of any Increase Date the Ongoing Facility Fee differs from the Ongoing
Facility Fee previously in effect, the Ongoing Facility Fee after the Increase Date shall be calculated as provided in Annex A hereto. Overdue payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable hereunder shall bear interest, payable on
demand, at a rate for each day equal to the Funded Rate for such day plus two percent (2%).      Section 2.06.  Increased
Costs; Reduced Return . (a) If after the date hereof the adoption of any law, rule, or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by the Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency (i) subjects the Bank to
any charge with respect to the Commitment or any Letter of Credit or changes the basis of taxation of payments to the Bank hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of the Bank) or (ii) imposes, modifies or
makes applicable any reserve, special deposit, deposit insurance assessment or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by the Bank, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Bank of issuing or maintaining the
Commitment or any Letter of Credit or to reduce any amount received or receivable by the Bank hereunder, then upon demand by the Bank, the Company shall pay to the Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such increased
cost or reduction;  provided ,  however , that the Bank shall not be entitled to demand such compensation more than 180 days following the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made with respect to a Loan or
more than 180 days following the expiration or termination (by a drawing or otherwise) of a Letter of Credit in respect of which such demand is made;  provided ,  further , that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of the
Bank to demand or receive such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the retroactive application of any law, regulation, guideline or request described in clause (i) or (ii) above if such demand is made within 180
days after the implementation of such retroactive law, interpretation, guideline or request.      (b) If the adoption after the
date hereof of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or other agency, has or would have the effect
of reducing the rate of return on the Bank s capital as a consequence of its obligations under any Letter of Credit to a level below that which the Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance by an amount deemed by the
Bank to be material, the Company shall pay to the Bank, on demand, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such   
         - 18 -

reduction;  provided ,  however , that the Bank shall not be entitled to demand such compensation more than one year following the payment to or for the account of Bank of all other
amounts payable hereunder by the Company and the termination of the Commitment;  provided ,  further , that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of the Bank to demand or receive such compensation to the extent that such
compensation relates to the retroactive application of any applicable law, rule or regulation described above if such demand is made within one year after the implementation of such retroactive law, interpretation, guideline or request.   
  (c) A certificate of the Bank as to the additional amount or amounts payable to it under this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.      (d) Bank shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such compensation that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of Bank, be
otherwise disadvantageous to Bank.      Section 2.07.  Payments and Computations . (a) The Company shall make or
cause to be made each payment hereunder in lawful money of the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Bank at UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Stamford CT, ABA: 026 007
993, Acct Name: BPS Loan Finance Account, Acct # WA-894001-001, Ref.:Exelon, or at such other address as the Administrative Agent may designate from time to time pursuant to a written notice delivered to the Company.   
  (b) Any payments of fees, commission or other amount not paid when due hereunder shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day
until payment in full at a rate per annum equal to the sum the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus two percent (2%). All computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, interest shall in no event accrue hereunder at a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.   
  (c) All payments under this Agreement by the Company will be payable to the Bank free and clear of any and all present and future United
States Federal, state and local taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, withholdings, fees, liabilities and similar charges other than those imposed on the overall net income of the Bank or Bank s failure to satisfy the applicable
requirements as set forth in any statute enacted (or regulation or administrative guidance promulgated thereunder) after the date hereof that is based on, or similar to, Subtitle A - Foreign Account Tax Compliance of H.R. 2847, as passed by the
United States House of Representatives on March 4, 2010 (  Taxes  ). If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amount payable under this Agreement, then the amount payable under this Agreement will be
increased to the amount which, after deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld or deducted therefrom, will yield to the Bank the amount stated to be payable under this Agreement, and the Company will promptly provide
to the Bank tax receipts evidencing the payment of such Taxes. If any of the Taxes specified in this subsection (c) are paid by the Bank, the Company will, upon demand of the Bank, reimburse the Bank for such payments, together with any
interest and penalties which may be imposed by the governmental agency or taxing authority. If any Taxes for which the Bank has received payment from the Company hereunder shall be finally determined to have been incorrectly or illegally asserted
and are refunded to the Bank, the Bank shall promptly forward to the Company any such refunded amount.      (d) If the Bank is
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (a   Non-U.S. Payee  ) it shall deliver to the   
         - 19 -

Company two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or applicable successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Payee claiming
complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, United States Federal withholding tax on payments by the Company under this Agreement. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Payee on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or,
in the case of a Bank that becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance (a   Transferee  ), on or prior to the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance) and on or before the date, if any, such
Non-U.S. Payee changes its Applicable Lending Office by designating a different lending office (a   New Lending Office  ). In addition, each Non-U.S. Payee shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any
form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Payee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.07(d), a Non-U.S. Payee shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.07(d) that such Non-U.S. Payee is not
legally able to deliver.      (e) The Company shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Payee, or to pay any additional
amounts to any Non-U.S. Payee, in respect of United States Federal, state or local withholding tax pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States
Federal, state or local withholding tax existed on the date such Non-U.S. Payee became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee, on the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which such Transferee acquired the
rights and obligations of the Bank hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Non-U.S. Payee designated such New Lending Office with respect to an Extension of Credit;  provided ,  however , that this
clause (i) shall not apply to any person that becomes an assignee of the Bank or New Lending Office that becomes a New Lending Office as a result of an assignment or designation made at the request of the Company; and  provided ,
 further ,  however , that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent the indemnity payment or additional amounts the Bank, the Administrative Agent or the Bank through a New Lending Office would be entitled to receive (without
regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional amounts that the person making the assignment or transfer to th Bank, the Administrative Agent or such Bank making the designation of such New Lending Office would have
been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, transfer or designation or (ii) the obligation to pay such additional amounts or such indemnity payments would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S. Payee to comply with
the provisions of subsection (d) above or (f) below.      (f) If the Bank claims any payment or additional amounts

     (ii) if the Executive first acquired knowledge of such act or omission more than 90 days before the Executive

provided up to 12 months after the Termination Date. No cash shall be paid in lieu of such fees and costs.      (g)
 Termination during the Post-Change Period or Post-Significant Acquisition Period: Indemnification . The Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law as the same now
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification than was permitted prior to such amendment) and the Company s by-laws as
such exist on the Applicable Trigger Date if the Executive was, is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any pending, completed or threatened action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing
or any other proceeding brought by a third party (and not by or on behalf of the Company or its shareholders) whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or
was, or had agreed to become, a director, officer, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or any other entity which the Executive is or was serving at the request of the Company (  Proceeding  ), against all expenses (including
all reasonable attorneys  fees) and all claims, damages, liabilities and losses incurred or suffered by the Executive or to which the Executive may become subject for any reason; provided, that the Company shall not be required to indemnify the
Executive in connection with any proceeding initiated by the Executive, including a counterclaim or cross claim, unless such proceeding was authorized by the Company and Executive fully cooperates in the investigation and defense of such Proceeding.
A Proceeding shall not include any proceeding to the extent it concerns or relates to a matter described in Section 6.1(a) (concerning reimbursement of certain costs and expenses). Upon receipt from Executive of (i) a written request for
an advancement of expenses, which Executive reasonably believes will be subject to indemnification hereunder and (ii) a written undertaking by Executive to repay any such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that Executive is not
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, advance such expenses to Executive or pay such expenses for Executive, all in advance of the final disposition of any such
matter.      (h)  Termination during the Post-Change Period or Post-Significant Acquisition Period:
Directors  and Officers  Liability Insurance . For a period of six years after the Termination Date (or for any known longer applicable statute of limitations period), the Company shall provide Executive with coverage under a
directors  and officers  liability insurance policy in an amount no less than, and on terms no less favorable than, those provided to senior executive officers and directors of the Company on the Applicable Trigger Date.   
         23   

4.2  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period . If, during an Imminent
Control Change Period, Executive has a Termination of Employment that would entitle Executive to benefits under Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan or its successor, then the Company shall, prior to the
occurrence of a Change Date, provide Executive any benefits to which Executive may be entitled under Section 4 (i.e., non-change in control) of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan or its successor. If, during an Imminent
Control Change Period, the Employer terminates Executive s employment other than for Disability and other than for Cause, or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason then subject to the preceding sentence, unless such Termination of
Employment occurred during the Post-Significant Acquisition Period, the Company s sole obligations to Executive under Articles II and IV shall be as set forth in this Section 4.2. The Company s obligations to Executive under this
Section 4.2 shall be reduced by any amounts or benefits paid or provided pursuant to the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan (whether under Section 4 thereof or any other provision) or any successor thereto. If
Executive s Termination of Employment occurred during any portion of an Imminent Control Change Period that is also a Post-Significant Acquisition Period, the Company s obligations to Executive, if any, shall be determined under
Section 4.1.      (a)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Cash Severance Payments . If
the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Executive the amounts described in Section 4.1(a)(i) through (vi). Such amounts shall be paid to Executive as described in
Section 4.4, provided that amounts that would have been paid prior to the Change Date shall be paid in a lump sum (without interest) within 30 business days after the Change Date.   
  (b)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Vested Stock Options . Executive s Stock Options, to
the extent vested on the Termination Date,      (i) will not expire (unless such Stock Options would have expired
had Executive remained an employee of the Company) during the Imminent Control Change Period; and      (ii) will
continue to be exercisable after the Termination Date to the extent provided in the applicable grant agreement or Plan, and thereafter, such Stock Options shall not be exercisable during the Imminent Control Change Period.   
  If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date, then Executive s Stock Options, to the extent vested on the
Termination Date, may be exercised, in whole or in part, during the 30-day period following the lapse of the Imminent Control Change Period, or, if longer, the period during which Executive s vested Stock Options could otherwise be exercised
under the terms of the applicable grant agreement or Plan (but in no case shall any Stock Options remain exercisable after the date on which such Stock Options would have expired if Executive had remained an employee of the Company).   
  If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then effective upon the Change Date, Executive s Stock Options, to
the extent vested on the Termination   
         24   

Date, may be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until (1) the option expiration date for such Stock Options granted prior to January 1, 2002 or (2) the
earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Change Date or the option expiration date for such Stock Options granted on or after January 1, 2002; provided that this Section shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in
connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.      (c)  Termination During an
Imminent Control Change Period: Unvested Stock Options . Executive s Stock Options that are not vested on the Termination Date      (i) will not expire (unless such Stock Options would have expired had Executive remained an employee of the Company) during the Imminent Control Change Period; and   
  (ii) will not continue to vest and will not be exercisable during the Imminent Control Change Period after the expiration
of the period for post-termination exercise under the terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreement.      If the Imminent Control
Change lapses without a Change Date, such unvested Stock Options will thereupon expire.      If the Imminent Control Change
culminates in a Change Date, then immediately prior to the Change Date, such unvested Stock Options shall become fully vested, and may thereupon be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until (1) the option expiration date
for such Stock Options granted prior to January 1, 2002 or (2) the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the Change Date, or the option expiration date for such Stock Options granted on or after January 1, 2002; provided that this
Section shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection with a corporate transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.      (d)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Performance Shares . Executive s Performance Shares granted under the Exelon Performance Share Program under the LTIP will not be
forfeited during the Imminent Control Change Period, and will not continue to vest during the Imminent Control Change Period. If the Imminent Control Change lapses without a Change Date, such Performance Shares shall be governed according to the
terms of Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan. If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date:      (1) All Performance Shares granted to the Executive under the Exelon Performance Share Program under the LTIP, which, as of the Termination Date, have been earned by and awarded to the Executive, shall
become fully vested at the actual earned level on the Change Date, and      (2) All of the Performance Shares
granted to the Executive under the Exelon Performance Share Program under the LTIP which, as of the Termination Date, have  not  been earned by and awarded to the   
         25   

Executive shall become fully vested on the Change Date at the LTIP Target Level.      (e)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Restricted Stock . Executive s unvested Restricted Stock will:   
  (i) not be forfeited during the Imminent Control Change Period; and   
  (ii) not continue to vest during the Imminent Control Change Period.   
  If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date, such unvested Restricted Stock shall thereupon be forfeited.
     If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then immediately prior to the Change Date, Executive s
Restricted Stock shall (except as specifically provided to the contrary in the award) become fully vested.      (f)
 Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Continuation of Welfare Benefits . The Company shall continue to provide to Executive and Executive s family welfare benefits (other than any severance pay that may be considered a
welfare benefit) during the Imminent Change Period which are at least as favorable as welfare benefits under the most favorable Welfare Plans of the Company applicable with respect to peer executives who are actively employed after the Termination
Date and their families; subject to the following:      (i) In determining benefits applicable under such Welfare
Plans, the Executive s annual compensation attributable to base salary and incentives for any plan year or calendar year, as applicable, shall be deemed to be not less than the Executive s Base Salary and Annual Incentive;   
  (ii) The cost of such welfare benefits to Executive and family under this Section 4.2(f) shall not exceed the cost of
such benefits to peer executives who are actively employed after the Termination Date.      (iii) Executive s
rights under this Section 4.2(f) shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any post-termination continuation coverage or conversion rights the Executive may have pursuant to applicable law, including, without limitation, continuation coverage
required by Section 4980B of the Code.      If the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date, welfare
benefit plan coverage under this Section 4.2(f) shall thereupon cease, subject to Executive s rights, if any, to continued coverage under a Welfare Plan, Section 4 of the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan, or
applicable law. If the Imminent Control Change Period culminates in a Change Date, then for the remainder of the Severance Period (and continuing through such later date as any Welfare Plan may specify), the Company shall continue to provide
Executive and Executive s family welfare benefits as described in, and subject to the limitations of Section 4.1(e).   
         26   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive obtains a specific type of coverage under
welfare plan(s) sponsored by another employer of Executive (e.g. medical, prescription, vision, dental, disability, individual life insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits, but excluding for the purposes of this sentence retiree benefits
if Executive is so eligible), then the Company shall not be obligated to provide such any specific type of coverage. The Executive shall immediately notify the Company of any such coverage.   
  (g)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Outplacement . To the extent actually incurred by
Executive, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid on behalf of Executive, as incurred, all reasonable fees and costs charged by a nationally recognized outplacement firm selected by the Executive for outplacement services provided up to 12 months
after the Termination Date. No cash shall be paid in lieu of such fees and costs.      (h)  Termination During an
Imminent Control Change Period: Indemnification . The Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the same extent as provided in Section 4.1(g), but only during the Imminent Control Change Period (or greater period
provided under the Company s by-laws) if the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date.   
  (i)  Termination During an Imminent Control Change Period: Directors  and Officers  Liability Insurance .
The Company shall provide the same level of directors  and officers  liability insurance for Executive as provided in Section 4.1(h), but only during the Imminent Control Change Period (or greater period provided under the
Company s by-laws) if the Imminent Control Change Period lapses without a Change Date.      4.3  Termination During a
Post-Disaggregation Period . If, during a Post-Disaggregation Period the Disaggregated Entity terminates Executive s employment other than for Cause or Disability, or if Executive terminates employment for Good Reason, the Company s
sole obligations to Executive under Articles II and IV shall be as set forth in this Section 4.3, subject to Section 3.3(c), but only to the extent not provided by the Disaggregated Entity.   
  (a)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period: Cash Severance Payments . The Company shall pay Executive the
amounts described in Section 4.1(a), as provided in Section 4.4.      (b)  Termination During a
Post-Disaggregation Period: Stock Options . All of Executive s Stock Options granted prior to the Disaggregation that have not expired, whether or not converted to options or stock of the Disaggregated Entity or Merger Survivor, shall be
fully vested, and may be exercised in whole or in part by the Executive at any time until (1) the remaining option expiration date for such Stock Options granted prior to January 1, 2002 and (2) the earlier of the fifth anniversary of
the Termination Date or the option expiration date for such Stock Options granted on or after January 1, 2002; provided that this Section shall not limit the right of the Company to cancel the Stock Options in connection with a corporate
transaction pursuant to the terms of the LTIP.   
         27   

(c)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period: Performance
Shares . Executive s Performance Shares granted prior to the Disaggregation, whether or not earned by and awarded to the Executive as of the Disaggregation, and whether or not converted to performance shares of the Disaggregated Entity or
the Merger Survivor, shall become fully vested (at the earned level for Performance Shares earned and awarded, and at the target level for any converted performance shares not yet earned and awarded) on the Termination Date.   
  (d)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period: Restricted Stock . Executive s unvested Restricted Stock,
whether or not converted to restricted stock of the Disaggregated Entity or Merger Survivor, shall become fully vested on the Termination Date.      (e)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period: Continuation of Welfare Benefits . Until the end of the Severance Period, the Company shall continue to provide to Executive and Executive s
family welfare benefits with the same rights in relation to continuation coverage, status in relation to other employer benefits, scope and cost as described in Section 4.1(e); provided that, to the extent Executive is eligible for
post-termination continuation coverage under the plans of the Disaggregated Entity, whether pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or otherwise, the continued coverage required hereunder shall be provided under the plans of the Disaggregated
Entity (and the Company shall reimburse the cost to Executive of such coverage).      (f)  Termination During a
Post-Disaggregation Period: Outplacement . To the extent actually incurred by Executive, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid on behalf of Executive, as incurred, all reasonable fees and costs charged by a nationally recognized outplacement

  (g)  Termination During a Post-Disaggregation Period: Indemnification . The Executive shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company to the same extent as provided in Section 4.1(g).      (h)  Termination During a

     4.4  Timing of Severance Payments . Unless otherwise specified herein, the amounts described in Section 4.1(a)(i)
shall be paid within 30 business days of the Termination Date, and such amounts shall be considered  short-term deferrals  with the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. The amounts described in Sections 4.1(a)(ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Incentive Plan, deferred compensation plan or SERP and, if applicable, Executive s distribution election thereunder as of the Termination Date (or, if no affirmative
election is in effect as of such date, the default election as of such date). The severance payments described in Section 4.1(a)(vi) shall be paid as follows:   
         28   

(a) Beginning no later than forty five days after the
Termination Date, the Company shall make periodic payments to the Executive according to the Company s normal payroll practices at a monthly rate equal to
   1   /  12   of the sum of (i) the Executive s
Base Salary in effect as of the Termination Date plus (ii) the Severance Incentive; and       (b) Within
30 business days of the second anniversary of the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a cash lump sum equal to the difference between the total Severance Payment less the total amount paid pursuant to normal payroll practices under
Section 4.4(a);      provided that in the event the Company determines that Executive is a  specified employee,  within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code, and that certain of the payments made to Executive under Section 4.1(a)(vi) constitute the payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, then any of such payments that
pursuant to this Section 4.4 would be paid prior to the six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date shall, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, be delayed and be paid to Executive on the six-month anniversary
of Executive s Termination Date. The Stock Options, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock awards shall be paid in accordance with the LTIP and the applicable award agreements; provided that, in the event the Company determines that Executive
is a  specified employee,  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and that an award constitutes the payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, then any payment of such award pursuant to
this Section 4.4 that would be paid prior to the six-month anniversary of Executive s Termination Date shall, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, be delayed and paid to Executive on the six-month anniversary of
Executive s Termination Date. The in-kind benefits and reimbursements provided under each of Sections 4.1(e), 4.1(g), 4.2(f), 4.2(h), 4.3(e) and 4.4(g) during any calendar year shall not affect the benefits or reimbursements to be provided
under such section in any subsequent calendar year. The right to such benefits and reimbursements shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.      4.5  Waiver and Release . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Executive s right to the benefits provided under Article IV or Article V hereof shall be contingent upon
(i) Executive having executed and delivered to the Company a waiver and general release provided by the Company (the  Waiver and Release ) not later than the date set forth in the release (but in no event more than 45 days after the
Termination Date) (the  Consideration Period ), (ii) Executive not revoking such release in accordance with the terms of the release and (ii) Executive not violating any of Executive s on-going obligations under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Company has the discretion to pay such benefits prior to receipt of the Waiver and Release and/or the expiration of the revocation period; provided further that if Executive does not execute and deliver a
release to the Company prior to the expiration of the Consideration Period or if the Executive revokes the release in accordance with its terms, Executive shall pay to the Company within 10 days following the expiration of the Consideration Period
or the date such release was revoked, a lump sum payment of all payments received by Executive to date hereunder.      4.6
 Breach of Covenants . If a court determines that Executive has breached any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidential information or intellectual property covenant entered into between Executive and Company, the Company shall not be
obligated to pay or provide any   
         29   

severance or benefits under Articles IV or V, all unexercised Stock Options shall terminate as of the date of the breach, and all Restricted Stock shall be forfeited as of the date of the breach.
     4.7  Termination by the Company for Cause . If the Company (or Affiliate or, if applicable, the Disaggregated Entity)
terminates Executive s employment for Cause during the Post-Change Period, the Imminent Control Change Period, the Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or the Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under
Articles II, IV, and V shall be to pay Executive, pursuant to the Company s then-effective Plans, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations determined as of the Termination Date. The remaining applicable provisions of this
Agreement (including the restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.      4.8  Termination by Executive
Other Than for Good Reason . If Executive elects to retire or otherwise terminate employment during the Post-Change Period, the Imminent Control Change Period, the Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or the Post-Disaggregation Period, other than
for Good Reason, Disability or death, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under Articles II, IV, and V shall be to pay Executive, pursuant to the Company s then-effective Plans, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued
Obligations determined as of the Termination Date. The remaining provisions of this Agreement (including the restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.      4.9  Termination by the Company for Disability . If the Company (or Disaggregated Entity, if applicable) terminates Executive s employment by reason of Executive s Disability during a
Post-Change Period, Imminent Control Change Period that culminates in a Change Date, Post-Significant Acquisition Period or Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s sole obligation to Executive under Articles II, IV, and V shall be as follows,
and such obligations shall be reduced by amounts paid or provided by the Disaggregated Entity:      (a) to pay
Executive, a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of amounts specified in Section 4.1(a)(i) and (ii) determined as of the Termination Date,      (b) to pay Executive the amounts described in Section 4.1(a)(iii) in accordance with the applicable deferred compensation plan and Executive s distribution election thereunder as of the
Termination Date (or, if no affirmative election is in effect as of such date, the default election as of such date) and      (c) to provide Executive disability and other benefits after the Termination Date that are not less than the most favorable of such benefits then available under Plans of the Company to disabled peer
executives of the Company in effect immediately before the Termination Date.      The remaining provisions of this Agreement (including the
restrictive covenants in Article VIII) shall continue to apply.      4.10  Upon Death . If Executive s employment
is terminated by reason of Executive s death during a Post-Change Period, Imminent Control Change Period that culminates in a Change Date, Post-Significant Acquisition Period or Post-Disaggregation Period, the Company s
  
         30   

sole obligations to Executive and Executive s Beneficiary under Articles II, IV, and V shall be as follows, and such obligations shall be reduced by amounts paid or provided by the
Disaggregated Entity:      (a) to pay Executive s Beneficiary, pursuant to the Company s then-effective
Plans or, if the timing of payment is not governed by the terms of a Plan, within 30 days after the date of Executive s death, a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations; and   
  (b) to provide Executive s Beneficiary survivor and other benefits that are not less than the most favorable of such
benefits then available under Plans of the Company to surviving families of peer executives of the Company in effect immediately before the Executive s death, including retiree health care coverage under any Welfare Plan of the Company that
provides such coverage without regard to whether the Executive had satisfied the eligibility requirements for such coverage as of the date of his or her death.      4.11  Sole and Exclusive Obligations . The obligations of the Company under this Agreement with respect to any Termination of Employment of the Executive during the Post-Change Period, Imminent
Control Change Period, Post-Significant Acquisition Period, or Post-Disaggregation Period shall, except as provided in Section 4.2, supersede any severance obligations of the Company in any other plan of the Company or agreement between
Executive and the Company, including, without limitations, the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan under Section 4 or any other provision thereof, or any other plan or agreement (including an offer of employment or employment
contract) of the Company or any Affiliates which provides for severance benefits. In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity or conflict between the terms of such other plan of the Company or agreement between Executive and the Company and this
Agreement with respect to any severance obligations of the Company (other than obligations with respect to credited service under the SERP in any agreement other than a prior Change in Control Agreement entered into by and among Executive, Unicom
Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Company or PECO Energy Company), this Agreement shall govern.       Article V.    
   Certain Additional Payments by the Company       5.1  No Excise Tax Gross-Up .      (a) If it is determined by the Company s
independent auditors that any monetary or other benefit received or deemed received by Executive from the Company or any Affiliate thereof pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, whether or not in connection with a Change in Control (such monetary
or other benefits collectively, the   Potential Parachute Payments  ), is or would, if paid, become subject to any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax under any United States federal, state, local or
other law (such excise tax and all such similar taxes collectively,   Excise Taxes  ), then the total Potential Parachute Payments shall be reduced such that the value of the aggregate Potential Parachute Payments shall be one dollar
($1) less than the maximum amount which the Executive may receive without becoming subject to Excise Taxes (the   Capped Amount  ), and only the Capped Amount shall be paid. The tax (and
  
         31   

interest) imposed under Section 409A of the Code shall not be  any similar tax  for purposes of this Agreement.   
  (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(a), if receipt of the total Potential Parachute Payments without reduction would leave Executive
with a greater amount, after payment of Taxes and Excise Taxes with respect thereto, than payment of the Capped Amount after payment of Taxes with respect thereto, then the reduction described in Section 5.1(a) shall not be made.   
  (c) In the event payment of the Capped Amount is to be made, the Potential Parachute Payments shall be reduced or eliminated upon notice
by the Executive in writing delivered to the Company within 10 days of his receipt of the Company Certificate (or, if later within 10 days after his deliver of the Executive Certificate), or if the Executive fails to so notify the Company, then as
the Company shall reasonably determine, with regard for avoiding the imposition of taxes and interest payments under Section 409A of the Code, if possible, so that under the bases of calculations set forth in the Company Certificate (or, if
applicable, the Executive Certificate), there will be no amount subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. Such reduction shall be applied, to the extent necessary, first to any cash severance payments hereunder, followed by any
Annual Incentive payable for the year in which the Termination of Employment occurs, followed by any Performance Shares payable for such year or preceding years and then to any Options.   
  (d) The determination of the Company s independent auditors described in Section 5.1(a), including the detailed calculations of
the amounts of the Potential Parachute Payments, the Capped Amount, the amount of Excise Taxes and Taxes and the assumptions relating thereto, shall be set forth in a written certificate of such auditors (the   Company Certificate  )
delivered to Executive. Executive or the Company may at any time request the preparation and delivery to Executive of a Company Certificate. The Company shall cause the Company Certificate to be delivered to Executive as soon as reasonably possible
after such request.      5.2  Determination by Executive .   
  (a) If (i) the Company shall fail to deliver a Company Certificate to Executive within 30 days after its receipt of his written
request therefor, or (ii) at any time after Executive s receipt of a Company Certificate, Executive disputes any portion of the Company Certificate, then Executive may elect to deliver a determination (  Executive
Certificate  ) to the Company, setting forth Executive s determination as to whether Section 5.1(a) applies, and if so, the amount of the Capped Amount. If the Executive Certificate specifies that the Company is required to pay an
amount less than the amount specified in the Company Certificate, setting forth in detail how such lesser amount was determined, the Executive Certificate shall be controlling for all purposes. If the Executive Certificate specifies that the Company
is required to pay an amount greater than the amount specified in the Company Certificate, the Executive Certificate shall specify the full amount of the Potential Parachute Payments determined by Executive (together with the detailed calculations
of the Capped Amount, amounts of Excise Taxes and Taxes and the assumptions relating thereto) and shall be accompanied by an Executive Counsel Opinion (as defined in Section 5.3) regarding the applicability or inapplicability (as appropriate)
of the reduction described in Section 5.1(a) (such written notice and opinion collectively, the   Executive s Determination  ). Within 30 days after delivery of an Executive s Determination to
  
         32   

the Company, the Company shall either (i) pay Executive the full amount specified in the Executive s Determination (less the portion thereof, if any, previously paid to Executive by the
Company) or (ii) deliver to Executive a Company Certificate and a Company Counsel Opinion (as defined in Section 5.3), and pay Executive the amount specified in such Company Certificate. If for any reason the Company fails to comply with
the preceding sentence, the amounts specified in the Executive s Determination shall be controlling for all purposes.   
  (b) If Executive does not request a Company Certificate, the Company does not deliver a Company Certificate to Executive, and Executive
does not deliver an Executive Certificate to the Company, then the Potential Parachute Payments shall be made without regard to Section 5.1(a).      5.3  Opinion of Counsel .  Executive Counsel Opinion  means an opinion of nationally recognized executive compensation counsel to the effect (i) that the Capped Amount determined by
Executive pursuant to Section 5.2 is the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law
and (ii) if the Company has previously delivered a Company Certificate to Executive, that there is no reasonable basis or no substantial authority for the calculation of the Capped Amount set forth in the Company Certificate.   Company
Counsel Opinion   means an opinion of nationally recognized executive compensation counsel to the effect that the amount of the Capped Amount set forth in the Company Certificate is the amount that a court of competent jurisdiction, based on
a final judgment not subject to further appeal, is most likely to decide to have been calculated in accordance with this Article and applicable law, and that there is no substantial authority for the calculation set forth in the Executive s
Certificate.       Article VI.        Expenses, Interest and Dispute Resolution       6.1  Enforcement and Late
Payments .      (a) If, after the Agreement Date, Executive incurs reasonable legal fees or other expenses
(including arbitration costs and expenses under Section 6.3) in an effort to secure, preserve, or obtain benefits under this Agreement, the Company shall, regardless of the outcome of such effort, reimburse Executive (in accordance with
Section 6.1(b)) for such fees and expenses.      (b) Reimbursement of legal fees and expenses and gross-up
payments shall be made on a current basis, promptly after Executive s written submission of a request for reimbursement together with evidence that such fees and expenses were incurred.   
  (c) If Executive does not prevail (after exhaustion of all available judicial remedies) in respect of a claim by Executive
or by the Company hereunder, and the Company establishes before a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that Executive had no reasonable basis for Executive s claim hereunder, or for Executive s response to the
Company s claim hereunder, or that Executive acted in bad   
         33   

faith, no further reimbursement for legal fees and expenses shall be due to Executive in respect of such claim and Executive shall refund any amounts previously reimbursed hereunder with respect
to such claim.      6.2  Interest . If the Company does not pay any cash amount due to Executive under this Agreement within
three business days after such amount first became due and owing, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date it became due and owing until the date of payment at an annual rate equal to 200 basis points above the base commercial lending rate
published in  The Wall Street Journal  in effect from time to time during the period of such nonpayment.      6.3
 Arbitration . Any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties hereto arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement (other than disputes related to Article V or to an alleged breach of the covenant contained in
Article VIII) or any breach or alleged breach thereof, or any benefit or alleged benefit hereunder, shall be settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, before an impartial arbitrator pursuant to the rules and regulations of the American
Arbitration Association (  AAA  ) pertaining to the arbitration of labor disputes. Either party may invoke the right to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be selected by means of the parties striking alternatively from a panel of seven
arbitrators supplied by the Chicago office of AAA. The arbitrator shall have the authority to interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement, consistent with Section 10.12 below. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding
upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the highest court of a forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne according to Section 6.1. No arbitration shall be commenced after the
date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based upon such subject matter would be barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, either party may bring an action in the District Court of Cook County, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, if jurisdiction there lies, in order to maintain the status quo ante of the parties. The
 status quo ante  is defined as the last peaceable, uncontested status between the parties. However, neither the party bringing the action nor the party defending the action thereby waives its right to arbitration of any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of or in connection or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, either party may seek relief in the form of specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrator. The parties agree that in any arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to such discovery (including
depositions, requests for the production of documents and interrogatories) as would be available in a federal district court pursuant to Rules 26 through 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event that either party fails to comply with
its discovery obligations hereunder, the arbitrator shall have full power and authority to compel disclosure or impose sanctions to the full extent of Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   
   Article VII.        No Set-off or Mitigation    
         34   

7.1  No Set-off by Company . Executive s right to receive when due the payments
and other benefits provided for under this Agreement is absolute, unconditional and subject to no setoff, counterclaim or legal or equitable defense; provided, however that the Company shall have no further obligation to pay or provide severance
benefits under Article II, Article IV or Article V if at any time it determines, in accordance with the procedural requirements in Section 3.3, that in the course of his or her employment the Executive engaged in conduct described in
Section 3.3(a)(iii) or the last clause of Section 3.3(a)(iv), and all incentive compensation paid or payable hereunder shall be subject to any officer compensation recoupment policy as in effect on the Change Date. Time is of the essence
in the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement. Any claim which the Company may have against Executive, whether for a breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall be brought in a separate action or proceeding and not as
part of any action or proceeding brought by Executive to enforce any rights against the Company under this Agreement.      7.2
 No Mitigation . Executive shall not have any duty to mitigate the amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement by seeking new employment or self-employment following termination. Except as specifically otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid without reduction regardless of any amounts of salary, compensation or other amounts which may be paid or payable to Executive as the result of Executive s employment by
another unaffiliated employer or self-employment.       Article VIII.    
   Restrictive Covenants       8.1  Confidential Information . The Executive acknowledges that in the course of performing services for the Companies and Affiliates, he or she may create (alone or with others), learn of, have
access to and receive Confidential Information .  Confidential Information shall not include: (i) information that is or becomes generally known through no fault of Executive; (ii) information received from a third party outside of
the Company that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iii) information approved for release by written authorization of the Company. The Executive recognizes that all such Confidential Information is the sole
and exclusive property of the Company and its Affiliates or of third parties which the Company or Affiliate is obligated to keep confidential, that it is the Company s policy to keep all such Confidential Information confidential, and that
disclosure of Confidential Information would cause damage to the Company and its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that, except as required by the duties of Executive s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates and except in
connection with enforcing the Executive s rights under this Agreement or if compelled by a court or governmental agency, in each case provided that prior written notice is given to Company, Executive will not, without the written consent of
Company, willfully disseminate or otherwise disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information obtained during his or her employment with the Company or its Affiliates, and will take all necessary precautions to prevent disclosure, to
any unauthorized individual or entity inside or outside the Company, and will not use the Confidential Information or permit its use for the benefit of Executive or any other person or entity other than the Company or its Affiliates. These
obligations shall continue during and after the termination of Executive s employment   
         35   

(whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation).      8.2  Non-Competition . During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Termination Date, whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control
Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive hereby agrees that without the written consent of the Company Executive shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, in any capacity:   
  (a) engage or participate in, become employed by, serve as a director of, or render advisory or consulting or other
services in connection with, any Competitive Business; provided, however, that after the Termination Date this Section 8.2 shall not preclude Executive from being an employee of, or consultant to, any business unit of a Competitive Business if
(i) such business unit does not qualify as a Competitive Business in its own right and (ii) Executive does not have any direct or indirect involvement in, or responsibility for, any operations of such Competitive Business that cause it to
qualify as a Competitive Business.      (b) make or retain any financial investment, whether in the form of equity
or debt, or own any interest, in any Competitive Business. Nothing in this subsection shall, however, restrict Executive from making an investment in any Competitive Business if such investment does not (i) represent more than 1% of the
aggregate market value of the outstanding capital stock or debt (as applicable) of such Competitive Business, (ii) give Executive any right or ability, directly or indirectly, to control or influence the policy decisions or management of such
Competitive Business, and (iii) create a conflict of interest between Executive s duties under this Agreement and his or her interest in such investment.      8.3  Non-Solicitation . During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of any Termination Date, whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control
Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly:      (a) other than
in connection with the good-faith performance of his or her duties as an officer of the Company, cause or attempt to cause any employee or agent of the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company;   
  (b) employ, engage as a consultant or adviser, or solicit the employment or engagement as a consultant or adviser, of any
employee or agent of the Company (other than by the Company or its Affiliates), or cause or attempt to cause any Person to do any of the foregoing;      (c) establish (or take preliminary steps to establish) a business with, or cause or attempt to cause others to establish (or take preliminary steps to establish) a business with, any employee or agent of
the Company, if such business is or will be a Competitive Business; or   
         36   

(d) interfere with the relationship of the Company with, or endeavor to
entice away from the Company, any Person who or which at any time during the period commencing one year prior to the Termination Date was or is, to the Executive s knowledge, a material customer or material supplier of, or maintained a material
business relationship with, the Company.      8.4  Intellectual Property . During the period of Executive s employment
with the Company and any Affiliate, and thereafter upon the Company s request, whether or not after a Change in Control, Imminent Control Change, Significant Acquisition or Disaggregation, Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all
ideas, inventions and business plans that he or she makes, conceives, discovers or develops alone or with others during the course of his or her employment with the Company or during the one year period following Executive s Termination Date,
including any inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary
rights) (  Work Product  ) that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or
that may be used in relation therewith; or (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by
the Company. Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a  work made for hire  within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the
  Act  ). If and to the extent that any such Work Product is not a  work made for hire  within the meaning of the Act, Executive hereby assigns to the Company all right, title and interest in and to the Work Product, and all
copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive.
     (a) The Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for
which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executive s own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Company s business, or
(b) to the Company s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.   
  (b) Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his or her employment and
at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company, execute all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the
Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to prosecute or defend any
opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection, or otherwise in respect of the Work Product.
  
         37   

(c) In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to
secure Executive s execution as provided in subsection (b) above, whether because of Executive s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and
its duly authorized officers and agents as his or her agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his or her behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution,
issuance and protection of letters patent, copyright and other intellectual property protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.      8.5  Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants .      (a) Executive
acknowledges that the covenants contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are
reasonably necessary to protect the Company s legitimate interests in its Confidential Information and in its relationships with its employees, customers and suppliers. Executive further acknowledges such covenants are essential elements of
this Agreement and that, but for such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.      (b)
The Company and Executive have each consulted with their respective legal counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants. Executive acknowledges that Executive s observance of the covenants contained
in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 will not deprive Executive of the ability to earn a livelihood or to support his or her dependents.      8.6  Right to Injunction; Survival of Undertakings .      (a) In
recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in
money the damages which the Company would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his or her obligations under such Sections. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably injure the Company.
Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he or she breaches any of the provisions of such Sections, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an
injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law for
any such breach.      (b) If a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article VIII is
unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant s duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so
modified to be enforceable.   
         38   

(c) All of the provisions of this Article VIII shall survive any Termination
of Employment without regard to (i) the reasons for such termination or (ii) the expiration of the Agreement Term.      (d) The Company shall have no further obligation to pay or provide severance or benefits under Article II, Article IV, or Article V if a court determines that the Executive has breached any covenant in
this Article VIII.       Article IX.        Non-Exclusivity of Rights       9.1  Other Rights . Except as expressly
provided in Section 4.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit Executive s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other Plans provided by the Company and for which
Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with the Company. Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any
Plan and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Termination Date shall be payable in accordance with such Plan or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement.   
  9.2  No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee the right of Executive to continue in employment,
and the Company retains the right to terminate the Executive s employment at any time for any reason or for no reason.   
   Article X.    
   Miscellaneous       10.1  No Assignability . This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive s legal representatives.      10.2  Successors . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required
to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Any successor to the business or assets of the Company which assumes or agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, contract, or otherwise shall be jointly and severally liable with the
Company under this Agreement as if such successor were the Company.      10.3  Affiliates . To the extent that immediately
prior to the Applicable Trigger Date, the Executive has been on the payroll of, and participated in the incentive or employee benefit plans of, an Affiliate of the Company, the references to the Company contained in
  
         39   

Sections 2.8(a)(i) through (vii) and the other Sections of this Agreement referring to benefits to which the Executive may be entitled shall be read to refer to such Affiliate.
     10.4  Payments to Beneficiary . If Executive dies before receiving amounts to which Executive is entitled under this
Agreement, such amounts shall be paid in a lump sum to one or more beneficiaries designated in writing by Executive (each, a   Beneficiary  ) within 90 days after the date of Executive s death. If none is so designated, the
Executive s estate shall be his or her Beneficiary.      10.5  Payment of Reimbursable Expenses . Any reimbursement
(including any advancement) payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be conditioned on the submission by Executive of all expense reports reasonably required by the Company under any applicable expense reimbursement policy, and shall be
paid to the Executive within 30 days following receipt of such expense reports (or invoices), but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred the reimbursable expense. Any amount
of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligibility for reimbursement during any other calendar year. The right to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or
exchange for any other benefit.      10.6  Non-Alienation of Benefits . Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be
subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, before actually being received by Executive, and any such
attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable under this Agreement shall be void.      10.7  Severability . If any one
or more Articles, Sections or other portions of this Agreement are declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any Article, Section or other portion not so
declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Article, Section or other portion so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall be construed so as to effectuate the terms of such Article, Section or other portion to the fullest extent possible while remaining
lawful and valid.      10.8  Amendments  This Agreement shall not be amended or modified except by written instrument
executed by the Company and Executive.      10.9  Notices . All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and delivered by hand, by nationally-recognized delivery service that promises overnight delivery, or by first-class registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:   
  If to Executive, to Executive at his or her most recent home address on file with the Company.

     or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing. Notice and communications shall be effective when
actually received by the addressee.      10.10  Joint and Several Liability . The Company and the Subsidiary shall be jointly
and severally liable for the obligations of the Company, the Subsidiary, or the Employer hereunder.      10.11
 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.   
  10.12  Governing Law . This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois,
without regard to its choice of law principles.      10.13  Captions . The captions of this Agreement are not a part of the
provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.      10.14  Number and Gender . Wherever appropriate, the singular shall

Withholding . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive any Taxes the Company determines to be appropriate under applicable law and may report all such amounts payable to such
authority as is required by any applicable law or regulation.      10.16  Section 409A . This Agreement shall be
interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of additional taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code ( 409A Penalties ). In the event the terms of this Agreement would subject Executive to 409A Penalties,
the Company and Executive shall cooperate diligently to amend the terms of the Agreement to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. The payments to Executive pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement are intended to be exempt from
Section 409A of the Code to the   
         41   

maximum extent possible, under either the separation pay exemption pursuant to Treasury regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury regulation
 1.409A-1(b)(4), and for purposes of the separation pay exemption, each installment paid to Executive under Section 4 shall be considered a separate payment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if on the date of
Executive s Termination Date, (i) the Company is a publicly traded corporation and (ii) Executive is a  specified employee,  as defined in Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent any amount payable under this
Agreement constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, such
payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date or (B) the date of Executive s death.      10.17  No Waiver . Executive s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or any other provision of this
Agreement. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision, and any waiver of any default in any such provision shall not be deemed a waiver of any later default thereof or of any other provision.
     10.18  Entire Agreement . This Agreement, as amended and restated effective February 10, 2011, contains the entire
understanding of Company and Executive with respect to its subject matter.   
         42   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Executive and Exelon Corporation have executed this Change in Control
Employment Agreement effective as of February 10, 2011.
