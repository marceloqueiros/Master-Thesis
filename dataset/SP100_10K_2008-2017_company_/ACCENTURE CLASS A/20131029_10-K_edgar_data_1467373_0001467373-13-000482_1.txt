  Alliances  
  We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners  products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Most of our alliances are non-exclusive.

We also receive as reimbursement some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners to cover costs we incur for marketing and other assistance.  
  Research and Innovation  
  We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and development on which we spent $715 million, $560 million and $482 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively to help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions.     
  Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value. One component of this is our research and development organization, Accenture Technology Labs, which identifies and develops new technologies that we believe will be the drivers of our clients  growth and enable them to be first to market with unique capabilities. 
  We also promote the creation of knowledge capital and thought leadership through the Accenture Institute for High Performance. In addition, we spend a significant portion of our research and development investment directly through our operating groups and our consulting, technology and outsourcing growth platforms to develop market-ready solutions for our clients.  
  Employees  
  Our most important asset is our people. The diverse and global makeup of our workforce enables us to serve our diverse and global client base. We are deeply committed to the continued development of our employees, who receive significant and focused technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training appropriate for their roles and  
    8

   levels within our company throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees  commitments to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork.

  As of August 31, 2013, we had approximately 275,000 employees worldwide.  
  Competition  
  We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer. Our competitors include:  
             
    large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do; 
                
    off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, the Philippines and China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms;  
                
    accounting firms that have expanded or are in the process of expanding, including through acquisitions, their consulting services in areas that compete with us;  
                
    niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and

     Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:  
             
    skills and capabilities of people;  
                
    technical and industry expertise;  
                
    innovative service and product offerings;

    scope of services;

    Organizational Structure 
  Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than Class I common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares ( Accenture SCA ). Accenture plc s only business is to hold these  
    9 

     Table of Contents     

   shares. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA. As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plc s majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees.  
  History 
  Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA Class I common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. 
  On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the  Transaction ). The Transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009. 
  On December 1, 2012, we ceased using the designation  senior executive.  The majority of our leaders are now designated  managing directors,  and a select group of our most experienced leaders are  senior managing directors.  Managing directors and senior managing directors, along with members of the Accenture global management committee (the Company s primary management and leadership team, which consists of 17 of our most senior leaders), comprise  Accenture Leadership.   
  The selected financial data included in Item 6,  Selected Financial Data,  of this report with respect to periods prior to September 1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries. The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 6% as of August 31, 2013. 
  Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares 
  Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under   History,  Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. 
  Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc. 
  A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. 
  Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares 
  Only Accenture and the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA Class I common shares. Each Class I common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders  
    10 

     Table of Contents     

   of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments. As of October 15, 2013, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 94% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 6% of the voting interest held by the current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
  Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCA s articles of association. Under Accenture SCA s articles of association, the market value of a Class I common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i) the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the Class A ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii) if Accenture plc sells its Class A ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the Class A ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. In order to maintain Accenture plc s economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are issued. 
  Except in the case of a redemption of Class I common shares or a transfer of Class I common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCA s articles of association provide that Accenture SCA Class I common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA. In addition, all holders of Class I common shares (except Accenture) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA Class I common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holder s Accenture SCA Class I common shares in the tender offer). 
  Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares 
  Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA. 
    ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.  
  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients  businesses and levels of business activity. 
  Global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients  businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services. For example, revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due, in large part, to lower than expected demand, particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, such as certain countries in Europe and in Brazil. A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in Europe and North America. Weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, an economic slowdown in key emerging markets, where we typically grow faster than in more mature markets, also  
    11 

     Table of Contents     

   could adversely affect our results of operations, as we experienced. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. This could result, for example, in us having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.  
  Economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. 
  Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.  
  Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. In addition, as new technologies become available, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), which continually change the nature of our business, clients may slow spending on legacy technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies. Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days  notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, or delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays. 
  If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.       
  Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. As we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.   
  We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills. 
  Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our  
    12 

     Table of Contents     

   work profitably could suffer. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed, particularly in emerging markets. Therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.  
  Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected. 
  There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies. In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.  
  The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.  
  The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive. Our competitors include:  
             
    large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do; 
                
    off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, the Philippines and China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms;  
                
    accounting firms that have expanded or are in the process of expanding, including through acquisitions, their consulting services in areas that compete with us;  
                
    niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and 
                
    in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide. 
     Some competitors are companies that may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.  
  Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. For example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services. Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients. If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.

   We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.  
  We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.  
  In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. 
  Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.  
  Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data. Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients. These technologies, and others that may emerge, could reduce, and over time, replace some of our legacy business. In addition, we have seen some clients delaying spending under existing contracts and engagements and entering into new contracts more slowly while they evaluate the new technologies. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.  
  In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.  
  As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.  
  We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally, and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets. Our growth strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients  control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.  
  We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.    In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations. This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.

   International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.    Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients  levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.    We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.  
  In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.  
  Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us. In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.  
  Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.  
  Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located. Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control. For example, natural disasters of the type described above, some of which India and the Philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. Additionally, both India and the Philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes. India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully above, could significantly  
    15 

     Table of Contents     

   disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.  
  Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.  
  If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:  
             
    general economic and political conditions;  
                
    the competitive environment in our industry, as described below;  
                
    our clients  desire to reduce their costs;  
                
    our ability to accurately estimate, attain and sustain contract revenues, margins and cash flows over the full contract period, which includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our margins over long-term contracts; and  
                
    procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.  
     In addition, our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business, due to factors such as the mix of work and the number of service providers, among others. 
  The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share. Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.  
  If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable.  
  Our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions, which is based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable. Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract. We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, contracts used to deliver services and solutions for new technologies might necessitate the use of alternative pricing models, which could negatively impact our profitability. For example, in projects involving our SaaS solutions, revenue is typically generated on a usage basis, which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model. 
  Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.

   Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.  
  Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
             
    Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us, or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above, and may in the future experience adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations. 
                
    If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.  
                
    U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of  credible evidence  of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.  
                
    Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.  
                
    Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties. 
                
    Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., Congressional sequestration of funds under the Budget Control Act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the United States and Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.  
                
    Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed. 
                
    Legislative proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future. Various  
       17 

     Table of Contents     

   U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.  
  The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.  
  Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. 
  We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management s attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. 
  For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.  
  Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
  Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful.  
  As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, such as the Indian rupee, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks  
    18 

     Table of Contents     

   related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.   
  Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.    
  We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners. See  Business Alliances.  The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours. As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliances partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners. If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  Outsourcing services and the continued expansion of our other services and solutions into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services.  
  Outsourcing services, which represented approximately 46% of our net revenues in fiscal 2013, present different operational risks, when compared to our consulting and systems integration services. Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients  businesses, which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients. Disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our clients  businesses, expose us to claims, and harm our reputation and our business. 
  We have continued to expand our services and solutions into new business areas and provide services to new types of clients, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Expanding into new areas, and providing services to new types of clients may expose us to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas. We could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients.  
  We may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client. If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability. Many of our clients request that we obtain a Service Organization Control (SOC 1 type 2) audit prepared under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 and International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402, formerly referred to as SAS 70. If we receive a qualified opinion, or do not deliver the audit reports timely, our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.  
  Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.  
  We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.       Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.  
  In addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

   If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected.  
  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.  
  Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do. In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.  
  Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.  
  We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.  
  We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures.  
  We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities. We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture. Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. Business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. 
  We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. By their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position. This lesser degree  
    20 

     Table of Contents     

   of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. 
  Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.  
  Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations. These actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability. Over time, we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs. Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past. If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  
  Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.  
  Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients  actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.  
  Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  
  We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. Increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  
  Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.

   If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.  
  As of August 31, 2013, we had approximately 275,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients  sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we make changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted. 
  If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.  
  Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients. We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate, and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. We might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency. This could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. In addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested extended payment terms more frequently, and if this trend continues, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.  
  Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include:  
             
    changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business;  
                
    general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets;  
                
    announcements by us or competitors about developments in our business or prospects;  
                
    projections or speculation about our business or that of competitors by the media or investment analysts;  
                
    our ability to generate enough free cash flow to return cash to our shareholders at historical levels or levels expected by our shareholders; and  
                
    our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth and revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.  
     Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:  
             
    the business decisions of our clients to begin to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to changes in macroeconomic or political conditions unrelated to our business, general market conditions and new technologies;  
                
    periodic differences between our clients  estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work, as well as the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination or restructuring;  
                
    contract delivery inefficiencies, such as those due to poor delivery or changes in forecasts;  
                
    our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces;  
       22 

     Table of Contents     

acquisition, integration and operational costs related to businesses acquired;  
                
    the introduction of new products or services by us, competitors or alliance partners;  
                
    changes in our pricing or competitors  pricing;  
                
    our ability to manage costs, including those for our own or subcontracted personnel, travel, support services and severance;  
                
    our ability to limit and manage the incurrence of pre-contract costs, which must be expensed without corresponding revenues, which are then recognized in later periods without the corresponding costs; 
                
    changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition;  
                
    currency exchange rate fluctuations;  
                
    changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees; 
                
    global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism; and  
                
    seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations.  
     As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  our share price could be difficult to predict, and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future. In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.  
  Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.  
  The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.  
  We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results. 
  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.  
  We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the  
    23 

     Table of Contents     

   judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.  
  Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.  
  Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.  
  Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.  
  Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2012 of Ireland (the  Companies Acts ). The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.  
  Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.  
  We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders  ownership interest in us.  
  We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  
             
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  
                
    acquire other businesses or assets;  
                
    repurchase shares from our shareholders;  
                
    develop new services and solutions; or  
                
    respond to competitive pressures.  
     Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders  ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. 
    ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
  None. 
    ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES 
  We have major offices in the world s leading business centers, including Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Sao Paolo, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Rome, Bangalore, Beijing, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, among others. In total, we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world. We do not own any material real property. Substantially all of our office space is leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future. 
    ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. We do not expect that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
  We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

   ITEM 4.    MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
  Not applicable. 
    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT 
  Our executive officers and persons chosen to become executive officers as of the date hereof are as follows:

   ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We use the terms  Accenture,   we,  the  Company,   our  and  us  in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2013    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2013  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
  We use the term  in local currency  so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results  in local currency  are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
    Overview 
  Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients  current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
  Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide in many of the industries we serve, all of which are impacting, and we expect will continue to impact, our business. These conditions have impacted the types of services our clients are demanding. Clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and are placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and in some cases, slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts. These changing demand patterns are currently having an adverse impact on the timing of revenue and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. 
  Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   were   $7.09 billion  , compared with   $6.84 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  , an increase of   3.7%   in U.S. dollars and   4.5%   in local currency. Net revenues for   fiscal 2013   were   $28.56 billion  , compared with   $27.86 billion   for   fiscal 2012  , an increase of   3%   in U.S. dollars and   4%   in local currency. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Health   Public Service, Products, Financial Services and Communications, Media   Technology experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Resources was flat in local currency year-over-year. Revenue growth in local currency was solid in outsourcing, while consulting revenues reflected modest growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due, in large part, to lower than expected demand, particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, such as certain countries in Europe and in Brazil. We expect year-over-year revenues to range from a slight decline to a modest increase in the near term and continue to vary across operating groups and geographic regions, with growth in certain areas of our business partially offset by lower growth or declines in other areas. 
  In our consulting business, net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   were   $3.80 billion  , compared with   $3.74 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  , an increase of   2%   in U.S. dollars and   3%   in local currency. Net consulting revenues for   fiscal 2013   were   $15.38 billion  , compared with   $15.56 billion   for   fiscal 2012  , a decrease of   1%   in U.S. dollars and an increase of   1%   in local currency. Three of our five operating groups, including Health   Public Service, Communications, Media   Technology and Products, experienced quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency, while Resources and Financial Services experienced declines in quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue. We continued to enter into a higher proportion of contracts with longer duration that are converting to revenue at a slower pace, and clients slowed the pace and level of their spending. We expect these trends to continue in the near term. Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including analytics, cloud computing and mobility. Compared to fiscal 2012, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network, and we expect this trend to continue. The business environment is more competitive and, in some areas, we are experiencing pricing pressures.

   In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   were   $3.28 billion  , compared with   $3.10 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  , an increase of   6%   in U.S. dollars and   7%   in local currency. Net outsourcing revenues for   fiscal 2013   were   $13.18 billion  , compared with   $12.30 billion   for   fiscal 2012  , an increase of   7%   in U.S. dollars and   9%   in local currency. Health   Public Service, Financial Services and Products experienced strong year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media   Technology. Outsourcing revenue growth continued to be moderate, compared to the strong year-over-year growth that we experienced in the first half of   fiscal 2013  , as some clients slowed the pace and level of their spending and we expect these trends to continue in the near term. Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to   fiscal 2012  , we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. 
  As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to   fiscal 2012  , the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during   fiscal 2013  . This resulted in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately   1%   and   2%   lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the fourth quarter and   fiscal 2013  , respectively. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate the foreign-exchange impact to our fiscal 2014 revenue growth will be 1% lower growth in U.S. dollars than our growth in local currency. 
  The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals  time spent on billable work. Utilization for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   was approximately   88%  , flat with the   third quarter of fiscal 2013  , and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. 
  We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately   275,000   as of   August 31, 2013  , compared with approximately   266,000   as of   May 31, 2013   and approximately   257,000   as of   August 31, 2012  . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   was   12%  , flat with both the   third quarter of fiscal 2013   and the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2013 became effective September 1, 2012. As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; recover increases in compensation; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. 
  Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   was   33.2%  , compared with   32.9%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  . Gross margin for   fiscal 2013   was   32.9%  , compared with   32.3%   for   fiscal 2012  . The increase in gross margin for   fiscal 2013   was principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings. 
  Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   19.3%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  , compared with   19.1%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  . Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   18.6%   for   fiscal 2013  , compared with   18.4%   for   fiscal 2012  . Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For   fiscal 2013   compared to   fiscal 2012  , sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs. Our margins could

   be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues. 
  Operating expenses for   fiscal 2013   included reorganization benefits of   $274 million   as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, see Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  Operating income for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   was   $984 million  , compared with   $940 million   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  . Operating income for   fiscal 2013   was   $4,339 million  , compared with   $3,872 million   for   fiscal 2012  . Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   was   13.9%   compared with   13.8%   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  . Operating margin for   fiscal 2013   was   15.2%  , compared with   13.9%   for   fiscal 2012  . The reorganization benefits of   $274 million   recorded during the second and third quarters of   fiscal 2013   increased operating margin by   100   basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin would have been   14.2%   for   fiscal 2013  , an increase of   30   basis points compared with   fiscal 2012  . 
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2013   was   18.1%  . The above noted reorganization benefits increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Absent these items, our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2013   would have been   25.3%   compared with 27.6% in fiscal 2012. 
  Diluted earnings per share were   $4.93   for   fiscal 2013  , compared with   $3.84   for   fiscal 2012  . Absent the above noted reorganization benefits and tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2013, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.21 for   fiscal 2013  . 
  Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    Bookings and Backlog 
  New contract bookings for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013   were   $8.40 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $3.86 billion   and outsourcing bookings of   $4.54 billion  . New contract bookings for   fiscal 2013   were   $33.28 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $16.27 billion   and outsourcing bookings of   $17.01 billion  . 
  We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients continue to enter into contracts that are converting to revenue at a slower pace and clients have slowed the pace and level of their spending, all of which impact the conversion of new contract bookings to revenues. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
  The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. 
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. 
    34 

     Table of Contents     

   Revenue Recognition 
  Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. 
  We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. 
  Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. 
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs. 
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. 
  We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount  
    35 

     Table of Contents     

   of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. 
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. 
  Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. 
  Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 
  Income Taxes 
  Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. 
  We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 
  No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.

As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. 
    Revenues by Segment/Operating Group 
  Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are: Communications, Media   Technology; Financial Services; Health   Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. 
  From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. 
  While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

   The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for   fiscal 2013   compared to   fiscal 2012  : 
  Operating Groups 
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues decreased   2%   in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by growth in Americas across all industry groups and Media   Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a significant decline in Electronics   High Tech in EMEA, principally due to an expected year-over-year revenue decline from one contract. The revenue decline on this contract is expected to continue to impact outsourcing revenue growth in the near term. In addition, outsourcing revenue growth was impacted by a decline in Electronics   High Tech in Asia Pacific. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, due to declines in Communications and Media   Entertainment in Americas and Electronics   High Tech in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Electronics   High Tech in Americas. Some of our clients continued to reduce and/or defer their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues during fiscal 2013. We expect these trends will continue to impact our net revenue growth in the near term. 
                
    Financial Services net revenues increased   7%   in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas and Banking in EMEA, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenues reflected slight growth, with very strong growth driven by Insurance in Americas and Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. These increases were partially offset by declines in Insurance and Banking in EMEA and Banking in Americas. Changes in the banking and capital markets industries continue to influence the business needs of our clients. This is resulting in higher current demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. 
                
    Health   Public Service net revenues increased   12%   in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Asia Pacific and Health in Americas and EMEA. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA and Health in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues also reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Health in Americas and Asia Pacific. 
                
    Products net revenues increased   5%   in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Retail and Industrial Equipment. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Asia Pacific across most industry groups, Americas and EMEA in Retail, and Americas in Consumer Goods   Services. These decreases were largely offset by growth in Americas and EMEA in Life Sciences, Americas in Industrial Equipment and EMEA in Consumer Goods   Services. During fiscal 2013, several large systems integration projects ended, transitioned to smaller phases or to outsourcing services. We also had higher demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services and we expect this trend to continue in the near term. 
                
    Resources net revenues decreased   1%   in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by all industry groups in EMEA and Utilities and Energy in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, as growth in Chemicals across all geographic regions was more than offset by declines in Natural Resources in Asia Pacific and Americas, Utilities in EMEA and Energy in Americas. Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources and Utilities, reduced their level of consulting investments. In addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our outsourcing services has moderated. We expect these trends will continue to impact Resources year-over-year net revenue growth in the near term. 
     Geographic Regions 
             
    Americas net revenues increased   9%   in local currency, driven by growth in the United States. 
                
    EMEA net revenues were flat in local currency. We experienced a significant decline in Finland, principally due to an expected year-over-year decline from one contract in Communications, Media   Technology, as well as declines in Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These declines were offset by growth in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, South Africa and Italy. 
                
    Asia Pacific net revenues increased   3%   in local currency, driven by China, India, Singapore and Australia, partially offset by declines in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. 
     Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for   fiscal 2013   were   $26,056 million  , an increase of   $149 million  , or   1%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to   85.7%   from   87.0%   during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for   fiscal 2013   were   $24,224 million  , an increase of   $233 million  , or   1%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   84.8%   from   86.1%   during this period.

   Cost of Services 
  Cost of services for   fiscal 2013   was   $21,010 million  , an increase of   $220 million  , or   1%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to   69.1%   from   69.8%   during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for   fiscal 2013   was   $19,179 million  , an increase of   $304 million  , or   2%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   67.1%   from   67.7%   during this period. Gross margin for   fiscal 2013   increased to   32.9%   from   32.3%   during this period, principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings. 
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and marketing expense for   fiscal 2013   was   $3,482 million  , an increase of   $178 million  , or   5%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to   12.2%   from   11.9%   during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs. 
  General and Administrative Costs 
  General and administrative costs for   fiscal 2013   were   $1,836 million  , an increase of   $25 million  , or   1%  , from   fiscal 2012  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   6.4%   from   6.5%   during this period. 
  Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, net 
  We recorded net reorganization benefits of   $272 million   ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during   fiscal 2013   as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    
  Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Operating income for   fiscal 2013   was   $4,339 million  , an increase of   $467 million  , or   12%  , over   fiscal 2012  , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to   15.2%   from   13.9%   during this period. The reorganization benefits of   $274 million   recorded during   fiscal 2013   increased operating margin by   100   basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for   fiscal 2013   increased   30   basis points compared to   fiscal 2012  . 
   Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:

     During   fiscal 2013  , each operating group recorded a portion of the   $274 million   reorganization benefits. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for   fiscal 2013  , exclusive of the reorganization benefits, compared with   fiscal 2012  . See  Reorganization (Benefits), Costs, net.  
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income was also impacted by an expected significant year-over-year revenue decline from one outsourcing contract. 
                
    Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing and consulting contract profitability. Operating income for fiscal 2012 included the impact of costs related to acquisitions. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability. 
                
    Products operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline in consulting revenues. 
                
    Resources operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
     Interest Income 
  Interest income for   fiscal 2013   was   $33 million  , a decrease of   $10 million  , or   23%  , from   fiscal 2012  . The decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances. 
    
  Other (Expense) Income, net 
  Other (expense) income, net for   fiscal 2013   was   $18 million  , a decrease of   $23 million   from   fiscal 2012  . The change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during   fiscal 2013  , compared to net foreign exchange gains during   fiscal 2012  . 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2013   was   18.1%  , compared with   27.6%   for   fiscal 2012  . During   fiscal 2013  , we recorded reorganization benefits of   $274 million  , which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense. The effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for   fiscal 2013   would have been   25.3%  , which is lower than   fiscal 2012   primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves.

   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See  Business Organizational Structure.  The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for   fiscal 2013   was   $273 million  , an increase of   $1 million   over   fiscal 2012  . The increase was due to higher Net income of   $730 million  , offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to   7%   for   fiscal 2013   from   9%   for   fiscal 2012  . 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Diluted earnings per share were   $4.93   for   fiscal 2013  , compared with   $3.84   for   fiscal 2012  . The   $1.09   increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of   $274 million  , which increased earnings per share by   $0.38  , and the   $243 million   tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share by   $0.34  . Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share increased   $0.37   compared with earnings per share for   fiscal 2012  , due to increases of   $0.19   from higher revenues and operating results,   $0.13   from a lower effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits, and   $0.08   from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of   $0.03   from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

  Net Revenues 
  Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2012. All five of our operating groups experienced double-digit year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenue growth in local currency moderated significantly during the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012. While Health   Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2012, year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency either moderated or declined for all other operating groups in the second half of fiscal 2012. 
  The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011: 
  Operating Groups 
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, led by Electronics   High Tech in EMEA, principally due to a significant short-term increase from one contract. We also experienced outsourcing growth in Communications across all geographic regions. Consulting revenues declined slightly, with growth in the first half of fiscal 2012 offset by contraction during the second half of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, consulting revenues reflected a decline in Communications in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Media   Entertainment in Americas and Electronics   High Tech in Asia Pacific. Some of our clients, primarily in Communications, continued to exercise caution by reducing and/or deferring their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues.

       Table of Contents     

Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking. We also experienced outsourcing growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by significant growth in Insurance across all geographic regions, including the impact of an acquisition. This growth was partially offset by declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas and Capital Markets in EMEA. The uncertainty in the banking and capital markets industries impacted our consulting revenue growth during fiscal 2012. 
                
    Health   Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2011 reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. The global uncertainty and challenges in the public sector continued to have an impact on demand in our public service business. 
                
    Products net revenues increased 13% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased, driven primarily by growth across all industry groups in Americas and most industry groups in Asia Pacific. By industry group, growth was led by Retail and Industrial Equipment. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Air, Freight   Travel Services and Retail. 
                
    Resources net revenues increased 10% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased, driven by Energy across all geographic regions and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific and EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Natural Resources in Americas. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and all industry groups, led by Energy and Natural Resources.  
     Geographic Regions 
             
    Americas net revenues increased 13% in local currency, led by the United States and Brazil. In general, revenue growth moderated across Americas in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012. 
                
    EMEA net revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth in Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and South Africa. In general, revenue growth moderated across EMEA in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012. 
                
    Asia Pacific net revenues increased 18% in local currency, driven by Australia, Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea and India. 
     Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $25,906 million, an increase of $2,024 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.0% from 87.3% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 were $23,991 million, an increase of $1,954 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.1% from 86.4% during this period. 
  Cost of Services 
  Cost of services for fiscal 2012 was $20,790 million, an increase of $1,824 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 69.3% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 was $18,875 million, an increase of $1,754 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011, principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with investments in offerings and acquisitions, partially offset by higher contract profitability. 
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 was $3,303 million, an increase of $209 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to growth of business development costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues. 
  General and Administrative Costs 
  General and administrative costs for fiscal 2012 were $1,811 million, a decrease of $9 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.5% from 7.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, we recorded a provision for litigation matters for $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services.

   Operating Income and Operating Margin 
  Operating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million, an increase of $401 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.9% from 13.6% during this period. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: 

_______________  
           (1)  
    Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
     During fiscal 2012, the results of each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million provision for litigation matters, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, exclusive of these impacts. 
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased, primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, principally related to a significant short-term increase from one contract. 
                
    Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to a lower proportion of high margin consulting work, costs related to recent acquisitions and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by strong outsourcing revenue growth. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. Health   Public Service operating margin was impacted by administrative and compliance costs associated with our U.S. Federal practice. 
                
    Products operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved consulting and outsourcing contract profitability. 
                
    Resources operating income increased, primarily due to strong revenue growth. 
     Interest Income 
  Interest income for fiscal 2012 was $43 million, an increase of $1 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher cash balances. 
  Other Income, net 
  Other income, net for fiscal 2012 was $5 million, a decrease of $10 million from fiscal 2011. The change was driven primarily by lower net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 27.6%, compared with 27.3% for fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 included higher expenses for additions to tax reserves and changes in our geographic mix of income, partially offset by higher benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities.

   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See  Business Organizational Structure.  The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for   fiscal 2012   was $271 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from   fiscal 2011  . The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to   9%   for   fiscal 2012   from   10%   for   fiscal 2011  , partially offset by an increase in Net income of $272 million. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Diluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2012, compared with $3.39 for fiscal 2011. The $0.45 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of $0.40 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends. This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: 
             
    facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; 
                
    acquire complementary businesses or technologies; 
                
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or 
                
    develop new services and solutions. 
     As of   August 31, 2013  , cash and cash equivalents was   $5.6 billion  , compared with   $6.6 billion   as of   August 31, 2012  . 
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: 

_______________   
           (1) 
    Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
     Operating activities:   The reduction in operating cash flow included the impact of a discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2013, which had a net impact of $350 million, after tax. The reduction in operating cash flow was also due to other changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher net income. 
  Investing activities:   The   $621 million   increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    46 

     Table of Contents     

   Financing activities:   The   $507 million   increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of ordinary shares and an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders  Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
    
  Borrowing Facilities 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:

           (1) 
    This facility, which matures on   October 31, 2016  , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , we had no borrowings under the facility. 
              (2) 
    We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , we had no borrowings under these facilities. 
              (3) 
    We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , we had no borrowings under these various facilities. 
     Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of   $179 million   and   $164 million   of letters of credit outstanding as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of   $25.60 million   and   $0.03 million   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively.

   Share Purchases and Redemptions 
  The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. As of   August 31, 2013  , our aggregate available authorization was   $1,964 million   for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs. 
  Our share purchase activity during fiscal   2013   was as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. 
              (2) 
    During fiscal   2013  , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 
              (3) 
    Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
     We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal   2014  . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. 
  Other Share Redemptions 
  During fiscal   2013  , we issued   11,019,187   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the  registration statement ). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
    Subsequent Developments 
  On   September 25, 2013  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of   $0.93   per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on   October 11, 2013  . Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of   $0.93   per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on   October 8, 2013  . Both dividends are payable on   November 15, 2013  . 
  On September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.96 billion.

   Obligations and Commitments 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
              (2) 
    Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. 
              (3) 
    Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. 
              (4) 
    Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. 
  Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount. 
  For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 
  To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2013, we early adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately, by item, reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  In September 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, which are now presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated Shareholders  Equity Statements, under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance for our fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  New Accounting Pronouncement 
  In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts offset and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for Accenture beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time we will include the required disclosures. 
    ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. 
  Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of   August 31, 2013  , it was anticipated that   $177 million   of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.

We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately   $309 million   and   $402 million   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of   August 31, 2013   is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. 
  Equity Price Risk 
  The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

    ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
           i. 
    pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
              ii. 
    provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and 
              iii. 
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
     Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
  Accenture plc  : 
  We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Shareholders  Equity Statements, and Consolidated Cash Flows Statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013. We also have audited Accenture plc s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Accenture plc s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Description of Business 
  Accenture plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc seeks to deliver competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance. Accenture plc s global delivery model enables it to provide an end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the  Company ). Accenture plc s only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares. The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture plc controls Accenture SCA s management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCA s results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interest percentages were   6%   and   8%   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis. 
  All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Company s fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2013    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2013  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Company s fiscal year. 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates. 
  Fiscal 2012 income tax amounts in certain line items within cash flows from operating activities in the Company s Consolidated Cash Flows Statement have been revised. These revisions were not material and had no impact on reported Net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, certain other amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2013 presentation. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If the Company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. 
  Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, the Company s efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting  
    F- 9

  ACCENTURE PLC 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 
  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

   contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned. 
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, the Company s effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned. 
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were   $539,048   and   $538,638   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were   $515,578   and   $551,364   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.   
  The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Company s accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above. Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company s control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements. 
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. 
  Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 
  Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements 
  Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.

   Income Taxes 
  The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. 
  Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts 
  Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of   $650,000   and   $1,265,000   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. Cash and cash equivalents also includes restricted cash of   $45,132   and   $27,982   as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which primarily relates to cash held to meet certain insurance requirements. As a result of certain subsidiaries  cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.  
  Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances 
  The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were   $91,716   and   $64,874  , respectively. The allowance reflects the Company s best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services. In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  The Company s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited. 
  Investments 
  All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90 days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments. Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income. Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in Other (expense) income, net. The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.

   Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: 
                 Buildings 
    20 to 25 years 
      Computers, related equipment and software 
    2 to 7 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    5 to 10 years 
      Leasehold improvements 
    Lesser of lease term or 15 years 

Long-Lived Assets 
  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  Selected components of operating expenses were as follows:

     Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2013, the Company early adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately, by item, reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In September 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB, which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, which are now presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated Shareholders  Equity Statements. 
  In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The Company adopted this new guidance for its fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   2.    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests other,  since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. 
              (2) 
    Fiscal   2012   and   2011   diluted weighted average Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the   fiscal 2013   payment of cash dividends. This did not result in a change to previously reported Diluted earnings per share.

   3.    REORGANIZATION (BENEFITS) COSTS, NET 
  In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure. These included liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable. Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments. 
  The Company s reorganization activity was as follows: 

As a result of final determinations, certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with the Company's transition to a corporate structure in 2001 are no longer probable. Accordingly, the Company recorded reorganization benefits of   $273,945   during fiscal   2013  . These benefits were partially offset by interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities of   $1,903  . As of   August 31, 2013  , reorganization liabilities of   $5,080   were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of   $13,381   were included in Other non-current liabilities. Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authority s decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Company s Consolidated Income Statement. As of   August 31, 2013  , only a small number of countries remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations.

   6.    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL 
  On July 8, 2013, the Company acquired Acquity Group Ltd. ( Acquity ), a provider of strategy, digital marketing and technical services, for   $282,985  , net of cash acquired. This acquisition expanded Accenture s range of digital marketing services and resulted in more than   600   Acquity employees joining Accenture. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of   $215,979  , which was allocated to the Products, Communication, Media   Technology and Financial Services reportable segments, and intangible assets of   $55,972  , primarily related to customer relationships and technology-related assets. The goodwill is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The intangible assets are being amortized over   one   to   ten   years. The pro forma effects on the Company s operations were not material. 
  During fiscal   2013  , the Company also completed other individually immaterial acquisitions, including a provider of clinical and regulatory information management solutions and software for the pharmaceutical industry and a provider of loan origination software and electronic document management services, for total consideration of   $521,003  . These acquisitions were completed primarily to expand the Company s products and services offerings. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of   $405,151  , which was allocated among the reportable operating segments, and intangible assets of   $122,012  , primarily related to customer relationships and technology-related assets. Goodwill also included immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The intangible assets are being amortized over   one   to   fifteen   years. The pro forma effects on the Company s operations were not material. 
  During fiscal 2012, the Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions, including a provider of residential and commercial mortgage processing services, for total consideration of   $174,383  . In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of   $123,817  , which was allocated among the reportable operating segments, and intangible assets of   $57,732  , primarily related to customer relationships. Goodwill also included immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions. The intangible assets are being amortized over   three   to   seven   years. The pro forma effects on the Company s operations were not material. 
  During fiscal 2011, the Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions, including a provider of software solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry, for total consideration of   $306,187  . In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of   $254,975  , which was allocated among the reportable operating segments, and intangible assets of   $81,735  , primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of less than   one   to   fifteen   years. The pro forma effects on the Company s operations were not material. 
  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  . 
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment were as follows:

   7.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement. 
  Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Company s derivative financial instruments, was approximately   $4,805   as of   August 31, 2013  . 
  The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce the Company s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Company s realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in the Company s credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Company s realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of   August 31, 2013   was   $418,697  . 
  The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Company s Global Delivery Network. To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges. 
  In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Company s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item. The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter. 
  For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders  Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net loss of   $49,954   and   $55,068   during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a net gain of   $21,753   during fiscal 2011. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011  , was not material. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011  . As of   August 31, 2013  ,   $177,201   of net unrealized losses related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.

   Other Derivatives 
  The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of   $142,432   and   $153,913   for fiscal   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

   8.    BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , the Company had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: 

_______________  
           (1) 
    This facility, which matures on   October 31, 2016  , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The Company continues to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , the Company had no borrowings under the facility. 
              (2) 
    The Company maintains separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of the Company s operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , the Company had   no   borrowings under these facilities. 
              (3) 
    The Company also maintains local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access the Company s global facilities. As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , the Company had   no   borrowings under these various facilities. 
       
  Under the borrowing facilities described above, the Company had an aggregate of   $179,186   and   $164,121   of letters of credit outstanding as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. In addition, the Company also had total outstanding debt of   $25,600   and   $33   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively.

_______________  
           (1) 
    The fiscal 2012 U.S. federal and U.S. state and local current and deferred tax expense reflects the impact of a discretionary cash contribution of   $500,000   made to the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2013.

   The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following: 

The Company recorded valuation allowances of   $204,561   and   $221,015   as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal   2013  , the Company recorded a net decrease of   $16,454   in the valuation allowance, primarily due to the realization of foreign tax credits. 
  The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of   August 31, 2013   of   $724,484  . Of this amount,   $142,937   expires between   2014 and 2023  ,   $30,061   expires between   2024 and 2033  , and   $551,486   has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of   August 31, 2013   of   $94,417  , of which   $26,269   will expire between   2014 and 2023  ,   $10,405   will expire between   2024 and 2033  , and   $57,743   has an indefinite carryforward period. 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , the Company had   $1,263,070   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $647,208  , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate. As of   August 31, 2012  , the Company had   $1,604,745   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $813,721  , if recognized, would favorably affect the Company s effective tax rate. The differences of   $615,862   and   $791,024  , respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.

   A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: 

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011  , the Company recognized (benefit) expense of   $(46,602)  ,   $(98,765)   and   $59,950   in interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $119,937   (  $100,939  , net of tax benefits) and   $171,556   (  $125,993  , net of tax benefits) on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , respectively. 
  The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2010 to 2011. The audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2006 to 2009 closed during fiscal 2013. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2006. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $732,000   or increase by approximately   $112,000   in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on   $2,847,544   of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability. 
  Portions of the Company s operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal   2014 and 2017  . Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, with renewal periods through   2027  . The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately   $84,000  ,   $84,000   and   $72,000   in fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011  , respectively.

   10.    RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS 
  Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
  In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The defined benefit pension disclosures include the Company's U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. 
  Postemployment Plans 
  Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. These costs are not material and are substantially provided for on an accrual basis. 
  Assumptions 
  The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense for the subsequent year were as follows: 

The Company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S. Plans is to match the plans  cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Company s defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio. 
  Pension Expense 
  Pension expense for fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011   was   $91,771  ,   $102,555   and   $110,332   respectively.

   Investment Strategies 
  U.S. Pension Plans 
  The overall investment objective of the plans is to provide growth in the defined benefit pension plans  assets to help fund future defined benefit pension obligations while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations. The plans  future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Company s current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans  ability to meet their current benefit obligations. The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans  assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans  investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing. 
  Non-U.S. Pension Plans 
  Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded. 
  Risk Management 
  Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities. To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation. Plan asset allocation and investment managers  guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis. 
    
  Plan Assets 
  The Company s target allocation for fiscal   2014   and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of   August 31, 2013 and 2012   by asset category, for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:

   Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. 
  The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels: 
             
    Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
                
    Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. 
       
  The fair values of defined benefit pension plan assets as of   August 31, 2013   were as follows: 

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during   fiscal 2013  .

   Expected Contributions 
  Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements. The Company estimates it will pay approximately   $66,644   in fiscal   2014   related to contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners. The Company has not determined whether it will make additional voluntary contributions for its defined benefit pension plans.  
    
  Estimated Future Benefit Payments 
  Benefit payments for defined benefit pension plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: 

Defined Contribution Plans 
  In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined contribution plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. Defined contribution plans in countries other than the United States and the United Kingdom are individually immaterial. Total expenses recorded for the United States and the United Kingdom defined contribution plans were   $248,242  ,   $255,606   and   $235,439   in fiscal   2013, 2012 and 2011  , respectively. 
    11.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Share Incentive Plans 
  On   February 6, 2013   the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan (the  Amended 2010 SIP ), which the Board of Directors of Accenture approved on   December 6, 2012  . The Amended 2010 SIP is substantially the same as the Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan (the  2010 SIP ), except that it was amended to authorize an additional   24,000,000   shares and expressly prohibit the repricing of options and share appreciation rights. The 2010 SIP was originally approved by the Company's shareholders on February 4, 2010. No new awards were granted under the 2001 Share Incentive Plan (the  2001 SIP ) on or after February 4, 2010, and any share capacity remaining under the 2001 SIP was cancelled and not incorporated in the 2010 SIP. However, outstanding awards granted under the 2001 SIP, before the approval of the 2010 SIP, continue to be satisfied from shares authorized under the 2001 SIP. 
  The Amended 2010 SIP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture and provides for the grant of nonqualified share options, incentive stock options, restricted share units and other share-based awards. A maximum of   74,000,000   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are currently authorized for awards under the Amended 2010 SIP. As of   August 31, 2013  , there were   37,517,583   shares available for future grants under the Amended 2010 SIP. Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares covered by awards that terminate, lapse or are cancelled may again be used to satisfy awards under the Amended 2010 SIP. The Company issues new Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and shares from treasury for shares delivered under the Amended 2010 SIP.  
    
  A summary of information with respect to share-based compensation is as follows:

   Restricted Share Units 
  Under the Amended 2010 SIP, participants may be, and previously under the 2001 SIP participants were, granted restricted share units, each of which represents an unfunded, unsecured right, which is nontransferable except in the event of death of the participant, to receive an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the date specified in the participant s award agreement. The fair value of the awards is determined on the grant date based on the Company s stock price. The restricted share units granted under these plans are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging from   two   to   seven   years. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting term of each separately vesting portion. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. Restricted share unit activity during fiscal   2013   was as follows: 

_______________ 
    As of   August 31, 2013  , there was   $623,117   of total restricted share unit compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.4   years. As of   August 31, 2013  , there were   1,520,776   restricted share units vested but not yet delivered as Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. 
    
  Stock Options 
  Stock options may be granted to members of Accenture Leadership and other employees under the Amended 2010 SIP and were previously granted under the 2001 SIP. Options generally have an exercise price that is at least equal to the fair value of the Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on the date the option is granted. Options granted under the Amended 2010 SIP and previously under the 2001 SIP are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging from   two   to   five   years, and generally have a contractual term of   10   years. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of each separately vesting portion. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. The fair value of each options grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Stock option activity for fiscal   2013   was as follows:

In addition, the Company's consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that the Company's solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which the Company agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. 
  Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim. Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount. 
  As of   August 31, 2013 and 2012  , the Company s aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately   $748,000   and   $596,000  , respectively, of which all but approximately   $15,000   and   $21,000  , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties that are the consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 
  To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. 
  Legal Contingencies 
  As of   August 31, 2013  , the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.

    Upon termination of Employment, the Employee will receive payment in respect of any holiday entitlement which has accrued under clause 10.1 but which has not been taken.

The Employee accordingly agrees that, to the extent required by applicable law, and in order to comply with the Tax Equalisation Policy with respect to making tax equalisation payments and otherwise, the UK tax withholding (PAYE) that would normally apply to the Employee will cease for the duration of any overseas assignment and be replaced with hypothetical tax withholding corresponding to the UK income tax and National Insurance contributions that the Employee would have paid had he / she remained in the UK (as more fully defined in the Tax Equalisation Policy).   
       
           24.3

    that, after his / her tax returns are prepared, the difference between the hypothetical tax and the actual tax due from the Employee will be computed and the final tax due from the Employee will be settled promptly thereafter; 
       
           (c) 
    that the Employee will comply with all UK and foreign laws regarding personal income tax and social security contributions; 
       
           (d) 
    that the Employee will be responsible and liable for the submission of all required tax returns in the UK and the host location, although the Company will provide assistance to the Employee in accordance with the Tax Equalisation Policy; and 
       
           (e) 
    to provide the Company upon request with copies of his / her completed tax returns for the period during which the Employee works overseas, and the Employee agrees that this obligation will survive termination of the Employment. 
       
           24.5 
    The Employee agrees that, both during the Employment and after its termination, he / she is under an obligation to cooperate with the Company and any relevant Affiliate in ensuring full compliance with the terms of the Tax Equalisation Policy, including but not limited to cooperating in filing all required tax returns, and refunding any overpayments of tax which are due to the Company or any Affiliate under the Policy.  The Employee also agrees that the Company will be entitled at any time during his / her employment, or in any event on termination, to deduct from his / her remuneration or from any other monies due from him / her to the Company or any Affiliate any amounts owing from him / her as a result of the application of the Company s Tax Equalisation  

Policy, whether in respect of hypothetical tax withholding, overpayments of tax or otherwise, or any losses suffered by the Company or any Affiliate on account of the Employee s failure to comply fully with the Tax Equalisation Policy. 
    
           24.6 
    The Employee agrees that, if any amounts remain owing after termination of employment, or if the Company or any Affiliate suffers losses on account of the Employee s failure to comply with the Tax Equalisation Policy, and the Company or any Affiliate does not or is unable to recover the full amount of those losses by making deductions from the Employee s remuneration or from any other monies due to him / her from the Company or any Affiliate, the Employee will pay to the Company or any Affiliate on demand and in full a sum equal to any amounts owing or any losses suffered by it.  The Employee agrees that this sum will be recoverable as a debt, together with all costs, including legal costs, incurred by the Company or any Affiliate in recovering the sum.  The Employee agrees that this obligation will survive the termination of his / her employment with the Company for any reason.

Dear Pam: 
    
  Your retirement from Accenture comes with much appreciation for the contributions to our growth and success during your 34-year career with Accenture (the  Company ).  This letter describes certain terms of your retirement.  
    
    As is the case with all retirees, and except as otherwise provided in this letter, any benefits payable to you in connection with your retirement will be paid or made available in accordance with the applicable terms of the employee benefit plans of the Company in which you participate (as such plans may be amended or terminated from time to time). 
    
    1.        Resignation from Offices; Retirement  .  As previously announced, you stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on July 1, 2013 and will retire effective August 31, 2013 (the  Retirement Date ).   
    
    2.        Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards  .  Following your retirement, your outstanding equity awards granted pursuant to the Company s 2010 Share Incentive Plan will be treated as follows: 
    
  a.        2011-2013 Senior Officer Performance Equity Award Restricted Share Units  .  The Company has amended the terms of your 2011, 2012 and 2013 Senior Officer Performance Equity Award Agreements to provide that any service-based vesting conditions with respect to such awards will be deemed fully satisfied immediately prior to the Retirement Date, and you will receive the shares underlying such awards upon the regularly scheduled settlement dates for continuing employees subject to the terms of the applicable award agreements. 
    
  b.        2012 and 2013 Key Executive Performance-Based Award Restricted Share Units  .  The Company has amended the terms of your 2012 and 2013 Key Executive Performance Based Award Agreements to provide that any service-based vesting conditions with respect to such awards will be deemed fully satisfied immediately prior to the Retirement Date, but any performance-based vesting conditions with respect to such awards will continue to apply following your retirement such that you will be eligible to receive shares, if any, that are earned in respect of your Key Executive Performance-Based Award Restricted Share Units upon the regularly scheduled settlement dates for continuing employees subject to the terms of the applicable award agreements.   
    
  c.        Other Outstanding Equity Awards  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 2, the terms and conditions applicable to your outstanding equity awards will be governed  

pursuant to the applicable award agreements, and such awards will either become vested or forfeited (and/or remain exercisable or lapse, in the case of stock option awards) in accordance with such award agreements.  For the avoidance of doubt, your unvested matching awards under the Company s Voluntary Equity Investment Program will be forfeited in accordance with their terms upon the Retirement Date. 
    
    3.        Payment of 2013 Annual Bonus  .  You will remain eligible to receive your regular annual cash bonus (to the extent earned) in respect of the Company s 2013 fiscal year, with such bonus amount to be determined in accordance with your performance and payable at the same time when bonuses are determined and paid to the Company s other Accenture Leaders in the ordinary course.  
    
    4.        Payment in Lieu of 2014 Equity Grants  .  In recognition of your performance and services for the Company during its 2013 fiscal year, the Company will pay you an equivalent cash amount (the  2014 Cash Payment ) in lieu of receiving regular 2014 equity grants under the Company s Senior Officer Performance Equity Program and Leadership Performance Equity Program (the  2014 RSU Grants ).  The 2014 Cash Payment will be determined and paid to you at the same time when the 2014 RSU Grants would have been determined and granted to you in the ordinary course if you had remained employed through such dates (with such determination to be made in October 2013, and payment currently anticipated to be made in January 2014); provided that in the event that the Company reasonably determines that you have not complied with the restrictive covenants applicable to you under your equity award agreements or employment agreements with the Company and its affiliates, as may be amended or modified from time to time, the Company will be relieved of its obligation to make the 2014 Cash Payment and, to the extent that such amount has already been paid to you, you will be required to promptly repay such 2014 Cash Payment to the Company. 
    
    5.        Office Space  .  The Company will provide you with a furnished office and administrative support following your Retirement Date until December 31, 2013.

The Company may require you to remit amounts necessary to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations, or may otherwise withhold against amounts otherwise payable to you to satisfy such obligations.       
    
  We thank you again for your service to the Company and wish you the very best in the future. 

Sincerely,

INTRODUCTION 
    
  Accenture LLP ( Accenture ) adopted this restated Accenture LLP Leadership Separation Benefits Plan (f/k/a the Accenture LLP Senior Executive Separation Benefits Plan) (the  Program ), originally effective as of April 15, 2010 (the  Effective Date ), for the benefit of the Eligible Employees.  The Program is hereby restated effective as of December 1, 2012.  The Program is an unfunded welfare benefit plan for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (hereinafter  ERISA ), a severance pay plan within the meaning of Department of Labor Reg.   2510.3-2(b) and an involuntary separation pay program under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).  Except as otherwise set forth in this document, the Program supersedes each prior Accenture severance plan, program or policy covering an Eligible Employee, both formal and informal, including, but not limited to, the Accenture United States Separation Benefits Plan.  The purpose of the Program is to provide an Eligible Employee who is involuntarily terminated from Accenture with Separation Benefits.  This document serves as both the plan document and summary plan description under ERISA. 
  ELIGIBILITY 
    
  An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant, and shall receive Separation Benefits subject to the terms and conditions of the Program, if the Eligible Employee s employment with Accenture is involuntarily terminated in connection with the Program and the Eligible Employee submits (and does not later revoke) a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture by the stated deadline below.   
  In no event, however, will an Eligible Employee become a Participant in the Program if any of the following applies to the Eligible Employee: 
             
    the Eligible Employee s employment is terminated for Cause; 

the Eligible Employee is offered a Comparable Position with Accenture (or an Affiliate) prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date; 

the Eligible Employee s employment terminates because of his voluntary termination, job abandonment, death, or any reason other than in connection with the Program; 

the Eligible Employee requests to return to employment with Accenture following an unpaid leave of absence or a period of long-term disability, and Accenture determines that there are no available positions for which the Eligible Employee is qualified; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to an Eligible Employee returning from a leave of absence which has a legally-protected status (such as Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave); 

in connection with a business transaction involving Accenture or an Affiliate (including, without limitation, a sale of assets of Accenture, an outsourcing transaction, or a contractual arrangement with a third party), the Eligible Employee is offered a position with the other party to the transaction (or one of its affiliates) prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date; 

the Eligible Employee becomes eligible to receive long-term disability benefits from Accenture; or 

the Eligible Employee fails to comply with any condition set forth in the Program.   
       
  All determinations of eligibility for the Program shall be made by Accenture in its sole discretion. 
  PARTICIPATION 
    
  Only Participants are eligible for Separation Benefits.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Program, a Participant whose employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with the Program shall be entitled to the Separation Benefits set forth in the applicable appendix.  Eligible Employees will be required to sign a Separation Agreement and all other documentation to become a Participant and receive Separation Benefits.  Eligible Employees shall also be required to sign a document entitled  Amendment to Restricted Share Unit and Other Grant Agreements  that shall be included in the Participant s departure documentation.  Eligible Employees shall be advised to consult a personal attorney to review the Separation Agreement.   
  An Eligible Employee must submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture not earlier than his or her Termination Date and not after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement.  An Eligible Employee may have a right to revoke the Separation Agreement.  If such a right exists, it shall be set forth in the Separation Agreement.  Any such revocation must be in writing and must be received by Accenture during the time frame set forth in the Separation Agreement.  An Eligible Employee who chooses not to submit a signed Separation Agreement to Accenture or who effectively revokes the signed Separation Agreement, shall nonetheless terminate employment as of his or her Termination Date but will not be eligible to receive Separation Benefits.  As noted above, Separation Agreements will not be accepted prior to an Eligible Employee s Termination Date nor after the deadline set forth in the Separation Agreement. 
  Signed Separation Agreements (and any other accompanying documents to be signed) must be faxed to Accenture Exit Services Team at (312) 737-9391, scanned and emailed to Accenture.Exit.Team or mailed to the following address: 
    Accenture Exit Services Team 
  c/o HR Transactions 
  6415 Babcock, Suite 100 
  San Antonio, TX 78249-2963 
    
  In the event an Eligible Employee breaches the provisions of the Separation Agreement, the payment of Separation Benefits shall cease and Accenture shall exercise, and the Eligible Employee shall be bound by, the remedies provided in the Separation Agreement. 
  SEPARATION BENEFITS 
    
  An Eligible Employee who complies with each term in this Plan and each term in the Separation Agreement shall be entitled to the following Separation Benefits. 
  Separation Pay 
  he amount of Separation Pay that a Participant shall be entitled to receive depends upon the circumstances of the Participant s termination and his or her Years of Service, as described in the charts below.   

Standard Package 
  Each Participant terminated other than for Performance Reasons shall be entitled to receive Separation Pay which shall consist of (1) a base benefit determined by the Participant s career level as of the Termination Date, (2) a variable benefit based on the Participant s Years of Service, and (3) a COBRA Payment (more fully described below).  The total amount of a Participant s base and variable benefits are subject to a maximum as set forth below. 
                     Base Benefit 
    Variable Benefit 
    Maximum Total of Base and Variable Benefits 
    COBRA Payment 
      6 Months of Pay 
    1 Week of Pay for each complete Year of Service (rounded down to last complete Year of Service) 
    8 Months of Pay 
    $12,000 

Performance Package 
  Each Participant terminated for Performance Reasons shall be entitled to receive Separation Pay as outlined below:   

Unless otherwise required by law and except as provided in the following sentence, Separation Pay shall be paid in a single lump sum on the next regular payroll date following the date Accenture receives the signed Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the signed Separation Agreement, the next regular payroll date following the date the applicable revocation period expires (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter in accordance with Accenture s payroll procedures).  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, elect to provide the Separation Pay on a payroll-by-payroll basis in lieu of a single lump sum.  If a Participant dies before receiving full payment of his Separation Pay, such amounts will be paid to his estate. 
  If a Participant is on a short-term disability ( STD ) leave as of his or her Termination Date or was scheduled to commence an STD leave no later than thirty (30) days following his or her Termination Date, the Participant s Separation Pay also shall include additional Weeks of Pay (as described below) for the lesser of (i) the number of weeks (if any) remaining in the paid-time portion of his or her scheduled STD leave, or (ii) six (6) weeks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of weeks in (or remaining in) the paid-time portion of a Participant s scheduled leave is not known prior to the payment of his or her Separation Pay, the Participant shall receive six (6) Weeks of Pay.  For purposes of this paragraph only, a  Week of Pay  means a Participant s STD pay as determined by Accenture in accordance with Accenture s Short-Term Disability Leave Policy, as amended from time to time. 
  Professional Outplacement Services 
  As additional consideration for signing and not later revoking the Separation Agreement, each Participant, including a Participant terminated for Performance Reasons, shall be entitled to participate in a senior executive Professional Outplacement Services program to be provided by an outside firm selected by Accenture.  Each Participant shall receive from Accenture separate, detailed information about the  

Professional Outplacement Services program, including the duration of the program, the types of available services, how to enroll, and the locations of available programs.  No Participant may receive cash in lieu of the Professional Outplacement Services.  A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program in order to participate; enrollment is not automatic.  A Participant may enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program not before the later of the date the Participant submits the Separation Agreement or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, upon expiration of the applicable Separation Agreement.  A Participant must enroll in the Professional Outplacement Services program no later than sixty (60) days after the Termination Date or, in the case of a Participant entitled to revoke the Separation Agreement, no later than sixty (60) days after the date the revocation period expires. 
  COBRA Payment 
  The Participant shall be entitled to receive the COBRA Payment whether or not the Participant is enrolled for coverage in the Active Medical Plan and/or Dental Plan and whether or not the Participant elects COBRA Continuation Coverage.  To receive COBRA Continuation Coverage, a Participant must elect such coverage in accordance with the terms of the Active Medical Plan and/or Dental Plan and otherwise comply with the terms and conditions that apply.   
  Equity Compensation 
  A Participant s termination of employment affects his or her rights and responsibilities under the various forms of equity compensation received during employment.  These may include Founders Shares, Promotion Awards, Celebratory Awards, awards under the Bonus Share Program and may include restricted stock units and stock options.  The type of award, the Participant s age and the date the equity was awarded, among other factors, may all be relevant for determining how termination of employment affects equity compensation.  Each Participant should review the terms of the applicable equity compensation plan document and grant agreements to determine how termination of employment affects equity compensation.   
  RETURN OF ACCENTURE PROPERTY/TIME REPORTS 
    
  As a condition of receiving Separation Benefits under the Program, an Eligible Employee must return to Accenture all Accenture property (e.g., building keys, credit cards, documents and records, identification cards, office equipment, portable computers, car/mobile phones, parking cards, computer diskettes).  In addition, the balance of any expense against an Eligible Employee s Accenture personnel number must be zero, an Eligible Employee must submit final time reports, submit all outstanding expense receipts, and have no balance on any Accenture related credit cards or credit accounts, including but not limited to a Corporate American Express card.  If an Eligible Employee has a credit card or credit account balance, the Plan Administrator may require such Eligible Employee to pay the entire outstanding balance in full within sixty (60) days of the Termination Date before he or she may be entitled to receive Separation Benefits.  Any Accenture property must be returned to Accenture no later than the Eligible Employee s Termination Date. 
  Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) the amount of any Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Program by any disability, severance, separation, termination pay, or pay-in-lieu of notice amounts that Accenture pays or is required to pay to the Participant through insurance or otherwise under any plan or contract of Accenture (including the amount of any compensation payable and the value of any benefits to be provided during any notice period under an employment agreement with Accenture or any Affiliate) or under any federal  

or state law (other than unemployment compensation). In addition, Accenture reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount of Separation Benefits payable to a Participant under the Program by the amount, if any, that the Participant owes Accenture (or an Affiliate). 
  PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT, PERFORMANCE AND COOPERATION 
    
  As a condition of receiving any Separation Benefits under the Program, each Eligible Employee must:  (i) continue to exhibit professional conduct in the workplace; (ii) adhere to all Accenture practices and policies; (iii) perform his or her regular job duties and responsibilities in accordance with required performance standards; (iv) successfully transition job activities; and (v) cooperate with Accenture personnel in matters relating to his or her position or termination.  If an Eligible Employee does not comply with the foregoing requirements during and after the remainder of his or her employment, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, such Eligible Employee shall forfeit all benefits under the Program. 
  REEMPLOYMENT 
    
  If a Participant accepts a job offer from Accenture or an Affiliate after his Termination Date, but prior to payment of his Separation Benefits, the Participant shall not be entitled to receive Separation Benefits.  If a Participant is re-employed by Accenture or an Affiliate after receiving Separation Pay, he must repay to Accenture an amount equal to his Separation Pay but not the cost of any Professional Outplacement Services.  Such repayment must be made within fifteen (15) days following reemployment (or such later date as may be specified by Accenture).  A Participant will not, however, be required to repay Separation Pay in the following circumstances: 
             
    A Participant will not be required to repay any portion of the Separation Pay if Accenture decides not to apply this requirement to such Participant.  Accenture has complete discretion to decide whether (and to what extent) to require repayment by any particular Participant, taking into account, among other things, the best interests of Accenture and its Affiliates. 

A Participant will not be required to repay his Separation Pay if such Participant is rehired by Accenture or an Affiliate after a period equal to the total number of weeks represented by that Participant s Separation Pay.  If a Participant is rehired by Accenture or an Affiliate prior to expiration of the period equal to the total number of weeks represented by that Participant s Separation Pay, the Participant shall be required to repay a prorated portion of that Participant s Separation Pay.  
       
  REPAYMENTS AND FORFEITURES 
    
  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Program, a Participant shall reimburse Accenture for the full amount of Separation Benefits received by the Participant under the Program if the Participant subsequently discloses any of Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) trade secrets, violates any written covenants or agreements with Accenture or an Affiliate, including but not limited to non-compete and non-solicitation provisions in any employment or equity agreement, or otherwise engages in conduct that may adversely affect Accenture s (or an Affiliate s) reputation or business relations. In addition, any Participant described in the preceding sentence shall forfeit any right to benefits under the Program that have not yet been paid. Accenture shall take such steps as it deems necessary or desirable to enforce the provisions of this subsection. 

ADMINISTRATION 
    
  Accenture is responsible for the administration and operation of the Program.  Accenture is the Program s  plan administrator  and  named fiduciary  (within the meaning of such terms under ERISA).  Accenture may adopt from time to time such rules as may be necessary or desirable for the proper and efficient administration of the Program and as are consistent with the terms of the Program.  These rules will be applied on a uniform basis to similarly situated individuals.  In administering the Program, Accenture shall have the authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to construe and interpret the provisions of the Program and to make factual determinations thereunder, including the discretionary authority to determine the eligibility of employees (or other individuals) and the amount of benefits payable under the Program.  Any decisions made by Accenture shall be final and conclusive with respect to all questions concerning the Program.  No benefits will be provided to any individual under the Program unless Accenture decides in its sole discretion that the individual is entitled to benefits under the Program.  Accenture may delegate to one or more of its employees or other persons the responsibility for performing Accenture s powers, rights, and duties under the terms of the Program and may seek such expert advice as Accenture deems necessary with respect to the Program. 
  GENERAL 
    
  Information to be Furnished by Participants  .    Each Participant must furnish to Accenture such documents, evidence, data, or other information as Accenture considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the Program.  Benefits under the Program for each Participant are provided on the condition that the Participant will furnish full, true, and complete data, evidence, or other information and that the Participant will promptly sign any document required under the Program or requested by Accenture. 
  Employment Rights  .    The Program does not constitute a contract of employment and participation in the Program will not give a Participant the right to be rehired or retained in the employ of Accenture on any basis, nor will participation in the Program give any Participant any right or claim to any benefit under the Program, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Program. 
  Decision Final  .    Any interpretation of the Program or any decision on any matter within the sole discretion of Accenture made by Accenture is binding on all persons. 
  Evidence  .    Evidence required of anyone under the Program may be by certificate, affidavit, document, or other information which the person relying thereon considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made, or presented by the proper party or parties. 
  Gender and Number  .    Where the context permits, words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 
  Controlling Laws  .    Except to the extent superseded by ERISA, the internal laws of the State of Illinois shall apply to all matters related the Program (including questions of conflicts of law). 
  Interests Not Transferable  .    Except as otherwise set forth in this document, the interests of persons entitled to benefits under the Program are not subject to their debts or other obligations and, except as may be required by the tax withholding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any state s income tax act, or pursuant to an agreement between a Participant and Accenture, may not be voluntarily sold, transferred, alienated, assigned, or encumbered. 

Mistake of Fact  .    Any mistake of fact or misstatement of fact shall be corrected when it becomes known and proper adjustment made by reason thereof.  A Participant must repay to Accenture any benefits paid under this Program by mistake of fact or law. 
  Severability  .    In the event any provision of the Program is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Program, and the Program shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provisions had never been included in the Program. 
  Withholding  .    Accenture reserves the right to withhold from any amounts payable under this Program all federal, state, city, and local taxes as shall be legally required, as well as any other amounts authorized or required by Accenture policy including, but not limited to, withholding for garnishments and judgments or other court orders. 
  Effect on Other Plans  .    Payments or benefits provided to a Participant under any deferred compensation, savings, retirement, or other employee benefit plan of Accenture are governed solely by the terms of such plan.  Nothing in this Program shall limit Accenture s right to, at any time or for any reason, modify, amend, or terminate any of Accenture s employee benefit or compensation plans, programs, policies, or arrangements. 
  Unfunded Benefit  .    All benefits payable under this Program shall be paid directly by Accenture out of its general assets.  Accenture shall not be required to segregate on its books or otherwise any amount to be used for the payment of benefits under this Program. 
  Amendment and Termination 
  Accenture reserves the right to amend the Program at any time and to alter, reduce, or eliminate any benefit under the Program (in whole or in part) at any time or to terminate the Program at any time, as to any class or classes of employees (including former employees), without prior notice.  Any amendment of the Program may be made by proper action of an officer of Accenture.  No employee, officer, director, or agent of Accenture has the authority to alter, vary, or modify the terms of the Program, except by means of an authorized amendment to the Program.  No verbal or written representations contrary to the terms of the Program and its proper amendments shall be binding upon Accenture or the Program. 
  BENEFIT CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
    
  No person needs to apply for benefits under the Program.  However, if a Participant wishes to file a claim for benefits, he or she (or his or her authorized representative) may make a claim by filing a written description of the claim with Accenture.  Accenture will notify the claimant in writing if the claim is granted.  If the claim is denied, Accenture will notify the claimant of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the denial, references to the Program provisions on which the denial is based, additional information necessary to perfect the claim, if any, and a description of the procedure for review of the denial.  Any written claim decision will be sent to the claimant within 90 days (or 180 days if extension is warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture received the claim. 
  A claimant may request a review of a complete or partial denial of the claim for benefits.  Any such request must be in writing and must be received by Accenture within 60 days after the claimant received the notice of the denial of the claim.  The claimant will be entitled to review pertinent Program documents and submit written issues and comments to Accenture.  Within 60 days (or 120 days if extension is warranted by special circumstances) after Accenture receives the request for review, Accenture will furnish the claimant with written notice of its decision, setting forth the specific reasons for the decision and references to the pertinent Program provisions on which the decision is based. 

No person may challenge a decision of Accenture in court or in any other administrative proceeding unless he or she has complied with the claim and appeal procedures described above and such procedures have been completed.  If a claim for benefits is finally denied by Accenture, the claimant may only bring suit in court (or other administrative proceeding) if he or she files such action within 120 days after the date of the final denial of the claim by Accenture.  No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under this Program until the appeal rights herein provided have been exercised and the Program benefits requested in such appeal have been denied in whole or in part. 
  All decisions and communications to Participants or other persons regarding a claim for benefits under the Program shall be held strictly confidential by the Participant (or other claimant), Accenture, and their agents.

  Each Participant in the Program is entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that Participants will be entitled to: 
             
    Examine, without charge, at Accenture s offices, all documents governing the Program, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series) filed by Accenture with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. 

Upon written request to Accenture, obtain copies of documents governing the operation of the Program, a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 series), and an updated summary plan description.  Accenture may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
       
  In addition to creating rights for Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Program.  The people who operate the Program, called  fiduciaries  of the Program, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of the Participants.  No one, including Accenture or any other person, may fire any person or otherwise discriminate against a person in any way to prevent him or her from obtaining a benefit or exercising his or her rights under ERISA.  If a claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, the claimant has the right to know why this was done, obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
  Under ERISA, there are steps a person can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if a person requests a copy of the Program documents or the Program s latest annual report from Accenture and such person does not receive them within thirty days, he or she may file suit in a federal court.  In such case, the court may require Accenture to provide the requested materials and pay such person up to $110 per day until he or she receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of Accenture.  If a person has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, he or she may file suit in a state or federal court.  If it should happen that the fiduciaries misuse a plan s money, or if he or she is discriminated against for asserting his or her rights, he or she may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or may file suit in a federal court.  The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If a person is successful in the lawsuit, the court may order the person sued to pay these cost fees.  If the person filing the lawsuit loses, the court may order that person to pay these costs and fees; for instance, if it finds the claim to be frivolous. 

If a person has any questions about the Program, he or she should contact Accenture.  If that person has any questions about this statement or about ERISA, he or she should contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, listed in the telephone directory, or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  A person also may obtain certain publications about the rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

 GLOBAL ANNUAL BONUS PLAN

ACN.8.31.2013 10-K Exhibit 10.49 

Exhibit 10.49 
    
  Global Annual Bonus Plan 
  Summary of Terms 
    
  1.   Objective  : The objective of the Accenture Annual Bonus Plan (the  Plan ) is to provide the Participants (as defined below) of Accenture plc (the  Company ) and its eligible affiliates with performance incentive awards (each an  award ) based upon the Company s annual performance and to promote further alignment of the interests of the Participants with those of the Company and its shareholders.  
    
  2.   Term  : The plan shall be in effect beginning with the 2013 fiscal year and remain in effect for each following fiscal year, unless otherwise cancelled or replaced by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Compensation Committee ).  
    
  3.   Eligibility  : Employees of the Company and its eligible affiliates and certain other consulting service providers deemed eligible, at the Company s sole discretion, are eligible to participate in the Plan (the  Participants ). To receive an award, a Participant must be employed by or otherwise providing services to the Company (or an eligible affiliate) as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year during the term of the Plan. The Compensation Committee (or its designee) may, in its sole discretion, provide partial awards to Participants that commence providing services subsequent to the first day of the applicable fiscal year.  
    
  4.   Target Levels for Award/Calculations  : The Compensation Committee shall approve annual earnings targets prior to the end of the first quarter of the applicable fiscal year during the term of the Plan based on the Company s operating plan. The Compensation Committee shall also approve a range of potential award amounts for threshold, target and above-target performance. Based upon management s quarterly review, the Company shall book an accrual based upon the achievement of performance target levels. The Compensation Committee may adjust up or down the earnings target and ranges for potential awards under the Plan or, alternatively, may adjust the calculation of actual earnings for purposes of the Plan, in each case to reflect items outside of the Participants  control as the Compensation Committee deems necessary, advisable or appropriate to adequately reward and incentivize the Participants. Such items may include, without limitation, incurrence of non-operating income items, release of reorganization liabilities or changes in the effective tax rate. The final determination of the earnings target, potential award ranges, the certification of earnings target attainment for the purposes of the Plan and the annual accrual shall be approved by the Compensation Committee prior to payment. The earnings achieved by the Company for the purposes of the Plan may differ from earnings amounts reflected in the Company s financial statements.  
    
  5.   Performance Goals  : Each Participant shall be assigned a target award level, stated as a percentage of that Participant s designated base earnings. Each Participant s ability to earn his or her target award is dependent on the Company s attainment of annual earnings targets. A Participant may earn more or less than his or her target award based upon his or her individual annual performance ratings.  
    
  6.   Award Payments  : All award payments under the Plan will be paid out in cash, annually, following the completion of the fiscal year, and where practical during the calendar year in which the Plan year ends.  
    
  7.   Termination  : In the event that any Participant shall cease to provide services to the Company or its eligible affiliate prior to the end of the applicable fiscal year, subject to legal requirements, that Participant will not be entitled to an award for that fiscal year. The Plan shall not give any person any right to be retained in the service of the Company or any of its affiliates.  
    
  8.   Amendments  : The Compensation Committee may, at any time and from time to time, make any and all amendments to the Plan as it deems necessary, advisable or appropriate, and may terminate the Plan at any time.  
    
  9.   Administration  : Except as determined by the Board of Directors, the Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for (a) determining the annual earnings targets under the Bonus Plan prior to the end of the first fiscal quarter of the Bonus Plan year; (b) certifying the Company s achievement with respect to the earnings target following completion of the Bonus Plan year; and (c) approving the Company s accrual under the Bonus Plan.  The Compensation Committee has full authority, in its discretion, to take any action with respect to the Plan including, without limitation, (i) to determine all matters relating to awards, including eligibility criteria, performance criteria, the achievement of performance criteria, and terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations of any award, and (ii) to construe and interpret the Plan and any instruments evidencing awards granted under the Plan, the establishment and interpretation of rules and regulations for administering the Plan and all other determinations deemed (in the Compensation Committee s discretion) necessary, advisable or appropriate for administering the Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate authority to implement the Plan and to  

make certain modifications with respect thereto for purposes of such implementation on a global, per country or per participant basis, as the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, deem necessary, advisable or appropriate.

 ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACN.8.31.2013 10-K Exhibit 99.1 

Exhibit 99.1 
  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Participants of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, and the changes in its financial status for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

      ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued) 

1.    PLAN DESCRIPTION 
  The following description of the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  Plan ) is provided for general information purposes. Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information. Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the  VEIP ). 
  General 
  Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the  Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the  Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company is authorized to issue or transfer up to   45,000,000   Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.  The Company pays all expenses of the Plan. The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired. 
  The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date. 
  The  fair market value  on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used. 
  In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). The Plan does not currently qualify as an  employee stock purchase plan  under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant. The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
  Contributions 
  Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as is permitted by the Committee. Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is   10%   (up to a maximum of   $7,500   per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000. Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their total compensation towards the purchase of Shares. The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period. Individual participation is subject to an aggregate participation limit based on a percentage of total eligible participant compensation as defined by the Plan and permitted by the Committee. The aggregate participation limit percentage was 11% prior to July 25, 2012 at which time the Committee resolved to increase the percentage to 15%. If aggregate compensation is projected to reach this cap, then contributions will stop and participants would be refunded contributions not used to purchase shares. 
    
  A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the applicable offering period as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced. All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account under the Plan and are deposited with the general funds of the Company. All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment. Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal   2013   included the six-month periods ended   November 1, 2012   and   May 1, 2013  . The current offering period commenced on May 2,   2013   and will end on November 1,   2013  . The VEIP has a calendar year offering period and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5   th    of the subsequent month.

Share Purchases 
  As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name. Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested. A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:

Withdrawals 
  Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law). A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal. A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
  Adjustments 
  The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan (or pursuant to outstanding awards) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any option as of the date of consummation of the change in control. 
  Plan Amendment and Termination 
  The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan, or without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan. The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. The Board has not amended the Plan, except as noted in Note 1 nor initiated actions to terminate the Plan.
