PART I 
    
  ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
    
  (a) General Development of the Business 
    
  Colgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Colgate ) is a leading consumer products company whose products are marketed in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world. Colgate was founded in 1806 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1923. 
    
  For recent business developments and other information, refer to the information set forth under the captions  Executive Overview and Outlook,   Results of Operations,   Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 
    
  (b) Financial Information about Segments 
    
  Worldwide Net sales and Operating profit by business segment and geographic region during the last three years appear under the caption  Results of Operations  in Part II, Item 7 of this report and in Note 15, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  (c) Narrative Description of the Business 
    
  The Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Colgate is a global leader in Oral Care with the leading toothpaste and manual toothbrush brands throughout many parts of the world according to market share data. Colgate s Oral Care products include Colgate Total, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, Colgate Max Fresh, Colgate Optic White and Colgate Luminous White toothpastes, Colgate 360  and Colgate Slim Soft manual toothbrushes and Colgate Optic White, Colgate Total and Colgate Plax mouthwash. Colgate s Oral Care business also includes pharmaceutical products for dentists and other oral health professionals. 
    
  Colgate is a leader in many product categories of the Personal Care market with global leadership in liquid hand soap, which it sells under the Palmolive, Protex and Softsoap brands. Colgate s Personal Care products also include Palmolive, Sanex and Softsoap brand shower gels, Palmolive, Irish Spring and Protex bar soaps and Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Sanex deodorants and antiperspirants. Colgate is the market leader in liquid hand soap in the U.S. with its line of Softsoap brand products according to market share data. Colgate s Personal Care business outside the U.S. also includes Palmolive and Caprice shampoos and conditioners. 
    
  Colgate manufactures and markets a wide array of products for the Home Care market, including Palmolive and Ajax dishwashing liquids, Fabuloso and Ajax household cleaners and Murphy s Oil Soap. Colgate is a market leader in fabric softeners with leading brands including Suavitel in Latin America and Soupline in Europe. Colgate is a market leader in fabric softeners in the South Pacific according to market share data. 
    
  Sales of Oral, Personal and Home Care products accounted for   46%  ,   21%   and   20%  , respectively, of the Company s total worldwide Net sales in   2014  . Geographically, Oral Care is a significant part of the Company s business in Asia,     comprising approximately   86%   of Net sales in that region for   2014  . 
    
     1 

Colgate, through its Hill s Pet Nutrition segment (     Hill s     ), is a world leader in specialty pet nutrition products for dogs and cats with products marketed in over 95 countries worldwide. Hill s markets pet foods primarily under three trademarks: Hill s Science Diet, which is sold by authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians for everyday nutritional needs; Hill s Prescription Diet, a range of therapeutic products sold by veterinarians and authorized pet supply retailers to help nutritionally manage disease conditions in dogs and cats; and Hill     s Ideal Balance, a range of products with natural ingredients, sold by authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. Sales of Pet Nutrition products accounted for   13%   of the Company s total worldwide Net sales in   2014  . 
    
  For more information regarding the Company s worldwide Net sales by product category, refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations and Note 15, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  For additional information regarding market share data, see      Market Share Information      in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 
    
  Research and Development 
    
  Strong research and development capabilities and alliances enable Colgate to support its many brands with technologically sophisticated products to meet consumers  oral, personal and home care and pet nutrition needs. The Company s spending related to research and development activities was   $277 million   in   2014  ,   $267 million   in   2013   and   $259 million   in   2012  . 
    
  Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents 
    
  The Company s products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of the Company s sales. 
    
  The majority of raw and packaging materials are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of the Company s total material requirements. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities such as   resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans   are subject to market price variations. 
    
  The Company s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. Products similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of the Company s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain of the Company s product lines. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the Company s operating segments. 
    
  Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Company s business. The Company follows a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where the Company s products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, elmex, Tom s of Maine, Sanex, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill s Science Diet, Hill s Prescription Diet and Hill     s Ideal Balance. The Company s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although the Company actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  The Company has programs that are designed to ensure that its operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable environmental rules and regulations. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities totaled $41 million for   2014  . For future years, expenditures are currently expected to be of a similar magnitude. For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
     2 

Employees 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014  , the Company employed approximately 37,700 employees. 
    
  Executive Officers of the Registrant 
    
  The following is a list of executive officers as of February 19, 2015:   

Each of the executive officers listed above has served the registrant or its subsidiaries in various executive capacities for the past five years with the exception of Jennifer M. Daniels, who joined the Company in 2014 as Chief Legal Officer and Secretary. Ms. Daniels joined the Company from NCR Corporation where she was Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Prior to joining NCR Corporation in 2010, Ms. Daniels was Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Barnes   Noble, Inc., which she joined in 2007. 
    
  Under the Company s By-Laws, the officers of the corporation hold office until their respective successors are chosen and qualified or until they have resigned, retired or been removed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company (the      Board     ). There are no family relationships between any of the executive officers, and there is no arrangement or understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was elected.

    ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  Set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities.  These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the below risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline. 
    
  We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. 
    
  We operate on a global basis with approximately   80%   of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to: 

changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets, 
                
    exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas, 
                
    political or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil, 
                
    lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operate, 
                
    foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, and 
                
    other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, labor laws, profit controls or other government controls. 
     These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
  In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. 
     4 

For example, the Company s ability to manage its Venezuelan operations has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by difficult conditions in Venezuela, including the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013 and the effective devaluations that occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system in 2014. Since April 2012, when price controls affecting most of our Venezuelan subsidiary s ( CP Venezuela ) product portfolio became effective, we have not been able to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited our ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. In addition, labor laws limit our ability to manage overhead costs and, at times, production at CP Venezuela has been negatively impacted by local labor issues. Going forward, additional government actions, including in the form of further currency devaluations or effective devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls, foreign exchange, price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government take-over could have further adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as could economic instability resulting from the decline in the price of oil. For additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in Venezuela, refer to Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview and Outlook  and Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. 
    
  We face vigorous competition worldwide, including from local competitors and other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. We face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the pricing of products, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent, trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors. 
    
  We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  Our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad. 
    
  Our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising and sale. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. Also, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad. 
    
  New or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in Europe, the U.S. and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products. Triclosan, an ingredient used by us primarily in Colgate Total toothpaste and certain other oral care products, is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide. Triclosan is currently being evaluated under the European Union s Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the European Union by 2018. In the U.S., the FDA is evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride (an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products) and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers. In 2014, a law banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan was passed in Minnesota, but the law does not cover Colgate Total toothpaste. Similar legislation has been proposed in Iowa, New York and Michigan, while legislation seeking to ban the sale of all consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed in Chicago, Illinois. Environment Canada, the federal environmental authority in Canada, is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in March 2015. Depending on the findings in the final assessment, it is possible that Environment Canada will issue voluntary or mandatory risk management measures for triclosan. A decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan, or any other of our ingredients, should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients.  Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business.     
     5 

Because of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the  FCPA ) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  While it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3  Legal Proceedings  and   Note 13  , Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business. 
    
  Uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. 
    
  While we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit. Recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  Increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. 
    
  Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. 
    
  We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. For example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines, including liquid hand soaps and shower gels. The emergence of new sales channels, such as sales via e-commerce, may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

The growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products. 
    
  Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions. The identification, development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully: 

identify, develop and fund technological innovations, 
                
    obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others, 
                
    obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad, and 
                
    anticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferences. 
       
  The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  If, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.  
    
  We may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 Restructuring Program. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, we commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program for sustained growth, which was expanded in the fourth quarter of 2014 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities (as expanded, the  2012 Restructuring Program ). The 2012 Restructuring Program s initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. The successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 Restructuring Program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases requires successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not be able to continue to realize the anticipated benefits from the 2012 Restructuring Program. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 Restructuring Program, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, refer to Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Executive Overview and Outlook  and    Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges.

Volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability. 
    
  Raw and packaging material commodities such as   resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans   are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain key materials, including the triclosan used in Colgate Total toothpaste, we use single-source suppliers. In addition, for certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. While we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints, climatic events such, as droughts or hurricanes, and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials, and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business. 
    
  Maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our Ethics and Compliance, Sustainability, Brand Protection and Product Safety, Regulatory and Quality initiatives.   
    
  In addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  Similarly, adverse publicity about us, our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns, legal or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts, including packaging, energy and water use and waste management, or other sustainability issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation. 
    
  Our business is subject to product liability, false advertising and consumer fraud claims. 
    
  From time to time, we may be subject to product liability claims alleging, among other things, that our products cause damage to property or persons, provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants. In addition, from time to time, we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers, including consumer class actions, alleging that our product claims are deceptive or that our ingredient or content labeling is defective. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. For example, as described in Item 3  Legal Proceedings,  we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos, causing harm to consumers. In addition, if one of our products, or a raw material contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products. Whether or not a product liability, false advertising or consumer fraud claim is successful, or a recall is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. 
    
     8 

There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. 
    
  We develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics. The achievement of our funding-the-growth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Executive Overview and Outlook.  
    
  Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities. 
    
  We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. We are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: 

industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues, 
                
    environmental events,  
                
    strikes and other labor disputes, 
                
    disruptions in logistics,  
                
    loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,  
                
    raw material and product quality or safety issues,  
                
    the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets, and  
                
    natural disasters, including climatic events and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. 
     While we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  A breach of information security, a cyber-security incident or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation. 
    
  We rely extensively on information technology systems, including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors, in order to conduct our business.  Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: 

communicating within the Company and with other parties, 
                
    ordering and managing materials from suppliers, 
                
    converting materials to finished products, 
                
    receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers, 
                
    marketing products to consumers,  
        9 

collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, 
                
    processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll and employee benefits, 
                
    hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, 
                
    complying with legal, regulatory or tax requirements, 
                
    providing data security, and  
                
    handling other processes involved in managing our business. 
     Although we have network security measures in place, our information technology systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our third-party service providers  databases or systems. If we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive, and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, civil litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance, failure or cyber-attack of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events, and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
    
  Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management. 
    
  Our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. 
    
  We may acquire or divest brands or businesses, which could adversely impact our results. 
    
  We may pursue acquisitions of brands or businesses from third parties.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired brands or businesses, estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management s attention from other business priorities, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. 
    
  Moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs, all of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
    
  We also may periodically divest brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures.  In addition, businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

     11 

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  As a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, the Company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings. These include disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Management proactively reviews and monitors the Company s exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is party to various environmental matters and, as such, may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites. 
    
  The Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. 
    
  The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates. For those matters disclosed below, the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is $  0   to approximately $  200   million (based on current exchange rates). The estimates included in this amount are based on the Company s analysis of currently available information and, as new information is obtained, these estimates may change. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the matters in question. Thus, the Company s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above. 
    
  Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year.

Brazilian Matters 
    
  There are certain tax and civil proceedings outstanding, as described below, related to the Company     s 1995 acquisition of the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (the      Seller     ). 
    
  The Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, at the current exchange rate, are approximately $  107   million. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority s appellate process since October 2001.  Numerous appeals are currently pending at the administrative level. In the event the Company is ultimately unsuccessful, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel and other advisors, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail on appeal, if necessary, in the Brazilian federal courts. 
    
  In July 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda. (the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller) and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, in the 6th. Lower Federal Court in the City of S o Paulo, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of Kolynos. The action seeks to make the Company s Brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary. The case has been pending since 2002, and the Lower Federal Court has not issued a decision.  Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the Company should ultimately prevail in this action. The Company intends to challenge this action vigorously. 
    
  In December 2005, the Brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the Company s Brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately $  66   million, at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company has been disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority s administrative appeals process. In November 2014, the Superior Chamber of Administrative Tax Appeals denied the Company s most recent appeal. Further appeals are available both at the administrative level and within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail on appeal, if not at the administrative level, in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously.

Competition Matters 
    
  European Competition Matters 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries in Europe are subject to investigations, and in some cases, fines by governmental authorities in a number of European countries related to potential competition law violations. The Company understands that substantially all of these matters also involve other consumer goods companies and/or retail customers. The status of the various pending matters is discussed below. 
    
  Fines have been imposed on the Company in the following matters, although, as noted below, the Company has appealed each of these fines: 

In December 2009, the Swiss competition law authority imposed a fine of $  6   million on the Company s GABA subsidiary for alleged violations of restrictions on parallel imports into Switzerland, which the Company appealed. In January 2014, this appeal was denied. The Company is appealing before the Swiss Supreme Court. 
                
    In January 2010, the Company     s Spanish subsidiary was fined $  3   million by the Spanish competition law authority on the basis that it had entered an agreement with other shower gel manufacturers regarding product downsizing, which the Company contested. The fine was annulled by the Court of Appeal in July 2013. The Spanish competition law authority is appealing this judgment before the Spanish Supreme Court. 
                
    In December 2010, the Italian competition law authority found that 16 consumer goods companies, including the Company s Italian subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information in the cosmetics sector, for which the Company s Italian subsidiary was fined $  3   million. The Company is appealing the fine in the Italian courts. 
                
    In March 2012, the French competition law authority found that three pet food producers, including the Company s Hill s French subsidiary, had violated competition law, for which it imposed a fine of $  7   million on the Company s Hill s French subsidiary for alleged restrictions on exports from France, which the Company contested. In October 2013, the Company     s appeal was denied. The Company is appealing before the French Supreme Court. 
                
    In December 2014, the French competition law authority found that 13 consumer goods companies, including the Company s French subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information related to the French home care and personal care sectors, for which the Company s French subsidiary was fined   $57   million. In addition, as a result of the Company s acquisition of the Sanex personal care business in 2011 from Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V.,  Unilever ) pursuant to a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the  Sanex Purchase Agreement ), the French competition law authority found that the Company s French subsidiary, along with another consumer goods company, are jointly and severally liable for fines of   $25   million assessed against Sara Lee s French subsidiary. The Company is seeking indemnification for the   $25   million fine from Unilever under the Sanex Purchase Agreement. The Company is appealing both fines in the French courts. 
       
  Currently, formal claims of violations or statements of objections are pending against the Company as follows: 
             
    In October 2012, the Belgian competition law authority alleged that 11 branded goods companies, including the Company s Belgian subsidiary, assisted retailers to coordinate their retail prices on the Belgian market. The defendants have initiated preliminary talks with the authority regarding a possible settlement. 
                
    In July 2014, the Greek competition law authority issued a statement of objections alleging the Company and its Greek subsidiary restricted parallel imports into Greece. The Company has responded to this statement of objections. 
       
     14 

Australian Competition Matter 
    
  In December 2013, the Australian competition law authority instituted civil proceedings in the Sydney registry of the Federal Court of Australia alleging that three consumer goods companies, including the Company s Australian subsidiary, a retailer and a former employee of the Company s Australian subsidiary violated the Australian competition law by coordinating the launching and pricing of ultra-concentrated laundry detergents. The Company is defending these proceedings. Since the amount of any potential losses from these proceedings currently cannot be estimated, the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities disclosed above does not include any amount relating to these proceedings. 
    
  The Company s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and can result in substantial fines for violations that are found. While the Company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues, as these matters may change, the Company evaluates developments in these matters quarterly and accrues liabilities as and when appropriate. 
    
  Talcum Powder Matters 
    
  The Company is a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos. Since 2008, the Company has challenged and intends to continue to challenge these cases vigorously, and although there can be no assurances, it believes, based on the advice of its legal counsel, that they are without merit and the Company should ultimately prevail. Currently, there are 13 single plaintiff cases pending against the Company in state courts in California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York and one case pending in federal court in North Carolina. 19 similar cases previously filed against the Company have been dismissed and final judgment entered in favor of the Company.  To date, there have been no findings of liability against the Company in any of these cases. Since the amount of any potential losses from these cases currently cannot be estimated, the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities disclosed above does not include any amount relating to these cases. 
    
  Some of these cases are currently expected to go to trial in 2015, although the Company may succeed in dismissing or otherwise resolving some or all of them prior to trial. As stated above, while the Company believes, based on the advice of its legal counsel, that it should ultimately prevail, there can be no assurances of the outcome at trial. 

ERISA Matters 
    
  In July 2014, the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees  Retirement Income Plan (the  Plan ) settled a putative class action alleging improper calculation of lump sum distributions and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements under the Plan. Under the settlement agreement, the Plan agreed to pay approximately $  40   million after application of certain offsets to resolve the litigation.

  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The share repurchase program approved by the Board on September 8, 2011 (the  2011 Program ) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company s common stock. The Board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 Program as of May 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Company s common stock in 2013. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company s compensation and benefit programs. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors. 
    
  The following table shows the stock repurchase activity for each of the three months in the quarter ended   December 31, 2014  :   

  _______ 
            (1)   
    Includes share repurchases under the 2011 Program and those associated with certain employee elections under the Company s compensation and benefit programs. 
               (2)   
    The difference between the total number of shares purchased and the total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is   188,779   shares, all of which relate to shares deemed surrendered to the Company to satisfy certain employee elections under the Company s compensation and benefit programs. 
               (3)   
    Includes maximum number of shares that were available to be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs that were in effect on December 31, 2014. 
       
  On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5 billion under a new share repurchase program (the  2015 Program ), which replaced the 2011 Program. The Company will commence repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock under the 2015 Program after February 19, 2015.

  Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. 
    
  To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
    
  Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company s sales and profitability. Approximately   80%   of the Company s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with over   50%   of the Company s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. 
    
  The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. 
    
  On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. 
    
  To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company s products. 
    
  The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.

   As discussed in Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors,  with approximately   80%   of its Net sales generated outside the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations, high inflation and the decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. Price controls, which became effective in April 2012, affect most products in the portfolio of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary ( CP Venezuela ) and restrict the Company s ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the Company s ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. In particular, the Company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013, and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014. In addition, the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of U.S. dollars to fund CP Venezuela s imports. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted several changes to Venezuela s foreign exchange regime, introducing a multi-tier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert Venezuelan bolivares to U.S. dollars. Although the official exchange rate, as determined by the National Center for Foreign Commerce ( CENCOEX ), remained at   6.30   bolivares per dollar, the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the SICAD I (Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency) currency market. The Venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as SICAD II. The Company remeasures the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, is the SICAD I rate.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred net pretax losses of   $327   (  $214   aftertax losses or   $0.23   per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD I rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014. The SICAD I rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at   12.00   bolivares per dollar as of   December 31, 2014  . Included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at   6.30   bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the SICAD I currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. The net remeasurement losses incurred in 2014 are referred to as the  2014 Venezuela Remeasurements.  
    
  There continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and, to a lesser degree, the import of materials at the SICAD I exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate. Because the SICAD I market is auction-based and auctions are held periodically during each quarter, the exchange rate available through SICAD I may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets and further impact CP Venezuela s ongoing results. 
    
  CP Venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of   6.30   bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by CENCOEX and the liabilities are paid.  
    
  As part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government also issued a new Law on Fair Pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%. The new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls, which includes most of the products in CP Venezuela s portfolio. During the third quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of CP Venezuela s product portfolio, which were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014.

   During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred a pretax loss of   $172   (  $111   aftertax loss or   $0.12   per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from   4.30   to   6.30   bolivares per dollar (the  2013 Venezuela Remeasurement ). The 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements and the 2013 Venezuela Remeasurement are referred to together as the  Venezuela Remeasurements.  
  CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CENCOEX and intercompany borrowings. CP Venezuela s supply of U.S. dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic. CP Venezuela was invited to participate in the SICAD I currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than $1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 10.50 bolivares per dollar and 12.00 bolivares per dollar, respectively. Although accessible to the Company, the Company did not participate in the SICAD II currency market during 2014. CP Venezuela s difficulty in accessing U.S. dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business. Additionally, at times, production at CP Venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country. 
    
  For the year ended   December 31, 2014  , CP Venezuela represented approximately   3%   of the Company s consolidated Net sales and approximately 1% of the Company s consolidated Operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and certain European competition law matters and the sale of land in Mexico (discussed below). At   December 31, 2014  , CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the SICAD I rate, was   $549  . This amount includes the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were   $310   at   December 31, 2014   and included   $235   of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if CP Venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports.  
    
  In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes in Venezuela s foreign exchange regime. While the official exchange rate, as determined by CENCOEX, remains at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the SICAD I market (now known as SICAD) is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 12.00 bolivares per dollar, the SICAD II market, discussed above, has been eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the Foreign Exchange Marginal System ( SIMADI ), has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. The SIMADI market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 170.04 bolivares per dollar. While the Company will continue to assess the impact, if any, of these changes as the government of Venezuela issues regulations to implement them, if CP Venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars from CENCOEX or the SICAD market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the SIMADI market, it could significantly impact the Company s operations in Venezuela. 
    
   The Company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to Venezuela. The Company s business in Venezuela, and the Company s ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above. Additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the Company s business in Venezuela and the Company s ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its Venezuelan operations, both of which could result in an impairment of the Company s investment in CP Venezuela.  At   December 31, 2014  , the Company s total investment in CP Venezuela was $955, which included intercompany payables of CP Venezuela.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program for sustained growth. The program s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.

   On October 23, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded, the  2012 Restructuring Program ). The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas:  
             
    Expanding Commercial Hubs  
                
    Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions 
                
    Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities  
       
  The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.  
    
  Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016. Savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. In   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , the Company incurred aftertax costs of   $208  ,   $278   and   $70  , respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see  Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  below.  
    
  On September 13, 2011, the Company s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America (the  Purchaser ) the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by March 20, 2015. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 20, 2015, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the Company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. The Company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. Exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready. 
    
  In   2014  ,   2013   and 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of   $3  ,   $12   and   $18  , respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico and, in 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. 
    
  Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company s future results. 
    
  The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company s global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.

   Operating Profit 
    
  In   2014  , Operating profit was $  3,557  , even with 2013. In   2013  , Operating profit decreased   9%   to   $3,556   from   $3,889   in   2012  .   
    
  In 2014 and 2013, Operating profit included charges related to the Venezuela Remeasurements and charges for European competition law matters. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, Operating profit included charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. In 2012, Operating profit also included costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Excluding these items in all years, as applicable, Operating profit increased   2%   in   2014  , primarily due to lower Selling, general and administrative expenses, which more than offset the decrease in Gross profit, and Operating profit increased   3%   in   2013  , primarily due to sales growth and higher Gross profit margin.  
    
  Operating profit margin was   20.6%   in   2014  , compared with   20.4%   in   2013   and   22.8%   in   2012  . Excluding the items described above in both periods as applicable, Operating profit margin increased   60   bps to   24.4%   in   2014   compared to   23.8%   in   2013  . This increase is mainly due to a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales (  60   bps).   
    
  Excluding the items described above in both periods as applicable, Operating profit margin increased   30   bps in   2013   compared to   2012  , primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (50 bps), which was partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales.

   Interest (Income) Expense, Net 
    
  Interest (income) expense, net was   $24   in   2014   compared with   $(9)   in   2013   and   $15   in   2012  . The increase in Interest (income) expense, net from   2013   to   2014   was primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 and lower interest income on investments held outside the United States. The decrease in Interest (income) expense, net from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in interest income on investments held outside of the United States, which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher debt balances.

  The effective income tax rate was   33.8%   in   2014  ,   32.4%   in   2013   and   32.1%   in   2012  .  As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was   31.5%   in   2014  ,   31.7%   in   2013   and   31.8%   in   2012  . 

The charge for a foreign tax matter relates to a notice of an adverse decision in a foreign court regarding a tax position taken in prior years received by the Company in the second quarter of 2014. Although it plans to appeal this decision, the Company, as required, reassessed its tax position in light of the decision and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by   $30   and write off a   $36   deferred tax asset. The Company recorded this   $66   income tax charge in the third quarter of 2014.   
    
  The effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company s global business initiatives.

   Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  
    
  2012 Restructuring Program  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced the 2012 Restructuring Program. The program s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 
    
  The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include: 
             
    Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company     s operations around the world.  
                
    Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.  
                
    Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company     s gross and operating profit. 
                
    Building on Colgate     s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth. 
       
  On October 23, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program. The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas:  
             
    Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure. 
                
    Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company     s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions.  
                
    Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.  
       
  The Board authorized the expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.  
    
  Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016. These pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (  50%  ); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (  10%  ); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (  20%  ) and the implementation of new strategies (  20%  ). Anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately   $330   to   $385   (  $245   to   $285   aftertax). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately   75%   of the charges will result in cash expenditures.

   It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (  15%  ), Europe/South Pacific (  20%  ), Latin America (  5%  ), Asia (  5%  ), Africa/Eurasia (  5%  ), Hill s Pet Nutrition (  10%  ) and Corporate (  40%  ), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately 2,000-2,500 positions from the Company s global employee workforce.  
    
  Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately   $80   to   $100   pretax (  $60   to   $75   aftertax). 
    
  For the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:   

Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

   Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred pretax cumulative charges of   $746   (  $556   aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows:  

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the simplification and streamlining of the Company     s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of  its U.S.-based employees participating in the Company     s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company     s defined contribution plan; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; and the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility.

   Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to   $5  ,   $17   and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see   Note 10  , Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  
    
  Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.  Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets. 
    
  Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of   $65  ,   $50   and   $8  , respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of   $40  ,   $34   and   $3  , respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program.

Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of   $91   related to changes to the Company     s U.S. defined benefit retirement plans (see   Note 10  , Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
    
    Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  This Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   2013   is provided below. 
    
  Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges related to the Venezuela Remeasurements, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, charges for European competition law matters, a charge for a foreign tax matter and costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013  , and 2012 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 
    
  The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets. 
    
  Cash Flow 
    
  Net cash provided by operations was   $3,298   in   2014  , compared to   $3,204   in   2013   and   $3,196   in   2012  . Net cash provided by operations for   2014   increased due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital. The increase in   2013   as compared to   2012   was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital, partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 Restructuring Program.  
    
  The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company s working capital as a percentage of Net sales was   0.8%   and   0.7%   in   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
    
   Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, estimated to be   $1,285   to   $1,435   pretax (  $950   to   $1,050   aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately   $330   to   $385   (  $245   to   $285   aftertax) and savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2014 is expected to be paid before year end 2015. 
    
  Investing activities used   $859   of cash in   2014  , compared to   $890   and   $865   during   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in   2014   to   $340   from   $505   in   2013   partially due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the Company     s subsidiary in Venezuela of local currency-denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. In 2012, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Tom     s of Maine for $18. In 2011, the Company     s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by March 20, 2015. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 20, 2015, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the Company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. Capital expenditures were   $757  ,   $670   and   $565   for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program.  
    
  Financing activities used   $2,170   of cash during   2014   compared to   $2,142   and   $2,301   during   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The increase in cash used in   2014   as compared to   2013   was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. The decrease in cash used in   2013   as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options.

    Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to   $6,132   as of   December 31, 2014  , as compared to   $5,644   as of   December 31, 2013   and total debt increased to   $6,148   as of   December 31, 2014   as compared to   $5,657   as of   December 31, 2013  . The Company s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% and during the second quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.30%. The debt issuances in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were U.S. dollar denominated and were under the Company     s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of U.S. dollar denominated notes and  250 of euro denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2012 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings.  
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of   $3,001   (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $  1,850   with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to   November 2019   and the capacity of the facility was increased to   $2,370  . The Company also has the ability to draw   $165   from a revolving credit facility that expires in   November 2015  . In addition, the Company has the ability to draw   $20   from a new credit facility entered into during 2014, which expires in   December 2015  . Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material. 
    
  Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was   $255   and   $0   as of    December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in   2014   and   2013   were $1,486 and $1,736, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in   November 2019  . 
    
  The following is a summary of the Company s commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  : 

Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See   Note 6  , Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company s long-term debt and credit facilities. 
    
  Dividend payments in   2014   were   $1,446  , an increase from   $1,382   in   2013   and   $1,277   in   2012  . Dividend payments increased to $  1.42   per share in   2014   from   $1.33   per share in   2013   and $1.22 per share in   2012  . In the first quarter of 2014, the Company s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.36 per share from $0.34 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2014.  
     40 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 

   The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on September 8, 2011 (the  2011 Program ) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company s common stock. The Board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 Program as of May 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the Company     s common stock in 2013. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company s compensation and benefit programs. 
    
  On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a new share repurchase program (the  2015 Program ), which replaced the 2011 Program. The Company will commence repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock under the 2015 Program after February 19, 2015. 
    
  Aggregate share repurchases in   2014   consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $  1,530  . Aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. Aggregate repurchases in 2012 consisted of 37.6 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents increased   $127   during   2014   to   $1,089   at   December 31, 2014  , compared to   $962   at   December 31, 2013  , most of which ($1,034 and $865, respectively) were held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries. These amounts include $64 and $114     at     December 31, 2014     and     2013  , respectively,     which are subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014  , the Company had approximately $  4,900   of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes.  Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. As the Company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.  
    
  The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Company s contractual obligations as of   December 31, 2014  : 

_______ 
            (1)   
    Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. 
               (2)   
    The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of   2014   for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.

   Long-term liabilities associated with the Company s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2015. Management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2015. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2015 from the Company s assets is estimated to be approximately   $69  . 
    
  Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. See   Note 11  , Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
    
  As more fully described in Part I, Item 3      Legal Proceedings      and   Note 13  , Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 
    
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 
    
  Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk Exposure 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company s treasury and risk management policies. The Company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. 
    
  The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and  Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the  Results of Operations  section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each operating segment. 
    
  The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders  equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. 
    
  For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), local currency-denominated non-monetary assets including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.

   The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates. 
    
  The Company s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $22 and $5 at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of   2014  , an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $29. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. 
    
  Based on year-end   2014   variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased Interest (income) expense, net by $10 in   2014  . 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as   resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans  . The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill     s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities. 
    
  The Company s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and $0 at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , respectively. At the end of   2014  , an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.  
    
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. The standard allows for either  full retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     43 

(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 

    On April 10, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.  ASU No. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2015. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
       
  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
    
  In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. 

Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from   58.5%   to 50.8% in   2014   and decreased by 750 bps and 740 bps in   2013   and   2012  , respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. 

The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (     FIFO     ) method (  80%   of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (     LIFO     ) method (  20%   of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for   2014  ,   2013   or   2012   had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 
       
  The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. 

In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was   4.24%  , 4.96% and 4.14% as of December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was   4.36%  , 5.24% and 4.32% as of December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was   6.80%   as of December 31,   2014  ,   6.80%   as of December 31,   2013   and 7.30% as of December 31,   2012  . As the funded status of the U.S. postretirement plans improved in 2013, the Company reallocated a portion of the assets of those plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans  investments and the historical rate of return. 
       
     44

   Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were   11%  ,   10%  ,   7%  ,   5%  , and   8%  , respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans  investments with a target asset allocation of approximately   53  % in fixed income securities,   27%   in equity securities and   20  % in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $11. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $4. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was   3.50%   as of   December 31, 2014  , December 31,   2013   and December 31,   2012  . Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s pension and other postretirement plans. 

The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is   7.0%   for   2015  , declining to   5.0%   by   2021   and remaining at   5.0%   for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $7. 

The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (     Black-Scholes     ) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended   December 31, 2014   was $  7.60  . The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%. 

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management s strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. 
       
  The estimated fair value of the Company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the Sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management s best estimate of net realizable values. Asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the Company s subsidiary in Venezuela requires management s best estimate of future exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivares, the rate of inflation in Venezuela, the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in Venezuela, whether the Company has sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports.

The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution. 

Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. 

Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s contingencies. 
       
  The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company s significant accounting policies. 
    
  Market Share Information  
    
  Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of  the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data.  
  Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.

   Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of currency devaluations and exchange controls, price or profit controls and labor unrest, including in Venezuela, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 Restructuring Program, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels or legal proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors.

  The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   December 31, 2014   (the      Evaluation     ). Based upon the Evaluation, the Company s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective. 
    
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  and concluded that it is effective as of   December 31, 2014  .  
    
  The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2014  , and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report, which appears in this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As part of the 2012 Restructuring Program, the Company has begun implementing a shared business service organization model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. This implementation is expected to continue in a phased approach in future years. At this time, certain financial transaction processing activities have been transitioned to these newly established shared business services centers. The Company does not expect this transition to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
  Colgate-Palmolive Company 
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its subsidiaries (the  Company ) at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). The Company     s management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management     s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company     s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  A company     s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company     s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company     s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

1.    Nature of Operations       
    
  The Company manufactures and markets a wide variety of products in the U.S. and around the world in   two   product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Oral, Personal and Home Care products include toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash, bar and liquid hand soaps, shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants and antiperspirants, laundry and dishwashing detergents, fabric conditioners, household cleaners, bleaches and other similar items. These products are sold primarily to retail trade customers and wholesale distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products include specialty pet nutrition products manufactured and marketed by Hill s Pet Nutrition. The principal customers for Pet Nutrition products are authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, elmex, Tom s of Maine, Sanex, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill s Science Diet, Hill s Prescription Diet and Hill     s Ideal Balance. 
    
  The Company s principal classes of products accounted for the following percentages of worldwide Net sales for the past three years: 

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company s investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between   20%   and   50%  , where the Company has significant influence over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , equity method investments included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were   $31   and   $27  , respectively. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interests in these investments. Investments with less than a   20%   interest are accounted for using the cost method. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Company s assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and retirement plan assets. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.

     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   Revenue Recognition 
    
  Sales are recorded at the time products are shipped to trade customers and when risk of ownership transfers. Net sales reflect units shipped at selling list prices reduced by sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the period incurred. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements with trade customers. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience and is recorded when coupons are distributed. Volume-based incentives offered to trade customers are based on the estimated cost of the program and are recorded as products are sold. 
    
  Shipping and Handling Costs 
    
  Shipping and handling costs are classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses and were   $1,326  ,   $1,304   and   $1,262   for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Marketing Costs 
    
  The Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of approximately   80%   of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (     FIFO     ) method. The cost of all other inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the last-in, first-out (     LIFO     ) method. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Land, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives ranging from   3   to   15   years for machinery and equipment and up to   40   years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
    
  Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company s global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. These tests were performed and did not result in an impairment charge. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from   5   to   40   years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.

  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Provision is made currently for taxes payable on remittances of overseas earnings; no provision is made for taxes on overseas retained earnings that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. 
    
  The Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return.  The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  Derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information. The Company s derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. For hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  Cash flows related to hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  The Company may also enter into certain foreign currency and interest rate instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments, based on quoted market prices, are recognized in earnings each period. The Company s derivative instruments and other financial instruments are more fully described in   Note 7  , Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments along with the related fair value measurement considerations. 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period.  The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (     Black-Scholes     ) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards.  Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in   Note 8  , Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans. 
    
  Currency Translation 
    
  The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders  equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. 
    
  For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), local currency-denominated non-monetary assets, including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. The standard allows for either  full retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On April 10, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.  ASU No. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2015. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   Additionally, Other current assets in the December 31, 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet were adjusted to include certain non-income tax receivables which were previously included in Other accruals. 
    
    3.    Acquisitions and Divestitures 
    
  Acquisition 
    
  On October 3, 2014, the Company acquired an oral care business in Myanmar for   $62   in cash plus additional consideration contingent upon achievement of performance targets under a distribution services agreement.  
    
  Sale of Land in Mexico 
    
  On September 13, 2011, the Company s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America (the  Purchaser )  the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. The sale price is payable in three installments. During the third quarter of 2011, the Company received the first installment of   $24   upon signing the agreement. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company received the second installment of   $36  . The final installment is due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the Company s satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by March 20, 2015. While these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by March 20, 2015, in which case the Purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the Company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. The Company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. Exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready. In   2014  ,   2013   and 2012 the Company recorded   $4  ,   $18   and   $24   of pretax costs (  $3  ,   $12   and   $18   of aftertax costs), respectively, related to the sale.

   4.        Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a   four  -year Global Growth and Efficiency Program for sustained growth. The program s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 
    
  On   October 23, 2014  , the Company s Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded the  2012 Restructuring Program ) to take advantage of additional savings opportunities.  
    
  Cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be   $1,285   to   $1,435   (  $950   to   $1,050   aftertax). Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016. These pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (  50%  ); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (  10%  ); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (  20%  ) and the implementation of new strategies (  20%  ). Anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately   $330   to   $385   (  $245   to   $285   aftertax). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately   75%   of the charges will result in cash expenditures.  
    
  It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (  15%  ), Europe/South Pacific (  20%  ), Latin America (  5%  ), Asia (  5%  ), Africa/Eurasia (  5%  ), Hill s Pet Nutrition (  10%  ) and Corporate (  40%  ), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately   2,000  -  2,500   positions from the Company s global employee workforce.  
    
  For the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:   

Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.   
     64 

      COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   Total charges incurred for the 2012 Restructuring Program relate to initiatives undertaken by the following reportable operating segments: 

Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred pretax cumulative charges of   $746   (  $556   aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows:  

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the simplification and streamlining of the Company     s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of  its U.S.-based employees participating in the Company     s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company     s defined contribution plan; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; and the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility. 
    
     65 

      COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accruals: 

Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to   $5  ,   $17   and   $0   for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see   Note 10  , Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits).  
    
  Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets. 
    
  Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of   $65  ,   $50   and   $8  , respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of   $40  ,   $34   and   $3  , respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of   $82   and   $25  , respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. Other charges for the year ended December 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of   $91   related to changes to the Company     s U.S. defined benefit retirement plans (see   Note 10  , Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits).

   5.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  The net carrying value of Goodwill as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , by segment is as follows: 

The change in the amount of Goodwill in each year is primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.  
    
  Other intangible assets as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013   are comprised of the following: 

The changes in the net carrying amounts of Other intangible assets during   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   were primarily due to amortization expense of   $32  ,   $32   and   $31  , respectively, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. Annual estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be approximately   $30  .

   6.            Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities 
    
  Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31: 

The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings of   $16   in   2014   and   $13   in   2013   included in Notes and loans payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013   was   1.9%    and   2.2%  , respectively. 
    
  The Company classifies commercial paper as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. Excluding commercial paper reclassified as long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt and capitalized leases outstanding as of   December 31, 2014  , are as follows:   

The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts related to certain of these debt instruments. See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments for further information about the Company s financial instruments. 
  During the   fourth quarter of 2014  , the Company issued   $134   of   forty  -year notes at a   variable rate  . During the   first quarter of 2014  , the Company issued   $500   of   five  -year notes at a fixed rate of   1.75%   and   $500   of   ten  -year notes at a fixed-rate of   3.25%  . During the   fourth quarter of 2013  , the Company issued   $300   of   five  -year notes at a fixed rate of   1.50%   and    $82   of   forty  -year notes at a   variable rate  . During the   second quarter of 2013  , the Company issued   $400   of   five  -year notes at a fixed rate of   0.90%   and   $400   of   ten  -year notes at a fixed rate of   2.10%  .  
    
  The debt issuances in 2014 and 2013 were U.S. dollar denominated and were under the Company s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarter of 2014 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the first quarter of   2014   were also used to repay and retire   $250   of U.S. dollar denominated notes and    250   of euro denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. In addition, proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were used to repay and retire   $250   of notes due in 2013. 
    
     68 

      COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   At   December 31, 2014  , the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of   $3,001   (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a   five  -year revolving credit facility with a capacity of   $1,850   with a syndicate of banks. This facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to   November 2019   and the capacity of the facility was increased to   $2,370  . The Company also has the ability to draw   $165   from a revolving credit facility that expires in   November 2015  . In addition, the Company has the ability to draw   $20   from a new credit facility entered into during 2014, which expires in   December 2015  . Commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material. 
    
  Certain agreements with respect to the Company s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 
    
    7.    Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company s treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company s policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is not material for any period presented. Provided below are details of the Company s exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation. 
    
  Valuation Considerations 
    
  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified as follows: 
    
  Level 1: Based upon quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2: Based upon observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Based upon unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity s own assumptions. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  As the Company markets its products in over   200   countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.    
    
  The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation). 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation). 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as   resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans  . The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of  
     69 

    COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts.  Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Hill s Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities, and these contracts are measured using quoted commodity exchange prices (Level 1 valuation).  The duration of the commodity contracts generally does not exceed 12 months. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.  
    
  The following summarizes the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments and other financial instruments at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  : 

The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, a note receivable and short-term debt approximated fair value as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt, including the current portion, as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , was   $6,346   and   $5,690  , respectively, and the related carrying value was   $6,132   and   $5,644  , respectively. The estimated fair value of long-term debt was derived principally from quoted prices on the Company s outstanding fixed-term notes (Level 2 valuation).

    COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   Fair Value Hedges 
    
  The Company has designated all interest rate swap contracts and certain foreign currency forward and option contracts as fair value hedges, for which the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in current earnings. The impact of foreign currency contracts is primarily recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of interest rate swap contracts is recognized in Interest (income) expense, net.   
    
  Activity related to fair value hedges recorded during each period presented was as follows:    

Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  All of the Company s commodity contracts and certain foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges, for which the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (     OCI     ) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  
    
  Activity related to cash flow hedges recorded during each period presented was as follows: 

The net gain (loss) recognized in OCI for both foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts is expected to be recognized in Cost of sales within the next twelve months. 
    
  Net Investment Hedges 
    
  The Company has designated certain foreign currency forward and option contracts and certain foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges, for which the gain or loss on the instrument is reported as a component of Currency translation adjustments within OCI, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items.  
    
     71 

    COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

   Activity related to net investment hedges recorded during each period presented was as follows: 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for each period consist of a cross-currency swap that serves as an economic hedge of a foreign currency deposit, for which the gain or loss on the instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in Other (income) expense, net for each period.  
    
  Activity related to these contracts during each period presented was as follows: 

Other Financial Instruments 
    
  Other financial instruments are classified as Other current assets or Other assets. 
    
  Other financial instruments classified as Other current assets include marketable securities and a fixed interest rate note receivable. Marketable securities consist of bank deposits of   $123   with original maturities greater than 90 days (Level 1 valuation) and the current portion of bonds issued by the Venezuelan government (Level 2 valuation) in the amount of   $77  . The long-term portion of these bonds in the amount of   $322   is included in Other assets. 
    
  Through its subsidiary in Venezuela, the Company is invested in U.S. dollar-linked devaluation-protected bonds and bolivar denominated fixed interest rate bonds, both of which are issued by the Venezuelan government. These bonds are actively traded and, therefore, are considered Level 2 investments as their values are determined based upon observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. As of   December 31, 2014  , the fair market value of  U.S. dollar-linked devaluation-protected bonds and bolivar denominated fixed interest rate bonds was   $114   and   $285  , respectively. These bonds are considered available-for-sale securities and, as noted above, the long-term portion in the amount of   $322   is included in Other assets.

   The following table presents a reconciliation of the Venezuelan bonds at fair value for the twelve months ended December 31: 

Unrealized loss on investment for the year ended   December 31, 2014   included a net loss of   $324   primarily related to the remeasurement of the bolivar denominated fixed interest rate bonds and the devaluation-protected bonds in Venezuela as a result of the effective devaluations in the first and third quarters of 2014.  
    
  Unrealized loss on investment for the year ended   December 31, 2013   consisted primarily of a charge of   $133   related only to the remeasurement of the bolivar denominated fixed interest rate bonds in Venezuela as a result of the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013. No remeasurement charge was required on the devaluation-protected bonds in the first quarter of 2013 since the official exchange rate changed from   4.30   to   6.30   bolivares per dollar and the devaluation-protected bonds revalued to the official exchange rate. For further information regarding Venezuela, refer to   Note 14  , Venezuela.

  Preference Stock 
    
  The Company has the authority to issue   50,262,150   shares of preference stock.  
    
  Stock Repurchases 
    
  The Company repurchased its common stock at a cost of $  1,530   during   2014   under a share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors and publicly announced in September 2011 (the      2011 Program     ). The 2011 Program authorized the Company to repurchase up to   50 million   shares of its common stock. The Board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 Program as of May 15, 2013 be increased by   100%   as a result of the   two  -for-one stock split of the Company s common stock in 2013. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company s compensation and benefit programs. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.   
    
  On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to   $5,000   under a new share repurchase program (the  2015 Program ), which replaced the 2011 Program. The Company will commence repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock under the 2015 Program after February 19, 2015. 
    
  The Company may use either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock unit awards. 
    
  A summary of common stock and treasury stock activity for the three years ended December 31, is as follows:

   Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The value of restricted stock units, based on market prices, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation cost from the grant date through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. 
    
  The Company has one incentive compensation plan, which was approved by the Company     s stockholders on May 10, 2013, pursuant to which it issues restricted stock units and stock options to employees and shares of common stock and stock options to non-employee directors. The Personnel and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, administers the incentive compensation plan. Previously, the Company issued these awards pursuant to four different stockholder-approved plans. The total stock-based compensation expense charged against pretax income for these plans was $  131  , $  128   and $  120   for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized on stock-based compensation was approximately $  42  ,   $39   and   $37   for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense is recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Corporate segment as these amounts are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. 
    
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted in the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was $  7.60  , $  7.41   and $  6.73  , respectively. Fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions summarized in the following table: 

The weighted-average expected term of options granted each year was determined with reference to historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation experience, the vesting period of the awards and contractual term of the awards, among other factors. Expected volatility incorporates implied share-price volatility derived from exchange traded options on the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity period equal to the option s expected term.

   Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The Company grants restricted stock unit awards to officers and other employees. Awards vest at the end of the restriction period, which is generally three years.  As of   December 31, 2014  , approximately   12,414,000   shares of common stock were available for future restricted stock unit awards. 
    
  A summary of restricted stock unit activity during   2014   is presented below: 

As of   December 31, 2014  , there was $  63   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.1   years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was $  71  , $  69   and $  63  , respectively. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The Company issues non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors, officers and other employees. Stock options generally have a contractual term of   six   years and vest over   three   years. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   46,062,000   shares of common stock were available for future stock option grants.  
    
  A summary of stock option activity during   2014   is presented below: 

As of   December 31, 2014  , there was $  46   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to options, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.5   years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was $  211  , $  180   and $  210  , respectively. 
    
  The benefits of tax deductions in excess of grant date fair value resulting from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock unit awards for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was $  63  , $  51   and $  60  , respectively, and was reported as a financing cash flow. Cash proceeds received from options exercised for the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   were $  314  , $  289   and $  409  , respectively.

   9.    Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
    
  In 1989, the Company expanded its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (     ESOP     ) through the introduction of a leveraged ESOP that funds certain benefits for employees who have met eligibility requirements. The ESOP issued   $410   of long-term notes due through July 2009 bearing an average interest rate of   8.7%  . The notes, which were guaranteed by the Company, were repaid in July 2009. The ESOP used the proceeds from the notes issuance to purchase   6,315,149   shares of Series B Convertible Preference stock (the      Series B Preference stock     ) from the Company. As a result of rules issued by the Internal Revenue Service (     IRS     ) related to employer stock held in defined contribution plans, the Company issued a notice of redemption with respect to the remaining shares of Series B Preference stock outstanding on   December 29, 2010  . At the direction of the Company s ESOP trustee, these shares of Series B Preference stock were converted into   38,483,072   shares of common stock, adjusted for the two-for-one stock split of the Company s common stock in 2013. As of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , there were   26,137,798   and   29,119,135   shares of common stock, respectively, outstanding and issued to the Company     s ESOP. The common stock for the conversion was issued from treasury shares.   
    
  During 2000, the ESOP entered into a loan agreement with the Company under which the benefits of the ESOP may be extended through 2035. As of   December 31, 2014  , the ESOP had outstanding borrowings from the Company of   $20  , which represents unearned compensation shown as a reduction in Shareholders  equity. 
    
  Dividends on stock held by the ESOP are paid to the ESOP trust and, together with cash contributions from the Company, are (a) used by the ESOP to repay principal and interest, (b) credited to participant accounts, or (c) used for contributions to the Company s defined contribution plans. Stock is allocated to participants based upon the ratio of the current year s debt service to the sum of total outstanding principal and interest payments over the life of the debt. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   18,489,250   shares of common stock were released and allocated to participant accounts and   7,648,548   shares of common stock were available for future allocation to participant accounts.  
    
  Dividends on the stock used to repay principal and interest or credited to participant accounts are deductible for income tax purposes and, accordingly, are reflected net of their tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders  Equity. 
    
  Annual expense related to the ESOP was   $2  ,   $0  , and   $0   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
    
   The Company paid dividends on the shares held by the ESOP of   $40   in   2014  ,   $41   in   2013   and   $40   in   2012  . The Company contributed   $2   to the ESOP in   2014  . The Company did not make any contributions to the ESOP in   2013   or   2012  .

   10.     Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits 
    
  Retirement Plans 
    
  The Company and certain of its U.S. and overseas subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans. Benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees  career earnings. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Company changed the way it provides retirement benefits to substantially all of its U.S.-based employees participating in its defined benefit retirement plan. For these employees, the Company now provides all future retirement benefits through the Company s defined contribution plan. As a result, no future service is considered for these employees for future accruals in the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans. Participants in the Company s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan whose retirement benefit was determined under the cash balance formula continue to earn interest on their vested balances as of December 31, 2013. Participants whose retirement benefit was determined under the final average earnings formula continue to have their final average earnings adjusted for pay increases until termination of employment. These changes resulted in a curtailment charge of   $91   as all of the previously unamortized prior service costs recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was recognized in 2013.  
    
  In the Company s principal U.S. plans and certain funded overseas plans, funds are contributed to trusts in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation over a reasonable period. The target asset allocation for the Company s defined benefit plans are as follows:

    At   December 31, 2013   the allocation of the Company s plan assets and the level of valuation input for each major asset category was as follows: 

_______ 
            (a)   
    The fixed income securities are traded over the counter and certain of these securities lack daily pricing or liquidity and as such are classified as Level 2. As of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , approximately   50%   of the fixed income portfolio was invested in U.S. treasury or agency securities, with the remainder invested in other government bonds and corporate bonds. 
               (b)   
    Interests in common/collective trust funds are valued using the net asset value ( NAV ) per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments owned by each trust, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
               (c)   
    The guaranteed investment contracts ( GICs ) represent contracts with insurance companies measured at the cash surrender value of each contract. The Level 2 valuation reflects that the cash surrender value is based principally on a referenced pool of investment funds with active redemption. 
               (d)   
    Real estate is valued using the NAV per unit of funds that are invested in real estate property. The investment value of the real estate property is determined quarterly using independent market appraisals as determined by the investment manager. Since the appraisals include unobservable inputs, these investments are classified as Level 3. These unobservable inputs may include items such as annual gross rents, projected vacancy rates, collection losses and recovery rates, yield rates, growth assumptions and risk adjusted discount rates.

   The following table presents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets measured at fair value for the year ended December 31: 

Equity securities in the U.S. plans include investments in the Company s common stock representing   7%   of U.S. plan assets at   December 31, 2014   and   6%   of U.S. plan assets at   December 31, 2013  . No shares of the Company s common stock were purchased or sold by the U.S. plans in   2014  . In   2013  , the U.S. plans sold   1,540,215   shares of the Company s common stock to the Company. The plans received dividends on the Company s common stock of   $2   in   2014   and   $3   in   2013  . 
    
  Other Retiree Benefits 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees to the extent not provided by government-sponsored plans.

  The overall investment objective of the plans is to balance risk and return so that obligations to employees are met. The Company evaluates its long-term rate of return on plan assets on an annual basis. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans  investments and the historical rates of return. The assumed rate of return as of   December 31, 2014   for the U.S. plans was   6.80%  . Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were   11%  ,   10%  ,   7%  ,   5%  , and   8%  , respectively.  Similar assessments were performed in determining rates of return on international pension plan assets to arrive at the Company s   2014   weighted-average rate of return of   5.05%  . 
    
  The medical cost trend rate of increase assumed in measuring the expected cost of benefits is projected to decrease from   7.0%   in   2015   to   5.0%   by   2021  , remaining at   5.0%   for the years thereafter. Changes in the assumed rate can have a significant effect on amounts reported. A 1% change in the assumed medical cost trend rate would have the following approximate effect:

Expected mortality is a key assumption in the measurement for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. For the Company s U.S. plans, this assumption was updated as of   December 31, 2014   in order to reflect the Society of Actuaries  Retirement Plan Experience Committee s updated mortality tables and mortality improvement scale published in October 2014. This resulted in an increase of   6%   and   9%   to the benefit obligations for the Company s U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefits, respectively. 
    
  Plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 consist of the following:

Applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately   $4,900   of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at   December 31, 2014  . These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and currently are not subject to such taxes. As the Company operates in over   200   countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.  
    
  In addition, net tax expense of   $251   in   2014  , net tax expense of   $116   in   2013  , and net tax benefits of   $80   in   2012   recorded directly through equity predominantly include current and future tax impacts related to employee equity compensation and benefit plans. 
    
  The Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return. 
    
  Unrecognized tax benefits activity for the years ended December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   is summarized below: 

If all of the unrecognized tax benefits for   2014   above were recognized, approximately   $195   would impact the effective tax rate. Although it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefits with respect to our uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease in the next 12 months, the Company does not expect material changes. 
    
  The Company recognized approximately   $4  ,   $5   and   $5   of interest expense related to the above unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The Company had accrued interest of approximately   $24  ,   $24   and   $19   as of December 31,   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in many state and foreign jurisdictions. All U.S. federal income tax returns through December 31, 2009 have been audited by, and settled with, the IRS. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations for income tax returns through December 31, 2009. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from   three   to   six   years.

   12.    Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.  
    
  Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and restricted stock units. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , the average number of stock options that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per share calculations were   1,729,511  ,   1,785,032   and   3,504,608  , respectively. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , the average number of restricted stock units that were anti-dilutive and not included in diluted earnings per share calculations were   2,311  ,   3,709  , and   2,252  , respectively. 
    
    13.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office and warehouse facilities, are    $201   in 2015,   $170   in 2016,   $148   in 2017,   $138   in 2018,   $126   in 2019 and   $280   thereafter. Rental expense amounted to   $234   in   2014  ,   $232   in   2013   and   $228   in   2012  . Capital leases included in fixed assets, contingent rentals and sublease income are not significant. The Company has various contractual commitments to purchase raw, packaging and other materials totaling approximately   $774   at   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  As a global company serving consumers in more than   200   countries and territories, the Company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings. These include disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Management proactively reviews and monitors the Company s exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is party to various environmental matters and, as such, may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites.

   The Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. 
    
  The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates. For those matters disclosed below, the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is $  0   to approximately $  200   (based on current exchange rates). The estimates included in this amount are based on the Company s analysis of currently available information and, as new information is obtained, these estimates may change. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the matters in question. Thus, the Company s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above. 
    
  Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year. 
    
  Brazilian Matters 
    
  There are certain tax and civil proceedings outstanding, as described below, related to the Company     s 1995 acquisition of the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (the      Seller     ). 
    
  The Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, at the current exchange rate, are approximately   $107  . The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authority s appellate process since October 2001. Numerous appeals are currently pending at the administrative level. In the event the Company is ultimately unsuccessful, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel and other advisors, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail on appeal, if necessary, in the Brazilian federal courts. 
    
  In July 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda. (the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller) and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, in the 6th. Lower Federal Court in the City of S o Paulo, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of Kolynos. The action seeks to make the Company s Brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary. The case has been pending since 2002, and the Lower Federal Court has not issued a decision. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the Company should ultimately prevail in this action. The Company intends to challenge this action vigorously.

    In December 2005, the Brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the Company s Brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately $  66  , at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company has been disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority s administrative appeals process. In November 2014, the Superior Chamber of Administrative Tax Appeals denied the Company s most recent appeal. Further appeals are available both at the administrative level and within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail on appeal, if not at the administrative level, in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously. 
    
  Competition Matters 
    
  European Competition Matters 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries in Europe are subject to investigations, and in some cases, fines by governmental authorities in a number of European countries related to potential competition law violations. The Company understands that substantially all of these matters also involve other consumer goods companies and/or retail customers. The status of the various pending matters is discussed below. 
    
  Fines have been imposed on the Company in the following matters, although, as noted below, the Company has appealed each of these fines: 
             
    In December 2009, the Swiss competition law authority imposed a fine of $  6   on the Company s GABA subsidiary for alleged violations of restrictions on parallel imports into Switzerland, which the Company appealed.  In January 2014, this appeal was denied. The Company is appealing before the Swiss Supreme Court. 
                
    In January 2010, the Company s Spanish subsidiary was fined $  3   by the Spanish competition law authority on the basis that it had entered an agreement with other shower gel manufacturers regarding product downsizing, which the Company contested. The fine was annulled by the Court of Appeal in July 2013. The Spanish competition law authority is appealing this judgment before the Spanish Supreme Court. 
                
    In December 2010, the Italian competition law authority found that 16 consumer goods companies, including the Company s Italian subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information in the cosmetics sector, for which the Company s Italian subsidiary was fined $  3  . The Company is appealing the fine in the Italian courts. 
                
    In March 2012, the French competition law authority found that three pet food producers, including the Company s Hill s French subsidiary, had violated competition law, for which it imposed a fine of $  7   on the Company s Hill s French subsidiary for alleged restrictions on exports from France, which the Company contested. In October 2013, the Company     s appeal was denied. The Company is appealing before the French Supreme Court. 
                
    In December 2014, the French competition law authority found that 13 consumer goods companies, including the Company s French subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information related to the French home care and personal care sectors, for which the Company s French subsidiary was fined   $57  . In addition, as a result of the Company s acquisition of the Sanex personal care business in 2011 from Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V.,  Unilever ) pursuant to a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the  Sanex Purchase Agreement ), the French competition law authority found that the Company s French subsidiary, along with another consumer goods company, are jointly and severally liable for fines of   $25   assessed against Sara Lee s French subsidiary. The Company is seeking indemnification for the   $25   fine from Unilever under the Sanex Purchase Agreement. The Company is appealing both fines in the French courts.

   Currently, formal claims of violations or statements of objections are pending against the Company as follows: 
             
    In October 2012, the Belgian competition law authority alleged that 11 branded goods companies, including the Company s Belgian subsidiary, assisted retailers to coordinate their retail prices on the Belgian market. The defendants have initiated preliminary talks with the authority regarding a possible settlement. 
                
    In July 2014, the Greek competition law authority issued a statement of objections alleging the Company and its Greek subsidiary restricted parallel imports into Greece. The Company has responded to this statement of objections. 
       
  Australian Competition Matter 
    
  In December 2013, the Australian competition law authority instituted civil proceedings in the Sydney registry of the Federal Court of Australia alleging that three consumer goods companies, including the Company s Australian subsidiary, a retailer and a former employee of the Company s Australian subsidiary violated the Australian competition law by coordinating the launching and pricing of ultra-concentrated laundry detergents. The Company is defending these proceedings.  Since the amount of any potential losses from these proceedings currently cannot be estimated, the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities disclosed above does not include any amount relating to these proceedings. 
    
  The Company s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry.  Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and can result in substantial fines for violations that are found. While the Company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues, as these matters may change, the Company evaluates developments in these matters quarterly and accrues liabilities as and when appropriate. 
    
  Talcum Powder Matters 
    
  The Company is a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos. Since 2008, the Company has challenged and intends to continue to challenge these cases vigorously, and although there can be no assurances, it believes, based on the advice of its legal counsel, that they are without merit and the Company should ultimately prevail. Currently, there are 13 single plaintiff cases pending against the Company in state courts in California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York and one case pending in federal court in North Carolina. 19 similar cases previously filed against the Company have been dismissed and final judgment entered in favor of the Company. To date, there have been no findings of liability against the Company in any of these cases. Since the amount of any potential losses from these cases currently cannot be estimated, the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities disclosed above does not include any amount relating to these cases. 
    
  Some of these cases are currently expected to go to trial in 2015, although the Company may succeed in dismissing or otherwise resolving some or all of them prior to trial. As stated above, while the Company believes, based on the advice of its legal counsel, that it should ultimately prevail, there can be no assurances of the outcome at trial. 
    
  ERISA Matters 
    
  In July 2014, the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees  Retirement Income Plan (the  Plan ) settled a putative class action alleging improper calculation of lump sum distributions and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements under the Plan. Under the settlement agreement, the Plan agreed to pay approximately $  40   after application of certain offsets to resolve the litigation.

   14.    Venezuela 
    
  Venezuela has been designated hyper-inflationary and, therefore, the functional currency for the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary ( CP Venezuela ) is the U.S. dollar and Venezuelan currency fluctuations are reported in income.   
    
  During the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted several changes to Venezuela s foreign exchange regime, introducing a multi-tier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert Venezuelan bolivares to U.S. dollars. Although the official exchange rate, as determined by the National Center for Foreign Commerce ( CENCOEX ), remained at   6.30   bolivares per dollar, the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the SICAD I (Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency) currency market. The Venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as SICAD II. The Company remeasures the financial statements of CP Venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, is the SICAD I rate.  
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred net pretax losses of   $327   (  $214   aftertax losses or   $0.23   per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end SICAD I rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014. The SICAD I rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at   12.00   bolivares per dollar as of   December 31, 2014  . Included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government and held by CP Venezuela. Because the official exchange rate remained at   6.30   bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the SICAD I currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds.  
    
  CP Venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its U.S. dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of   6.30   bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by CENCOEX and the liabilities are paid. 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred a pretax loss of   $172   (  $111   aftertax loss or   $0.12   per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from   4.30   to   6.30   bolivares per dollar. 
    
  For the year ended   December 31, 2014  , CP Venezuela represented approximately   3%   of the Company s consolidated Net sales. At   December 31, 2014  , CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the SICAD I rate, was   $549  . This amount includes the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were   $310   at   December 31, 2014   and included   $235   of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if CP Venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to U.S. dollars to fund imports.  
    
  Additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the Company s business in Venezuela and the Company s ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its Venezuelan operations, both of which could result in an impairment of the Company s investment in CP Venezuela.  At   December 31, 2014  , the Company s total investment in CP Venezuela was   $955  , which included intercompany payables of CP Venezuela.

   15.    Segment Information 
    
  The Company operates in   two   product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia.  
    
  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. 
    
  The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock unit awards, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation costs, and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.  
    
  Approximately   80%   of the Company s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with over   50%   of the Company s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe).  
    
  In 2014, Corporate Operating profit (loss) includes charges of   $286   related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, charges of   $327   related to the 2014 Venezuela Remeasurements, charges of   $41   for European competition law matters and costs of   $4   related to the sale of land in Mexico. In 2013, Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $371   related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, a charge of   $172   related to the 2013 Venezuela Remeasurement, a charge of   $23   for a European competition law matter and costs of   $18   related to the sale of land in Mexico. In 2012, Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $89   related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, costs of   $24   related to the sale of land in Mexico and costs of   $21   associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. The various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives included the integration of Sanex, the right-sizing of the Colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in Mississauga, Canada and a Hill s facility in Los Angeles, California.
