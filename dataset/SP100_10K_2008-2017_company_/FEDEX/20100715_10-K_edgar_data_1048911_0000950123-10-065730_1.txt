PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business
services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed
collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four reportable
business segments:

FedEx Express  : Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ) is the world s largest
express transportation company, offering time-certain delivery within one to three business
days and serving markets that comprise more than 90% of the world s gross domestic product.
The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc., which provides
international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air
freight forwarding, and FedEx SupplyChain Systems, Inc., which offers a range of supply chain
solutions. 

FedEx Ground  : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ) is a leading provider of
small-package ground delivery service. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to
every business address in the United States and Canada, as well as residential delivery to
nearly 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. The FedEx Ground
segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc., which specializes in the consolidation and
delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages
using the U.S. Postal Service or Canada Post Corporation for final delivery to any residential
address or PO Box in the United States and Canada. 

FedEx Freight:   FedEx Freight Corporation is a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload
( LTL ) freight services through its FedEx Freight business (fast-transit LTL freight
services) and its FedEx National LTL business (economical LTL freight services). The FedEx
Freight segment also includes FedEx Freight Canada, which offers freight delivery service
throughout Canada, and FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., North America s largest time-specific,
critical shipment carrier. 

FedEx Services:   FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ) provides our other
companies with sales, marketing and information technology support, as well as customer
service support through FedEx Customer Information Services, Inc. The FedEx Services segment
also includes FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ), which provides an array
of printing and business services and retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground
services.

Strategy 

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our
operating companies. Through our holding company, we provide strategic direction to, and
coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending
the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire
portfolio of integrated services.

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the
extensive automation of our package delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated
across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx
companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe
that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple
operating units. For example, our Web site,  fedex.com , provides a single point of contact for our
customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment tracking, customer
service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call
to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air
freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in
order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers
can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery requirements,
time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped.

We manage our business as a portfolio   in the long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a
particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of
delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on
achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each
FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to
optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to
managing collaboratively, our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the
performance of FedEx as a whole.

While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we
continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective
markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit.
Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise.
Each company s operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer
needs of a particular market segment.

Our  compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively  strategy also provides
flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic
conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example, to
accommodate recent and anticipated international growth at FedEx Express, we are adding flights,
purchasing aircraft and improving services to and from Asia, Europe and Latin America based on the
long-term growth prospects of these regions. We have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to
purchase a total of 38 Boeing 777 Freighter ( B777F )

4 

Table of Contents   

aircraft,  a new high-capacity, long-range airplane, six of which have
already been delivered. We also hold an option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. The
B777F enables us to fly between major world markets with lower operating costs, more
freight and in less time than before, allowing later cut-off times for customers in these markets
to drop off their shipments. In addition, we continue to expand network capacity at our growing
FedEx Ground segment.

The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace, and despite
the uncertainty of the current economic environment, we believe they will continue to do so over
the long term:

Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses:   High-tech and high-value-added
goods have increased as a percentage of total economic output, and our various operating
companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and
high-value-added industries. 

Globalization:   As the world s economy has become more fully integrated, companies are
sourcing and selling globally. With customers in more than 220 countries and territories, we
facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information
capabilities. 

Supply Chain Acceleration:   As the economy has become increasingly global, it has also
become more fast-paced, and companies of all sizes now depend on the delivery of just-in-time
inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward faster, more
efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain near real-time information to manage
inventory in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market. 

Growth of E-Commerce:   E-commerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a
vital growth engine for businesses, as the Internet is increasingly being used to purchase
goods and services. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute
to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce. 

These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access   to goods, services and
information. Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we
help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and
capitalize on this access and move toward stronger long-term growth, productivity and
profitability. To this end, we are investing in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding
our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience, such as
investments in B777F aircraft. We also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our
portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, in 2010,
we:

Enhanced FedEx Express overnight services between Asia and Europe, with the introduction of
a new next-business-day service connecting mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore with France
and Germany, and expanded FedEx International Economy and FedEx International Economy Freight
services to more parts of the world. 

Initiated an aggressive plan to expand the global freight forwarding presence of FedEx
Trade Networks   by opening additional facilities (over two dozen new freight forwarding
offices have already been opened) and establishing new alliances throughout the world. 

5 

Table of Contents   

Introduced FedEx SmartPost Returns Services, which provides a convenient way for consumers
to return merchandise back to retailers using the U.S. Postal Service for package pickup. 

Began offering U.S. domestic FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services at all U.S.
OfficeMax retail locations (over 900 locations). These additional staffed drop-off locations
complement our existing retail network, including our FedEx Office centers, and further expand
customer access to our services. 

Reputation and Responsibility 

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the
world s most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the
world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation
awards we received during 2010, FedEx ranked 13 th  in  FORTUNE  magazine s  World s Most
Admired Companies  list   the ninth consecutive year we have been ranked in the top 20 on the list.
In addition, FedEx continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the University of
Michigan Business School National Quality Research Center s  American Customer Satisfaction Index  in
the express delivery category.

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological
innovation, but also in global citizenship. We understand that a sustainable global business is
tied to our global citizenship, and we are committed to connecting the world responsibly and
resourcefully. During 2010, we published an update to our inaugural global citizenship report
(available at  http://csr.fedex.com ). These reports describe how we think about our
responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and include important goals and metrics that
demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities.

Our People  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged
as a great place to work. In 2010, we were listed among FORTUNE s  100 Best Companies to Work for
in America    a list that we have made in 12 of the past 13 years   and  Black Enterprise  magazine s
 40 Best Companies for Diversity    a list that we have made every year since its inception. It is
our people   our greatest asset   that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior
physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 280,000
team members who are  absolutely, positively  focused on safety, the highest ethical and
professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal
Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance
customer service and promote human welfare. For additional information on our people-first
philosophy and workplace initiatives, see  http://csr.fedex.com .

Our Community  

FedEx is committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work worldwide.
We leverage our infrastructure, our people and our philanthropic resources to help these
communities achieve their goals. As an example, we believe that the United Way of America offers
one of the most effective and efficient ways of meeting community needs and have supported the
annual United Way fundraising campaign since 1975. In addition to corporate philanthropy and
employee volunteerism, we maintain relationships with charitable organizations that enable us to
have a strategic impact in key areas, including disaster relief (American Red Cross, Salvation Army
and Heart to Heart International), pedestrian safety (Safe Kids Worldwide), education (Teach for
America and Junior Achievement) and diversity. We support minority access to higher education by
funding scholarships and are a major
sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum. For additional information on our community
involvement and disaster relief efforts, see  http://csr.fedex.com .

The Environment  

In furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment, we have set long-term goals to
reduce aircraft emissions by 20 percent by 2020 on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis,
increase FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20 percent by 2020, and expand on-site renewable
energy generation and procurement of renewable energy credits. To meet our future international
operational needs, as discussed above, we have selected and are beginning to add to our aircraft
fleet the more fuel-efficient B777F. In addition, we are retiring and replacing older Boeing 727s
with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel efficient
aircraft is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel
efficiency. Our hybrid electric delivery fleet is the largest in our industry and has logged more
than five million miles of revenue service. Our solar power generation systems represent another
step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. We
also continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services,
and minimize waste generation through efforts that include recycling, pollution prevention and the
use of copy paper with a high recycled content. For additional information on the ways we are
minimizing our impact on the environment, see  http://csr.fedex.com .

Governance  

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance.
Within the past few years, we have added a number of highly qualified, independent directors to the
Board, including: Steven R. Loranger, the CEO of ITT Corporation; Gary W. Loveman, the CEO of
Harrah s Entertainment; Ambassador Susan C. Schwab, former U.S. Trade Representative; and David P.
Steiner, the CEO of Waste Management. Our Board of Directors
periodically reviews all aspects of our governance
policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are
necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance.
The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees,
including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the
corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at
 http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations . We will post in the corporate governance section of the
Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the
provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required.

Business Segments 

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:

FedEx Express Segment

rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and
territories through one integrated global network. FedEx Express offers time-certain delivery

Table of Contents   

Services 

FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight.
Overnight and deferred package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually
the entire United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight package delivery
services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx
SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S.
destination. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express and deferred freight services backed by
money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the time-definite global freight market.

International express and deferred package delivery with a money-back guarantee is available to
more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct
customer needs. FedEx Express also offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight
services, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance.

For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services  
Technology. 

International Expansion 

We are focused on the long-term expansion of our international presence, especially in key markets
such as China, India, Europe and Latin America.

We began serving mainland China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover
more than 400 cities across the country. Within the past few years, we have taken several
important actions that increase our presence there and bolster our leadership in the global air
cargo industry:

In 2009, we began operations at our new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun
International Airport in Southern China. The new hub assumed and expanded the activities of
our previous hub in Subic Bay, Philippines. The new hub better serves our global customers
doing business in and with the China and Asia-Pacific markets. 

In 2007, we initiated time-certain domestic delivery service in mainland China. Our China
domestic network relies on a hub-and-spoke system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan
International Airport, located in East China s Zhejiang Province, and an extensive ground
network. 

In addition to the aircraft purchases and service enhancements discussed earlier, in support of our
international operations, we recently expanded and substantially increased capacity at our European
hub at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, and at our bonded warehouse at
Guadalajara International Airport in Jalisco, Mexico. To facilitate the use of our growing
international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a
variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with
international shipping requirements. In 2010, we began offering a new technology solution, named
FedEx Electronic Trade Documents, to automate and simplify the
preparation and submission of
customs documentation.

U.S. Postal Service Agreement 

Under an agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx Express
provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its
First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at
U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery
for the U.S. Postal Service s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed
(GXG).

Pricing 

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its
services. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone,
weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx
Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office or FedEx
Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of service provided and
vary with size, weight, destination and, whenever applicable, whether the shipment was picked up by
a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office or
FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based
on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for
shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge
percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for
jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2010 was based on the average spot price for
jet fuel published for April 2010. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated
according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied
effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time,
but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two
weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound
fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2010   6%; 2009  
17%; and 2008   17%. These percentages reflect certain fuel surcharge reductions that are
associated with our annual base rate increases.

Operations 

FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company s
multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In
addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort
Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Guangzhou serve as sorting facilities for express package and
freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and
freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London
and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou and Paris are also designed to serve
as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami   the Miami Gateway Hub  
serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets.

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of
customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the
station s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service
Participants) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more
information about our sorting and handling
facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption  FedEx Express
Segment.

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations.
FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites.
Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office
buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside some U.S. Post Offices.

Fuel Supplies and Costs 

During 2010, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in
length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by
these contracts is purchased at market prices. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not
have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See  FedEx Express   Pricing. 

The following table sets forth FedEx Express s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of
consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:

Approximately 10% of FedEx Express s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The
remainder of FedEx Express s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.

Competition 

As described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ), the express package
and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in
periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon
price, frequency and capacity of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic
coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.

Competitors within the United States include other package delivery concerns, principally United
Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional
express delivery concerns, airfreight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service. FedEx Express s
principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT, other foreign postal authorities, freight
forwarders, passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Express s international
competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater
resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx
Express.

Employees 

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is
headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Express employed approximately
93,000 permanent full-time and 48,000 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 16% are
employed in the
Memphis area. FedEx Express s international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 27%
of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is excellent.

10 

Table of Contents   

The pilots of FedEx Express, who constitute a small percentage of our total employees, are
represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International ( ALPA ), and are employed under a
four-year collective bargaining agreement that will become amendable on October 31, 2010. In
accordance with applicable labor law, we will continue to operate under our current agreement while
we negotiate with our pilots. We cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations or estimate the
impact, if any, that such outcome may have on our operating costs.

Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time
to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S.
domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of
these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.

FedEx Trade Networks  

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and
global ocean and air freight forwarding. During 2010, FedEx Trade Networks initiated an aggressive
plan to expand its global freight forwarding presence   by opening additional facilities (over two
dozen new freight forwarding offices have already been opened) and establishing new alliances
throughout the world. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express
at its major hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool
that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international
trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
(C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs
duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade Networks has
approximately 3,500 employees and 120 offices in 95 service locations throughout North America and
in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Other offices are maintained through dedicated
agents.

FedEx SupplyChain Systems  

Effective September 1, 2009, FedEx SupplyChain Systems (formerly known as FedEx Global Supply Chain
Services and formerly included in the FedEx Services segment) was reorganized as part of the FedEx
Express segment. The company offers a range of supply chain solutions, including critical
inventory logistics, transportation management, fulfillment and fleet services. The company
focuses on information technology-sensitive business to meet the needs of its customers and to
drive transportation business to other FedEx operating companies.

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground  

Overview 

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information
technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive
position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back-guaranteed ground package
delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market,
focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground
service is provided to 100% of the continental United States population and overnight service of up
to 400 miles to
nearly 100% of the continental United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100%
of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through
a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.

11 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by
reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service
in many metropolitan areas. For example, during the most recent two-year period, FedEx Ground has
reduced the transit times of approximately 7,000 of its lanes. FedEx Ground s ongoing network
expansion program is substantially increasing the company s daily pick-up capacity through the
addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing
hubs, and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities.

The company offers FedEx Home Delivery,
which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated exclusively to
meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening
delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home
Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first
residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.

Pricing 

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service
Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone,
weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up by a FedEx Ground
contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Office center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The
surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price
for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example,
the fuel surcharge for June 2010 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April
2010. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index
average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month.
These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each
month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.

Operations 

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 520
facilities, including 32 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations
primarily with approximately 26,300 owner-operated vehicles and 30,400 company-owned trailers. To
provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub
and linehaul network. FedEx Home Delivery s operations are often co-located with existing FedEx
Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages
daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors
electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for
transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and
Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal
package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and
proof-of-delivery signature functionality
through the FedEx Web site,  fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground
e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services   Technology.

Table of Contents   

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations.
FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.

As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Ground had approximately 44,900 employees and 12,100 independent
contractors. David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx
Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS and the
U.S. Postal Service.

Evolution of Independent Contractor Model 

FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations,
as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business
and its customers. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its independent
contractors is generally excellent, the company is involved in numerous lawsuits and other
proceedings (such as state tax audits or other administrative challenges) where the classification
of the contractors is at issue. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ) and Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that, among other things,
provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the
contractors. For example:

FedEx Ground has an ongoing nationwide program to provide greater incentives to contractors
who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. 

In New Hampshire and Maryland, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx
Ground has implemented its Independent Service Provider ( ISP ) model, which requires
pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states to, among other things: (i) assume
responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire geographic service area
that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground,
rather than agree to a standard contract. FedEx Ground is transitioning to the ISP model in
Tennessee, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont
during 2011
and, based upon the success of this model, may in the company s
ordinary course transition to it in other states as well. 

Because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground is requiring its
contractors to (i) be organized as corporations registered and in good standing under
applicable state law, and (ii) treat their personnel who provide services under their
operating agreement with FedEx Ground as their employees. While many contractors already
satisfy these requirements, other contractors will be required to meet these requirements
prior to renewal of their contract, and special incentives are being offered to those who
adopt the change and meet the requirements by the end of February 2011. 

As of May 31, 2010, two thirds of all FedEx Ground service areas nationwide were
supported by multiple-route contractors, which comprise approximately 39% of all FedEx Ground
pickup-and-delivery contractors.

Trademarks 

The  FedEx  trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx,
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx SupplyChain
Systems, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx
SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of
Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file.
We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service
marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business.
In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on
promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

Regulation 

Air . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of
Transportation ( DOT ) and the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) exercise regulatory
authority over FedEx Express.

The FAA s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation,
including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may
from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient
manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of
the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect
so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements
of the regulations.

The DOT s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT s
jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the
transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by
the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of
property and mail on a worldwide basis.

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security
Administration ( TSA ), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility
for aviation security. In July 2007, the TSA issued to us a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator
Standard Security Plan, which contained many new and enhanced security requirements. These
requirements are not static, but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and
legislative requirements, and to respond to evolving threats. Until these requirements are
adopted, we cannot determine the effect that
these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably
possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material
costs on us.

17 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ( CRAF ) program. Under this program,
the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express s
wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx
Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at
standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through
its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo
charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts
with the U.S. Government for such charter flights.

Ground . The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation
services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated
the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air
carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and
insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in
interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation
preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those  at FedEx Express, are subject to
certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and
dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.

International . FedEx Express s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from
points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates
international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against
discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States
carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT s approval and generally requires a bilateral
agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted
the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory
environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to
operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers,
such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation
by foreign governments.

Our operations within foreign countries, such as FedEx Express s growing international domestic
operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict, and sometimes
prohibit, our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market. As an
example, in 2009, the Chinese government adopted postal regulation that excludes foreign-invested
companies such as FedEx from competing in the mainland China domestic document delivery market.

Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its
aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal
Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications
Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express s activities pertaining to satellite
communications.

18 

Table of Contents   

Environmental . Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise.
FedEx
Express s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation
regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have
local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day.
These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express s aircraft operations in some of
the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express s
significant markets. Congress s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established
a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond
to local noise constraints. FedEx Express s international operations are also subject to noise
regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S.
and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including
our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For a description of such efforts and their potential
effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on  Form 10-K 
( Risk Factors ).

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among
other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and
the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office s copy machines. Additionally, we
are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste
handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our
properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with
these regulations.

Customs.  Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to
regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of
Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission
(ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore operations are
subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.

Labor.  All U.S. employees at FedEx Express
are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the  RLA ), while labor relations within the United States at most of our companies are governed by the
National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the  NLRA ). Under the RLA, groups that
wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires
mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board
before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part
of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy.
Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is
not a required step in the negotiation process.

The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As
transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national
transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network,
FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in
1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose)
and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting national (now global) commerce from
damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation
system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the
network.

The U.S. Congress is considering adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for
unions to organize small units of our employees. For example, there is a possibility that Congress
could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the
FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could
disrupt the entire
air/ground network. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).

The B777s are two-engine, wide-bodied cargo aircraft that have a longer range and larger
capacity than any aircraft we operate. 

The MD11s are three-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have a longer range and larger
capacity than DC10s or MD10s. 

The DC10s are three-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have been specially modified to meet
FedEx Express s cargo requirements. 

The MD10s are three-engine, wide-bodied DC10 aircraft that have received an Advanced Common
Flightdeck (ACF) modification, which includes a conversion to a two-pilot cockpit, as well as
upgrades of electrical and other systems. 

The B757s are two-engine, narrow-bodied aircraft configured for cargo service. 

The B727s are three-engine, narrow-bodied aircraft configured for cargo service. 

The ATR and Cessna 208 turbo-prop aircraft are leased to independent operators to support
FedEx Express operations in areas where demand does not justify use of a larger aircraft. 

An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each aircraft type.

In addition, FedEx Express  wet leases  46 smaller piston-engine and turbo-prop aircraft, which
feed packages to and from airports primarily outside the U.S. served by FedEx Express s larger jet
aircraft. The wet lease agreements call for the owner-lessor to provide the aircraft, flight
crews, insurance and maintenance, as well as fuel and other supplies required to operate the
aircraft. FedEx Express s wet lease agreements are for terms not exceeding one year and are
generally cancelable upon 30 days  notice.

At May 31, 2010, FedEx Express operated approximately 49,000 ground transport vehicles, including
pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks called container transport vehicles and over-the-road
tractors and trailers.

Aircraft Purchase Commitments 

The following table is a summary of the number and type of aircraft we were committed to purchase
as of May 31, 2010, with the year of expected delivery:

(1)  
       
     Our obligation to purchase 15 of these aircraft is
conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx
Express or its employees not to be covered by the RLA.
Also, subsequent to May 31, 2010, we entered into an
agreement replacing the previously disclosed non-binding
letter of intent with another party to acquire two
additional B777Fs and expect to take delivery of these
aircraft in 2011. These aircraft are not included in the
table above. 

As of May
31, 2010, deposits and progress payments of $437 million had been made toward aircraft purchases and other
planned aircraft-related transactions. Also see Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for more information about our purchase commitments.

Table of Contents   

FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, which serves as the center of its multiple hub-and-spoke
system, is located at the Memphis International Airport. FedEx Express s facilities at the Memphis
International Airport also include aircraft hangars, aircraft ramp areas, vehicle parking areas,
flight training and fuel facilities, administrative offices and warehouse space. FedEx Express
leases these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the  Authority ). The
lease obligates FedEx Express to maintain and insure the leased property and to pay all related
taxes, assessments and other charges. The lease is subordinate to, and FedEx Express s rights
thereunder could be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and the U.S.
Government.

FedEx Express has additional international sorting-and-handling facilities located at Narita
Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London, and Pearson Airport in Toronto. FedEx Express
also has a substantial presence at airports in Hong Kong; Taiwan; Dubai; Frankfurt; and Miami.
FedEx Express is constructing a state-of-the-art, solar-electric sorting-and-handling facility in
Germany at the Cologne/Bonn airport and intends to relocate the Frankfurt operations there,
beginning later this calendar year.

Administrative and Other Properties and Facilities 

The World Headquarters of FedEx Express is located in southeastern Shelby County, Tennessee. The
headquarters campus comprises nine separate buildings with approximately 1.3 million square feet of
space. FedEx Express also leases 34 facilities in the Memphis area for administrative offices and
warehouses.

FedEx Express owns or leases approximately 700 facilities for city station operations in the United
States. In addition, approximately 400 city stations are owned or leased throughout FedEx
Express s international network. The majority of these leases are for terms of five to ten years.
City stations serve as a sorting and distribution center for a particular city or region. We
believe that suitable alternative facilities are available in each locale on satisfactory terms, if
necessary.

As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Express had approximately 46,000 Drop Boxes, including 5,000 Drop Boxes
outside U.S. Post Offices. As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Express also had approximately 13,000 FedEx
Authorized ShipCenters and other types of staffed drop-off locations, such as FedEx Office centers.
Internationally, FedEx Express had approximately 4,000 drop-off locations.

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground s corporate offices and information and data centers are located in the Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, area in an approximately 500,000 square-foot building owned by FedEx Ground. As of
May 31, 2010, FedEx Ground had approximately 30,400 company-owned trailers and owned or leased 520
facilities, including 32 hubs. In addition, approximately 26,300 owner-operated vehicles support
FedEx Ground s business. Of the 320 facilities that support FedEx Home Delivery, 225 are
co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities. Leased facilities generally have terms of five
years or less. The 32 hub facilities are strategically located to cover the geographic area served
by FedEx Ground. The hub facilities average approximately 325,000 square feet and range in size
from 54,000 to 715,000 square feet.

Administrative offices for the FedEx Freight business are in Harrison, Arkansas, and for the FedEx
National LTL business are in Lakeland, Florida. As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Freight Corporation
operated approximately 60,000 vehicles and trailers and 492 service centers, which are
strategically located to
provide service to virtually all U.S. ZIP Codes. These facilities range in size from 850 to
221,300 square feet of office and dock space. FedEx Custom Critical s headquarters are located in

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services  corporate headquarters are located in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Services and FedEx
Express lease state-of-the-art technology centers in Collierville, Tennessee, Irving, Texas,
Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Orlando, Florida. These facilities house personnel responsible for
strategic software development and other functions that support FedEx s technology and e-commerce
solutions. FedEx Office s corporate headquarters are located in Dallas, Texas in leased
facilities. As of May 31, 2010, FedEx Office operated approximately 1,950 locations, including 135
locations in seven foreign countries, as well as 30 commercial production centers. Substantially
all FedEx Office centers are leased, generally for terms of five to ten years with varying renewal
options. FedEx Office centers are generally located in strip malls, office buildings or
stand-alone structures and average approximately 4,000 square feet in size. We have a multi-year
agreement with OfficeMax to offer U.S. domestic FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services at
all U.S. OfficeMax retail locations (over 900 locations).

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of their business. For a description of material pending legal proceedings, see Note 16 of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

As described below, we have received requests for information from various governmental agencies
over the past four years related to possible anti-competitive behavior in several freight
transportation segments. We do not believe that we have engaged in any anti-competitive
activities, and we are cooperating with these investigations.

In June 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents in connection with
a criminal investigation by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) into
possible anti-competitive behavior in the air freight transportation industry. In July 2007, we
received a notice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) requesting
certain information and documents in connection with the ACCC s investigation into possible
anti-competitive behavior relating to air cargo transportation services in Australia. In December
2007, we received a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents in connection with a
criminal investigation by the DOJ into possible anti-competitive behavior in the international
freight forwarding industry. In March 2008, we received an additional subpoena from the DOJ
relating to its investigation of the international freight forwarding industry. In July 2008, we
received a notice from the Korea Fair Trade Commission ( KFTC ) requesting certain information and
documents in connection with the KFTC s investigation into possible anti-competitive behavior
relating to air cargo transportation services in South Korea. In May 2010, the KFTC determined
that we were not culpable. The DOJ and ACCC investigations are ongoing.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL SECTION 

The financial section of the FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual
Report ) consists of the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition ( MD A ), the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and Other Financial Information, all of which include
information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie
our financial results. The following MD A describes the principal factors affecting the results of
operations, liquidity, capital resources, contractual cash obligations and the critical accounting
estimates of FedEx. The discussion in the financial section should be read in conjunction with the
other sections of this Annual Report, particularly  Item 1: Business  and our detailed discussion
of risk factors included in this MD A.

ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  

Our MD A is comprised of three major sections: Results of Operations, Financial Condition and
Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:

Results of Operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2010 results compared to
2009, and 2009 results compared to 2008. This section also includes a discussion of key
actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2011. 

The overview is followed by a financial summary and analysis (including a discussion of
both historical operating results and our outlook for 2011) for each of our reportable
transportation segments. 

Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity,
capital resources and contractual cash obligations, including a discussion of our cash flow
statements and our financial commitments. 

We conclude with a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are

our reported financial results. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

We provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies
competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected
FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ),
the world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx
Ground ), a leading provider of small-package ground delivery services; and the FedEx Freight LTL
Group, which comprises the FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL businesses of FedEx Freight
Corporation, a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These
companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx
Services ), form the core of our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales,
marketing, information technology and customer service support to our transportation segments. In
addition, the FedEx Services segment provides customers with retail access to FedEx Express and
FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ). See
 Reportable Segments  for further discussion and refer to  Item 1: Business  for a more detailed
description of each of our operating companies.

The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:

the overall customer demand for our various services; 

the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by
our average daily volume and shipment weight; 

the mix of services purchased by our customers; 

the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or
pound or revenue per hundredweight for LTL freight shipments); 

our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to
match shifting volume levels; and 

the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental
fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. 

The majority of our operating expenses are directly impacted by revenue and volume levels.
Accordingly, we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent
with the change in revenues and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions
focuses on the key drivers and trends impacting expenses other than changes in revenues and volume.

Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 or
ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. References to our
transportation segments include, collectively, our FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight
segments.

Overview  

Our results for 2010 reflect the continued impact of the global recession, which negatively
impacted volumes and yields principally in the first half of the fiscal year. A gradual
improvement in economic conditions during the third quarter and a strong fourth quarter
performance, particularly in international shipping volumes at FedEx Express, allowed us to end
2010 with positive momentum. Although revenues declined, our earnings improved in 2010 due to the
inclusion in 2009 of a $1.2 billion charge related to goodwill and other asset impairments. As the
global and U.S. economies began to emerge from recession in the second half of 2010, we experienced
significant volume growth across all of our transportation segments. Our FedEx Ground segment
continued to grow throughout the recession, as customers opted for lower-priced ground
transportation services and we continued to gain market share. Despite higher shipment volumes in
2010, our FedEx Freight segment had a difficult year resulting in an operating loss, as the pricing
environment in the LTL market remained highly competitive due to excess industry capacity.

Changes in fuel surcharges and fuel prices also had a significant negative impact on our earnings
year over year, particularly in the first half of 2010. In addition, our results in 2010 were
impacted by costs associated with the partial reinstatement of several of our employee compensation
programs as a result of improved global economic conditions. The benefits of numerous cost
containment activities implemented in 2009 continued to favorably impact our 2010 results,
principally in the first half of the fiscal year.

In 2009, global economic conditions deteriorated significantly, resulting in lower revenue and
earnings. Our results for 2009 reflected reduced demand for most of our services. Declines in
U.S. domestic volumes at FedEx Express were partially mitigated by the exit of a key competitor
(DHL) from the market, as we gained approximately half of this competitor s total U.S. domestic
shipments. FedEx Express package yields and FedEx Freight LTL Group yields were negatively
impacted by a more competitive pricing environment, as competitors were aggressively seeking to
protect market share and sustain operations during the recession.

-38- 

Table of Contents   

Our operating results for 2009 were also negatively impacted by fourth quarter charges of $1.2
billion, related primarily to the impairment of goodwill related to the Kinko s, Inc. (now FedEx
Office) and Watkins Motor Lines (now FedEx National LTL) acquisitions and certain aircraft-related
assets at FedEx Express. In response to weak business conditions, we implemented several actions
in 2009 to lower our cost structure, including base salary reductions for U.S. salaried personnel,
a suspension of 401(k) company-matching contributions, elimination of variable compensation
payouts, and significant volume-related reductions in labor hours and linehaul expenses. These
cost-reduction activities partially mitigated the impact of the weak global economy on our results
for 2009. Rapidly declining fuel costs during 2009 and the timing lag between such declines and
adjustments to our fuel surcharges provided a significant benefit to our results, predominantly at
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground.

Revenue  

Revenues decreased 2% during 2010 primarily due to yield decreases at FedEx Express and the FedEx
Freight LTL Group as a result of lower fuel surcharges and a continued competitive pricing
environment for our services. At FedEx Express, our weighted-average U.S. domestic and outbound
fuel surcharge was 6.20% in 2010 versus 17.45% in 2009. Increased volumes at all of our
transportation segments due to improved economic conditions in the second half of the fiscal year
partially offset the yield decreases in 2010. At FedEx Express, International Priority ( IP )
package volume increased 10%, led by volume growth in Asia. IP freight and U.S. domestic package
volume growth also contributed to the revenue increase in 2010. At the FedEx Ground segment,
market share gains resulted in a 3% increase in volumes at FedEx Ground and a 48% increase in
volumes at FedEx SmartPost during 2010. At the FedEx Freight LTL Group, discounted pricing drove
an increase in average daily LTL freight shipments, but also resulted in significant yield declines
during 2010.

-40- 

Table of Contents   

Revenues decreased during 2009 due to significantly lower volumes at FedEx Express and the FedEx
Freight LTL Group as a result of reduced demand due to weak economic conditions and lower yields
resulting from an aggressive pricing environment. At FedEx Express, U.S. domestic package and
freight volumes declined and IP volume declined in every major region of the world. However,
declines in U.S. domestic package volumes were partially offset by volumes gained from DHL s exit
from the U.S. market. These volume decreases were also partially offset by yield increases in
FedEx Express freight services driven by higher base rates and higher fuel surcharges in the first
half of 2009. FedEx Freight LTL Group volumes decreased as a result of the recession. Within our
FedEx Ground segment, volumes increased during 2009 due to market share gains, including volumes
gained from DHL and FedEx Express customers who chose to use our more economical ground delivery
services during the recession.

Impairment and Other Charges  

In 2010, we recorded a charge of $18 million for the impairment of goodwill related to the FedEx
National LTL acquisition. Our operating results for 2009 included charges of $1.2 billion ($1.1
billion, net of tax, or $3.45 per diluted share) recorded during the fourth quarter, primarily
related to the impairment of goodwill related to the FedEx Office and FedEx National LTL
acquisitions and certain aircraft-related assets at FedEx Express. The key factor contributing to
the goodwill impairment was a decline in FedEx Office s and FedEx National LTL s actual and
forecasted financial performance as a result of weak economic conditions. The FedEx National LTL
2009 goodwill impairment charge was included in the results of the FedEx Freight segment. The
FedEx Office 2009 goodwill impairment charge was included in the results of the FedEx Services
segment and was not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the
core performance of those businesses.

The majority of our property and equipment impairment charges during 2009 resulted from our  decision to permanently remove from service certain aircraft that we own, along with
certain excess aircraft engines, at FedEx Express. This decision was the result of efforts to
optimize our express network in light of excess aircraft capacity due to weak economic conditions
and the delivery of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Our operating results for 2008 included a charge of $891 million ($696 million, net of tax, or
$2.23 per diluted share) recorded during the fourth quarter, predominantly related to the
impairment of the Kinko s trade name and goodwill resulting from the FedEx Office acquisition.

The impairment of the Kinko s trade name was due to the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s
trade name and rebrand the company as FedEx Office. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from a
decline in the fair value of the FedEx Office reporting unit in light of economic conditions, the
unit s recent and forecasted financial performance and the decision to reduce the rate of network
expansion. The charges were included in the results of the FedEx Services
segment and were not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charges were unrelated to the
core performance of those businesses.

Operating Income  

The following tables compare operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a
percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:

(1)  
       
     Includes a charge of $1.2 billion ($1.1 billion, net of tax, or $3.45 per diluted
share), primarily related to impairment charges associated with goodwill and aircraft
(described above). 

(2)  
       
     Includes a charge of $891 million ($696 million, net of tax, or $2.23 per diluted
share), predominantly related to impairment charges associated with intangible assets from the
FedEx Office acquisition (described above). 

(1)  
       
     Given the fixed-cost structure of our transportation networks, the year-over-year
comparison of our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been affected by a number
of factors, including the impact of lower fuel surcharges, weak economic conditions and our
cost-containment activities. Collectively, these factors have distorted the comparability of
certain of our operating expense captions on a relative basis. 

Operating income and operating margin increased in 2010 primarily as a result of the inclusion in
2009 of the impairment and other charges described above. Volume increases at our package
businesses, particularly in higher-margin IP package and freight services at FedEx Express, also
benefited our 2010 results. Additionally, we continued to benefit in 2010 from several actions
implemented in 2009 to lower our cost structure, including reducing base salaries, optimizing our
networks by adjusting routes and equipment types, permanently and temporarily idling certain
equipment and consolidating facilities; however, these benefits were partially offset by increased
costs in 2010 associated with our variable incentive compensation programs. An operating loss at
the FedEx Freight segment due to continued weakness in the LTL freight market partially offset the
earnings increase.

-42- 

Table of Contents   

Maintenance and repairs expense decreased 10% in 2010 primarily due to the timing of maintenance
events, as lower aircraft utilization as a result of weak economic conditions in the first half of
2010 lengthened maintenance cycles. Other operating expense decreased 6% in 2010 due to actions to
control spending and the inclusion in the prior year of higher self-insurance reserve requirements
at FedEx Ground. Purchased transportation costs increased 4% in 2010 due to increased utilization
of third-party transportation providers associated primarily with our LTL freight service as a
result of higher shipment volumes.

The following graph for our transportation segments shows our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel
per gallon for the years ended May 31:

Fuel
expense decreased 18% during 2010 primarily due to decreases in the
average price per gallon of fuel and fuel consumption, as we lowered
flight hours and improved route efficiencies. In 2010, fuel prices
rose during the beginning of the first quarter and slowly increased,
with significantly less volatility than in 2009. The change in our
fuel surcharges for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground lagged the price increase
by approximately six to eight weeks. Accordingly, based on a static
analysis of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices
compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a
significant negative impact to operating income in 2010. In contrast,
we experienced significant fuel price and fuel surcharge volatility
in 2009, when fuel prices peaked at their historical highs before
beginning to rapidly decrease, which resulted in a significant
benefit to operating income in 2009.

Our analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharges included in the
base rates charged for FedEx Express services. However, this analysis does not consider the
negative effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business, including reduced demand and
shifts by our customers to lower-yielding services. While fluctuations in fuel surcharge rates can
be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual
components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional
components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges we obtain for
these services and the level of pricing discounts offered. In order to provide information about
the impact of fuel surcharges on the trends in revenue and yield growth, we have included the
comparative fuel surcharge rates in effect for 2010, 2009 and 2008 in the accompanying discussions
of each of our transportation segments.

Operating income and operating margin declined significantly in 2009, as weak economic conditions
drove decreases in volumes at FedEx Express and the FedEx Freight LTL Group and contributed to a
more competitive pricing environment that pressured yields. The impairment and other charges
described above also negatively impacted operating income and margin in 2009. Operating income and
margin in 2009 were also negatively impacted by reduced base copy revenues and expenses associated
with organizational changes at FedEx Office. Cost-reduction initiatives partially mitigated the
negative impact of these factors.

-43- 

Table of Contents   

Fuel expenses decreased 14% during 2009, primarily due to decreases in fuel consumption and the
average price per gallon of fuel. Jet fuel usage decreased 9% during 2009, as we reduced flight
hours in light of lower business levels. Fuel prices decreased rapidly and significantly during
2009 after peaking during the first quarter, while changes in fuel surcharges for FedEx Express and
FedEx Ground lagged these decreases by approximately six to eight weeks. We experienced the
opposite effect during 2008, as fuel prices significantly increased. This volatility in fuel
prices and fuel surcharges resulted in a net benefit to income in 2009, based on a static analysis
of the impact to operating income of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to changes in
fuel surcharges.

Other Income and Expense  

Interest expense decreased $6 million during 2010 due to increased capitalized interest primarily
related to progress payments on aircraft purchases. Interest income decreased $18 million during
2010 primarily due to lower interest rates and invested balances. Other expense increased $22
million during 2010 primarily due to higher amortization of financing fees and foreign currency
losses. Interest expense decreased during 2009 due to increased capitalized interest, partially
offset by interest costs on higher debt balances. Interest income decreased during 2009 primarily
due to lower interest rates.

Income Taxes  

Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2010, 85.6% in 2009 and 44.2% in 2008. Our 2009 and 2008 rates
were significantly impacted by goodwill impairment charges that are not deductible for income tax purposes. For 2011, we expect our effective tax rate to be
between 37.0% and 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including
the amount and source of operating income. Additional information on income taxes, including our
effective tax rate reconciliation and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, can be found in Note
10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Outlook  

We expect stronger demand for our services in 2011 and continued growth in revenue and earnings as
global economic conditions continue to improve. We believe the improving economy will result in a
more stable pricing environment, enhancing our ability to execute our strategy to improve yields
across our transportation segments. These yield management initiatives, combined with continued
growth in volumes, are anticipated to improve our margins in 2011. However, we expect our earnings
growth in 2011 to be constrained by a significant increase in pension and retiree medical expenses
($260 million) primarily as a result of a significantly lower discount rate at our May 31, 2010
measurement date. In addition, we anticipate that volume-related increases in aircraft maintenance
expenses, the reinstatement of employee compensation programs and higher healthcare expense due to
continued inflation in the cost of medical services will dampen our earnings growth in 2011. Our
expectations for continued improvement in our results in 2011 are based on a continued recovery in
global economic conditions, the sustainability of which is difficult to predict, and fuel prices
remaining at current forecasted levels.

Our capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be approximately $3.2 billion, as we will
continue to make strategic investments in Boeing 777 Freighter ( B777F ) and Boeing 757 ( B757 )
aircraft, which are substantially more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft type they are
replacing. We are committed to investing in critical long-term strategic projects focused on
enhancing and broadening our service offerings to position us for stronger growth as global
economic conditions continue to improve. For additional details on key 2011 capital projects,
refer to the Liquidity Outlook section of this MD A.

All of our businesses operate in a competitive pricing environment, exacerbated by continuing
volatile fuel prices, which impact our fuel surcharge levels. Historically, our fuel surcharges
have largely offset incremental fuel costs; however, volatility in fuel costs may impact earnings
because adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual fuel prices paid. Therefore, the
trailing impact of adjustments to our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our earnings either
positively or negatively in the short-term.

Table of Contents   

As described in Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the  Independent
Contractor Matters  section of our FedEx Ground segment MD A, we are involved in a number of
lawsuits and other proceedings that challenge the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as
independent contractors. FedEx Ground anticipates continuing changes to its relationships with its
contractors. The nature, timing and amount of any changes are dependent on the outcome of numerous
future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such changes or a
meaningful range of potential outcomes, although they could be material. However, we do not
believe that any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx
Ground business.

See  Risk Factors  for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could
materially affect our future performance.

Seasonality of Business  

Our businesses are seasonal in nature. Seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenues and
earnings. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in
late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks
in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal
quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically
experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping
period for FedEx Ground, while late December, June and July are the slowest periods. For the FedEx
Freight LTL Group, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December,
January and February are the slowest periods. For FedEx Office, the summer months are normally the
slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also
be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly in our third fiscal quarter. 

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and
the comparability of our financial statements. New accounting guidance that has impacted our
financial statements can be found in Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We believe that there is no new accounting guidance adopted but not yet effective that is relevant
to the readers of our financial statements. However, there are numerous new proposals under
development which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial reporting.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  

FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and the FedEx Freight LTL Group represent our major service lines and,
along with FedEx Services, form the core of our reportable segments. Our reportable segments
include the following businesses:

FedEx Express Segment 

FedEx Express (express transportation) 

FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services) 

FedEx SupplyChain Systems (logistics services) 

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery) 

FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator) 

FedEx Freight Segment 

FedEx Freight LTL Group: 

FedEx Freight (fast-transit LTL freight transportation)

FedEx National LTL (economical LTL freight transportation)

FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation) 

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services (sales, marketing and information technology functions)

FedEx Office (document and business services and package
acceptance)

FedEx Customer Information Services ( FCIS ) (customer service,
billings and collections)

FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT  

The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information
technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and
allow us to pursue synergies from the combination of these functions. The FedEx Services segment
includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing and information technology support to our
other companies; FCIS, which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for U.S.
customers of our major business units; and FedEx Office, which provides an array of document and
business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses.
Effective September 1, 2009, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, formerly included in the FedEx Services
reporting segment, was realigned to become part of the FedEx Express reporting segment. Prior year
amounts have not been reclassified to conform to the current year segment presentation, as the
financial results are materially comparable.

The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses
and accordingly we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including
the net operating results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation
businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx Services segment allocation, the net
operating results of FedEx Office are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. We review and
evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of
FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated
based on the impact of the total allocated net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment on our
transportation segments. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as
relative revenues or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net
cost of providing these functions. The $810 million 2009 impairment charge for the FedEx Office
goodwill and the $891 million 2008 charge predominantly associated with impairment of the Kinko s
trade name and goodwill were not allocated to the FedEx Express or FedEx Ground segments, as the
charges were unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

-46- 

Table of Contents   

The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial
summaries of our transportation segments reflects the allocations from the FedEx Services segment
to the respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes
charges and credits for administrative
services provided between operating companies and certain other costs such as corporate management
fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, including executive officers and
certain legal and finance functions. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of
providing these functions.

Effective August 1, 2009, approximately 3,600 employees (predominantly from the FedEx Freight
segment) were transferred to entities within the FedEx Services segment. This internal
reorganization further centralized most customer support functions, such as sales, customer service
and information technology, into our shared services organizations. While the reorganization had
no impact on the net operating results of any of our transportation segments, the net intercompany
charges to our FedEx Freight segment increased significantly with corresponding decreases to other
expense captions, such as salaries and employee benefits. The impact of this internal
reorganization to the expense captions in our other segments was immaterial.

FedEx Services segment revenues, which reflect the operations of only FedEx Office as of September
1, 2009, decreased 10% during 2010 due to revenue declines at FedEx Office and the realignment of
FedEx SupplyChain Systems into the FedEx Express segment effective September 1, 2009. Although
revenue at FedEx Office declined during 2010 due to lower demand for copy services, the allocated
net loss of FedEx Office decreased, as we continued to see benefits from initiatives implemented in
2009 to reduce that company s cost structure. FedEx Services segment revenues decreased 8% during
2009 as revenue generated from new FedEx Office locations added in 2008 and 2009 did not offset
declines in base copy revenues, incremental operating costs associated with the new locations and
expenses associated with organizational changes. Therefore, the
allocated net loss of
FedEx Office increased during 2009 despite ongoing cost management efforts.

OTHER INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS  

Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx
companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated
rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing
segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment
revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated results and are not separately identified
in the following segment information, as the amounts are not material.

FedEx Express Segment Revenues  

FedEx Express segment revenues decreased 4% in 2010 due to lower yields primarily driven by a
decrease in fuel surcharges. Yield decreases during 2010 were partially offset by increased IP
package volume, particularly from Asia, IP freight volume and U.S. domestic package volume due to
improved global economic conditions.

Lower fuel surcharges were the primary driver of decreased composite package and freight yield in
2010. Our weighted-average U.S. domestic and outbound fuel surcharge was 6.20% in 2010, compared
with 17.45% in 2009. U.S. domestic package yield also decreased 10% during 2010 due to lower rates
and lower package weights. In addition to lower fuel surcharges, IP package yield decreased 8%
during 2010 due to lower rates, partially offset by higher package weights and favorable exchange
rates.

FedEx Express segment revenues decreased in 2009 due to a decrease in volumes in virtually all
services as a result of the significant deterioration in global economic conditions and lower
yields driven by unfavorable exchange rates, lower package weights and a more competitive pricing
environment. IP volume declined in every major region of the world. During 2009, volume gains
resulting from DHL s exit from the U.S. domestic market were not enough to offset the negative
impact of weak global economic conditions.

The decrease in composite package yield in 2009 was driven by decreases in U.S. domestic package,
international domestic and IP yields. U.S. domestic package yield decreased in 2009 due to lower
package weights and a lower rate per pound. International domestic yield decreased during 2009 due
to unfavorable exchange rates and a lower rate per pound. IP yield decreased during 2009 due to
unfavorable exchange rates and lower package weights, partially offset by a higher rate per pound.
Composite freight yield increased in 2009 due to general rate increases and higher fuel surcharges.

Our fuel surcharges are indexed to the spot price for jet fuel. Using this index, the U.S.
domestic and outbound fuel surcharge and the international fuel surcharges ranged as follows for
the years ended May 31:

In January 2010, we implemented a 5.9% average list price increase on FedEx Express U.S. domestic
and U.S. outbound express package and freight shipments and made various changes to other
surcharges, while we lowered our fuel surcharge index by two percentage points. Furthermore, in
connection with these changes, the structure of the FedEx Express fuel surcharge table was
modified. In January 2009, we implemented a 6.9% average list price increase on FedEx Express U.S.
domestic and U.S. outbound express package and freight shipments and made various changes to other
surcharges, while we lowered our fuel surcharge index by two percentage points.

FedEx Express Segment Operating Income  

FedEx Express segment operating income and operating margin increased during 2010 due to volume
growth, particularly in higher-margin IP package and freight services. Continued reductions in
network operating costs driven by lower flight hours and improved route efficiencies, as well as
other actions to control spending, positively impacted our results for 2010. Our 2010
year-over-year results were also positively impacted by a $260 million charge in 2009 related to
aircraft-related asset impairments and other charges primarily associated with aircraft-related
lease and contract termination costs and employee severance.

Table of Contents   

Fuel costs decreased 19% in 2010 due to decreases in the average price per gallon of fuel and fuel
consumption. Based on a static analysis of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices
compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a significant negative impact to
operating income in 2010. This analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel
surcharges included in the base rates charged for FedEx Express services.

Maintenance and repairs expense decreased 16% in 2010 primarily due to the timing of maintenance
events, as lower aircraft utilization as a result of weak economic conditions, particularly in the
first half of 2010, lengthened maintenance cycles. Purchased transportation costs increased 6% in
2010 primarily due to higher air volume and costs in our freight forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks.
Depreciation expense increased 6% in 2010 primarily due to the addition of 21 aircraft placed into
service during the year. Intercompany charges decreased 8% in 2010 primarily due to lower
allocated information technology costs and lower net operating costs at FedEx Office.

FedEx Express segment operating income and operating margin declined in 2009 as a result of the
weak global economy and high fuel prices in the first half of 2009, both of which limited demand
for our U.S. domestic package and IP services.

During 2009, in response to weak business conditions, we implemented several actions to lower our
cost structure, including significant volume-related reductions in flight and labor hours. We also
lowered fuel consumption and maintenance costs, as we temporarily grounded a limited number of
aircraft due to excess capacity. Our cost-containment activities also included deferral of
merit-based pay increases. All of these actions partially mitigated the impact of lower volumes on
our results.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we took additional actions to align the size of our networks to
current demand levels by removing equipment and facilities from service and reducing personnel. As
a result of these actions, we recorded charges of $199 million for the impairment of certain
aircraft and aircraft engines and $57 million for aircraft-related lease and contract termination
and employee severance costs related to workforce reductions.

Fuel costs decreased in 2009 due to decreases in fuel consumption and the average price per gallon
of fuel. Fuel surcharges were sufficient to offset fuel costs for 2009, based on a static analysis
of the impact to operating income of the year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to changes
in fuel surcharges. This analysis considers the estimated benefits of the reduction in fuel
surcharges included in the base rates charged for FedEx Express services. However, this analysis
does not consider the negative effects that the significantly higher fuel surcharge levels have on
our business, including reduced demand and shifts to lower-yielding services. Maintenance and
repairs expense decreased primarily due to a volume-related reduction in flight hours and the
permanent and temporary grounding of certain aircraft due to excess capacity.

FedEx Express Segment Outlook  

We expect revenue growth at FedEx Express in 2011 to be driven by international package and freight
volumes as global economic conditions continue to improve. Revenue growth in 2011 will also be
driven by continued expansion of our international economy services, as well as improved yields
primarily due to higher fuel surcharges.

FedEx Express segment operating income and operating margin are expected to increase in 2011,
driven by continued growth in international package and freight services and productivity
enhancements. However, we anticipate that volume-related increases in aircraft maintenance
expenses, the reinstatement of several employee compensation programs, increased pension and
retiree medical expenses and higher healthcare expense due to continued inflation in the cost of
medical services will dampen our earnings growth in 2011.

Capital expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to increase in 2011, driven by incremental
investments for the new B777F aircraft. These aircraft capital expenditures are necessary to
achieve significant long-term operating savings and to support projected long-term international
volume growth.

FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT  

The following tables compare revenues, operating expenses, operating expenses as a percent of
revenue, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions) and selected package
statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31:

FedEx Ground Segment Revenues  

FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 6% during 2010 due to volume growth at both FedEx Ground
and FedEx SmartPost, partially offset by declines in yield at FedEx SmartPost.

FedEx Ground average daily volume increased 3% during 2010 due to continued growth in our
commercial business and our FedEx Home Delivery service. The slight yield improvement at FedEx
Ground during 2010 was primarily due to higher base rates and increased extra service revenue, but was mostly offset by
higher customer discounts and lower fuel surcharges.

-52- 

Table of Contents   

FedEx SmartPost volumes grew 48% during 2010 primarily as a result of market share gains, while
yields decreased 14% during 2010 due to changes in customer and service mix. For example, certain
customers elected to utilize lower-yielding service offerings that did not require standard pickup
and linehaul services.

FedEx Ground segment revenues increased in 2009 due to yield improvement at FedEx Ground and volume
growth at both FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground volume growth during 2009 resulted
from market share gains, including volumes gained from DHL s exit from the U.S. market, and
continued growth in the FedEx Home Delivery service. FedEx Ground volumes also benefited from
existing FedEx Express customers  opting for lower-cost FedEx Ground offerings. Yield improvement
at FedEx Ground during 2009 was primarily due to higher base rates (partially offset by higher
customer discounts), increased extra service revenue and higher fuel surcharges. FedEx SmartPost
volume growth during 2009 resulted from market share gains, including volumes gained from DHL s
exit from the U.S. market. Yields at FedEx SmartPost decreased during 2009 due to changes in
customer and service mix.

The FedEx Ground fuel surcharge is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway
average prices for a gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. Our fuel
surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:

In January 2010, we implemented a 4.9% average list price increase and made various changes to
other surcharges, including modifying the fuel surcharge table, on FedEx Ground shipments. In
January 2009, we implemented a 5.9% average list price increase and made various changes to other
surcharges on FedEx Ground shipments.

FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income  

FedEx Ground segment operating income and operating margin increased during 2010 due to higher
package volume, lower self-insurance expenses and improved productivity. Improved performance at
FedEx SmartPost also contributed to the operating income and operating margin increase. In 2010,
FedEx Ground segment operating income exceeded $1 billion on an annual basis for the first time.

The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense during 2010 was primarily due to accruals
for our variable incentive compensation programs, increased staffing at FedEx SmartPost to support
volume growth and increased healthcare costs. Purchased transportation costs increased 2% during
2010 primarily as a result of higher package volume. Rent expense increased during 2010 primarily
due to higher spending on facilities associated with our multi-year network expansion plan.
Intercompany charges increased 12% in 2010 primarily due to higher allocated information technology
costs (formerly direct charges). Other operating expense decreased during 2010 due to higher
self-insurance reserve requirements in 2009.

FedEx Ground segment operating income and operating margin increased during 2009 primarily due to
the timing impact of fuel surcharges and yield growth. Rapidly declining fuel costs and the timing
lag between such declines and adjustments to our fuel surcharges provided a significant benefit to
FedEx Ground results for 2009.

Rent expense and depreciation expense increased during 2009 primarily due to higher spending on
material handling equipment and facilities associated with our multi-year network expansion plan.
Purchased transportation costs increased in 2009 as a result of higher rates paid to our
independent contractors and costs associated with our independent contractor programs (described below), partially offset by a
decrease in fuel costs. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense during 2009 was
partially offset by the base salary reductions and suspension of 401(k) company matching
contributions described in the Overview section. Intercompany charges increased during 2009
primarily due to allocated telecommunication expenses (formerly a direct charge), higher general
and administrative costs and higher allocated customer service costs. Other operating expenses
increased during 2009 primarily due to higher reserve requirements for liability insurance. Lower
legal costs, including settlements, partially offset the increase in other operating expenses in
2009.

Independent Contractor Matters  

FedEx
 Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations,
as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business
and its customers. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with independent contractors is
generally excellent, the company is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as
state tax audits or other administrative challenges) where the classification of the contractors is
at issue. For a description of these proceedings, see Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with contractors that, among other things,
provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the
contractors. For example:

FedEx Ground has an ongoing nationwide program to provide greater incentives to contractors
who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. 

In New Hampshire and Maryland, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx
Ground has implemented its Independent Service Provider
( ISP ) model, which requires
pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states to, among other things: (i) assume
responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire geographic service area
that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground,
rather than agree to a standard contract. FedEx Ground is transitioning to the ISP model in
Tennessee, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont
during 2011 and, based upon the success of this model, may
in the company s ordinary course
transition to it in other states as well. 

Because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground is requiring its
contractors to (i) be organized as corporations registered and in good standing under
applicable state law, and (ii) treat their personnel who provide services under their
operating agreement with FedEx Ground as their employees. While many contractors already
satisfy these requirements, other contractors will be required to meet these requirements
prior to renewal of their contract, and special incentives are being offered to those who
adopt the change and meet the requirements by the end of February 2011. 

As of May 31, 2010, two thirds of all FedEx Ground service areas nationwide were
supported by multiple-route contractors, which comprise approximately 39% of all FedEx Ground
pickup-and-delivery contractors. 

We anticipate continuing changes to FedEx Ground s relationships with its contractors, the nature,
timing and amount of which are dependent on the outcome of numerous future events. We do not
believe that any of these changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx
Ground business.

FedEx Ground Segment Outlook  

We expect the FedEx Ground segment to have continued revenue growth in 2011, led by increases in
commercial, FedEx Home Delivery and FedEx SmartPost volumes due to market share gains. Yields for
all services at FedEx Ground are expected to improve in 2011 as a result of increases in list
prices.

FedEx Ground segment operating income in 2011 is expected to increase due to revenue growth and
productivity enhancements. Higher purchased transportation costs due to higher rates paid to our
independent contractors will offset a portion of these benefits.

-54- 

Table of Contents   

Capital spending is expected to increase in 2011 with the majority of our spending resulting from
our continued network expansion and productivity-enhancing technologies. We are committed to
investing in the FedEx Ground network because of the long-term benefits we will experience from
these investments.

We will continue to vigorously defend various attacks against our independent contractor model and
incur ongoing legal costs as a part of this process. While we believe that FedEx Ground s
owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors, it is reasonably possible that
we could incur a material loss in connection with one or more of these matters or be required to
make material changes to our contractor model. However, we do not believe that any such changes
will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business.

FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT  

The following tables compare revenues, operating expenses, operating expenses as a percent of
revenue, operating (loss)/income and operating margin (dollars in millions) and selected statistics
for the years ended May 31:

(1)  
       
     Certain functions were transferred from the FedEx Freight segment to FedEx
Services and FCIS effective August 1, 2009 (as described below). For 2010, the costs associated
with these functions, previously a direct charge, were allocated to the FedEx Freight segment
through intercompany allocations. 

(2)  
       
     Includes Caribbean Transportation Services, which was merged into FedEx Express
effective June 1, 2009. 

(3)  
       
     Represents impairment charges associated with goodwill related to the
FedEx National LTL acquisition. The charge  in 2009 also includes other charges primarily associated with employee
severance. 

-55- 

Table of Contents   

(1)  
       
     Given the fixed-cost structure of our transportation networks, the year-over-year comparison of our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been affected by a number of factors,
including the impact of lower fuel surcharges, the competitive pricing environment, weak economic conditions and our cost-containment activities. Collectively, these factors have distorted
the comparability of certain of our operating expense captions on a relative basis. 

(2)  
       
     Represents impairment charges associated with goodwill
 related to the FedEx National LTL acquisition. The charge  in 2009
also includes  other charges primarily associated with employee severance.  

(3)  
       
     Certain functions were transferred from the FedEx Freight segment to FedEx Services and FCIS effective August 1, 2009 (as described below). For 2010, the costs associated with these
functions, previously a direct charge, were allocated to the FedEx Freight segment through intercompany allocations. 

FedEx Freight Segment Revenues  

FedEx Freight segment revenues decreased 2% during 2010 due to lower LTL yield and the merger of
Caribbean Transportation Services into FedEx Express effective June 1, 2009, mostly offset by
higher average daily LTL shipments. LTL yield decreased 10% during 2010 due to a continuing highly
competitive LTL freight market, resulting from excess capacity and lower fuel surcharges.
Discounted pricing drove an increase in average daily LTL shipments of 11% during 2010.

FedEx Freight segment revenues decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in average daily LTL
shipments and lower LTL yield. Average daily LTL shipments decreased during 2009 as a result of
the economic recession, which resulted in the weakest LTL environment in decades. LTL yield
decreased during 2009 due to the effects of the competitive pricing environment and lower fuel
surcharges.

The indexed LTL fuel surcharge is based on the average of the national U.S. on-highway average
prices for a gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. The indexed LTL fuel
surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:

In February 2010, we implemented 5.9% general rate increases for FedEx Freight and FedEx
National LTL shipments. In January 2009, we implemented 5.7% general rate increases for FedEx
Freight and FedEx National LTL shipments.

-56- 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Freight Segment Operating (Loss)/Income  

A weak pricing environment, which led to aggressive discounting for our LTL freight services,
resulted in an operating loss in 2010 at the FedEx Freight segment. The actions implemented in
2009 to lower our cost structure were more than offset by the negative impacts of lower LTL yields
and higher volume-related costs, as significantly higher shipment levels required increased
purchased transportation and other expenses during 2010. In addition, we recorded a charge of $18
million for the impairment of the remaining goodwill related to the FedEx National LTL acquisition.
Year-over-year comparisons in 2010 were affected by a $90 million goodwill impairment charge in
2009 related to the FedEx National LTL acquisition and a $10 million charge in 2009 primarily
related to employee severance.

Intercompany charges increased in 2010 due to expenses associated with the functions of
approximately 2,700 FedEx Freight segment employees that were transferred to FedEx Services and
FCIS in the first quarter of 2010. The costs of these functions were previously a direct charge.
As described above in the FedEx Services Segment section, these employees represented the sales,
information technology, marketing, pricing, customer service, claims and credit and collection
functions of the FedEx Freight segment and were transferred to allow further centralization of
these functions into the FedEx Services segment shared service organization. For 2010, the costs
of the functions were charged to the FedEx Freight segment through intercompany charges with an
offsetting reduction in direct charges, primarily salaries and employee benefits. These transfers
had no net impact to operating income, although they significantly increased our intercompany
allocations.

Purchased transportation costs increased 28% in 2010 due to increased utilization of third-party
transportation providers, which were required to support higher shipment volumes. Fuel costs
decreased 14% during 2010 due to a lower average price per gallon of diesel fuel, partially offset
by increased fuel consumption as a result of higher shipment volumes. Based on a static analysis
of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in
fuel surcharges, fuel had a negative impact to operating income in 2010. Rent expense decreased
17% and other operating expense decreased 11% in 2010 due to the merger of Caribbean Transportation
Services into FedEx Express effective June 1, 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased 12% in 2010 due to the impact of the transfer of employees from the FedEx Freight segment
to FedEx Services and FCIS during the first quarter of 2010.

In 2009, the decrease in average daily LTL shipments and the competitive pricing environment driven
by the U.S. recession and excess capacity in the market had a significant negative impact on
operating income and operating margin. In addition, during 2009, we recorded a charge of $90
million related to the impairment of goodwill related to the FedEx National LTL acquisition and a
charge of $10 million primarily related to employee severance.

Fuel costs decreased during 2009 due primarily to a lower average price per gallon of diesel fuel
and decreased fuel consumption due to lower volume levels. Based on a static analysis of the
year-over-year changes in fuel costs compared to changes in fuel surcharges, fuel surcharges offset
the impact of fuel costs for 2009. However, this analysis does not consider other effects that
fuel prices and related fuel surcharge levels have on our business, including changes in customer
demand and the impact on base rates and rates paid to our third-party transportation providers.
Purchased transportation costs decreased during 2009 primarily due to lower shipment volumes and
decreased utilization of third-party providers. Maintenance and repairs expense decreased in 2009
primarily due to lower shipment volumes and rebranding costs for FedEx National LTL incurred in
2008. Rent expense increased during 2009 primarily due to service center expansions related to
strategically investing in key markets for long-term growth. Intercompany charges increased during
2009 primarily due to allocated telecommunication expenses (formerly a direct charge) and higher
allocated information technology costs from FedEx Services.

FedEx Freight Segment Outlook  

During 2011, the FedEx Freight segment will focus on several strategic initiatives to improve
productivity and yields. We expect volume growth to moderate later in 2011 as we continue to
enhance our pricing discipline in an improving economy. This pricing discipline, which will come through a combination of general rate
increases and renewal of terms with contractual customers, is expected to improve yields in 2011.
Even with these expected improvements in yield, excess industry capacity is likely to remain and
will continue to negatively impact our short-term operating performance. We expect productivity to
improve as our LTL networks stabilize and we continue to evaluate our networks in light of the
pricing environment and the competitive landscape, and will make changes where appropriate to
improve our long-term profitability.

Capital spending is expected to decline in 2011 with the majority of our spending resulting from
the replacement of transportation and handling equipment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

LIQUIDITY  

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion at May 31, 2010, compared to $2.3 billion at May 31,
2009. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in
millions):

Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  Cash flows from operating activities increased $385
million in 2010 primarily due to the receipt of income tax refunds of $279 million and increased
income. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $712 million in 2009 primarily due to
reduced income and a $600 million increase in contributions to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic
pension plans ( U.S. Retirement Plans ), partially offset by a $307 million reduction in income tax
payments. We made tax-deductible contributions of $848 million to our U.S. Retirement Plans during
2010, including $495 million in voluntary contributions. We made tax-deductible voluntary
contributions of $1.1 billion to our U.S. Retirement Plans during 2009 and $479 million during
2008.

Cash Used in Investing Activities . Capital expenditures during 2010 were 15% higher largely due to
increased spending at FedEx Express. Capital expenditures during 2009 were 17% lower largely due
to decreased spending at FedEx Express and FedEx Services. See  Capital Resources  for a
discussion of capital expenditures during 2010 and 2009.

-58- 

Table of Contents   

Debt Financing Activities . We have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows
us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and
common stock. During 2010, we repaid our $500 million 5.50% notes that matured on August 15, 2009
using cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds of our January 2009 $1 billion senior
unsecured debt offering. During 2010, we made principal payments in the amount of $153 million
related to capital lease obligations.

A $1 billion revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations and other cash flow
needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The revolving credit agreement
expires in July 2012. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a
leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus
six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus
total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 0.7 to 1.0. Our leverage ratio of
adjusted debt to capital was 0.5 at May 31, 2010. Under this financial covenant, our additional
borrowing capacity is capped, although this covenant continues to provide us with ample liquidity,
if needed. We are in compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants of our revolving
credit agreement and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations, including our liquidity
or borrowing capacity. As of May 31, 2010, no commercial paper was outstanding and the entire $1
billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings.

Dividends.  We paid cash dividends of $138 million in 2010, $137 million in 2009 and $124 million
in 2008. On June 7, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share
of common stock, an increase of $0.01 per share. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2010 to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2010. Each quarterly dividend
payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend
payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.

CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft,
vehicles, technology, facilities, package-handling and sort equipment. The amount and timing of
capital additions depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments,
anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced
services, geographical expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of
regulatory authorities.

The following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the
years ended May 31 (in millions):

Capital expenditures during 2010 were higher than the prior year primarily due to increased
spending at FedEx Express for aircraft and aircraft-related equipment. Aircraft and
aircraft-related equipment purchases at FedEx Express during 2010 included six new B777Fs, the
first of which entered revenue service during the second quarter of 2010, and 12 B757s. FedEx Services capital expenditures increased in 2010 due to
information technology facility expansions and projects. Capital spending at FedEx Ground
decreased in 2010 due to decreased spending for facilities and sort equipment and vehicles.
Capital expenditures decreased during 2009 primarily due to decreased spending at FedEx Express for
facilities and aircraft and aircraft-related equipment and decreased spending at FedEx Services due
to the planned reduction in FedEx Office network expansion, as well as decreased spending and the
postponement of several information technology projects.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available
financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, including working capital, capital
expenditure requirements and debt payment obligations. Although we expect higher capital
expenditures in 2011, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund
these expenditures. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining unsecured financing, from
both domestic and international sources, although the marketplace for such investment capital can
become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors.

Our capital expenditures are expected to be $3.2 billion in 2011 and will include spending for
aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express, network expansion at FedEx Ground and revenue
equipment at the FedEx Freight segment. We expect approximately 65% of capital expenditures in
2011 will be designated for growth initiatives and 35% for ongoing maintenance activities. Our
expected capital expenditures for 2011 include $1.7 billion in investments for aircraft and related
equipment at FedEx Express, such as the new B777Fs and the B757s, which are substantially more
fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft type they are replacing. Our aircraft spending is
expected to be higher in 2011 than in previous years due to the acceleration of delivery and
additional acquisitions of B777Fs. We have agreed to purchase a total of 38 B777F aircraft (34
from Boeing and four from other parties), six of which have been delivered, and hold options to
purchase up to 15 additional B777F aircraft from Boeing. Our obligation to purchase 15 of these
aircraft is conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx Express or its employees not to
be covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended. These aircraft-related capital
expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to support
projected long-term international volume growth. Our ability to delay the timing of these
aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing
purchase agreements.

As noted above, during 2010, we made $848 million in tax-deductible contributions to our U.S.
Retirement Plans, including $495 million in voluntary contributions. Our U.S. Retirement Plans
have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments. For 2011, we anticipate making required
contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans totaling approximately $500 million, a reduction from
2010 due to the use of an available credit balance to reduce otherwise required pension
contributions.

Standard   Poor s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB and commercial paper
rating of A-2 and a ratings outlook of  stable.  During the third quarter of 2010, Moody s
Investors Service reaffirmed our senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2 and commercial paper
rating of P-2 and raised our ratings outlook to  stable.  If our credit ratings drop, our interest
expense may increase. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have
difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop
below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.

In 2011, we have scheduled debt payments of $270 million, which includes $250 million of principal
payments on unsecured notes maturing in February 2011 and principal and interest payments on
capital leases.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS  

The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2010.
Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are
disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Except for the current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, this table
does not include amounts already recorded in our balance sheet as current liabilities at May 31, 2010. Accordingly, this table is not meant to represent a forecast of our
total cash expenditures for any of the periods presented.

(1)  
       
     Subsequent to May 31, 2010, we entered into an agreement replacing the previously
disclosed non-binding letter of intent to acquire two additional B777Fs and expect to take delivery
of these aircraft in 2011. These aircraft are not included in the table above. 

We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities
are not included in the table above.

We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income
taxes, qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement healthcare plan liabilities and other
self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not
reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of
these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable within 12 months,
which are included in current liabilities. Included in the table above are anticipated quarterly
contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans totaling approximately $500 million for 2011 that begin
in the first quarter.

Operating Activities 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, future
contractual payments under our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. Credit
rating agencies routinely use information concerning minimum lease payments required for our
operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. The amounts reflected in the table above for
operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
(principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at
May 31, 2010. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain
other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of  off-balance sheet financing ). At the
time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide
economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity or after-tax cash
flows.

The amounts reflected for purchase obligations represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods
or services that are not capital related. Such contracts include those for printing and
advertising and promotions contracts. Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered
unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the
table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for more information.

Included in the table above within the caption entitled  Non-capital purchase obligations and
other  is our estimate of the current portion of the liability
($1 million) for uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which
the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the
liability ($81 million) is excluded from the table. See Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further information.

The amounts reflected in the table above for interest on long-term debt represent future interest
payments due on our long-term debt, all of which are fixed rate.

Investing Activities 

The amounts reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligations represent noncancelable
agreements to purchase capital-related equipment. Such contracts include those for certain
purchases of aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles, facilities, computers and other equipment
contracts. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do not include the
attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered into
noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft. Open purchase orders that are cancelable are
not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not
included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase
rather than binding agreements. See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
for more information.

Financing Activities 

We have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments, not reflected in the
table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations,
including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required
under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international
operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance
sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the surety bonds and
letters of credit themselves.

The amounts reflected in the table above for long-term debt represent future scheduled payments on
our long-term debt. In 2011, we have scheduled debt payments of $270 million, which includes $250
million of principal payments on our 7.25% unsecured notes maturing in February 2011, and principal
and interest payments on capital leases.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop
amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative
policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the
application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates
that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However,
even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing
circumstances and new or better information.

The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most
judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are
material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of
these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our
independent registered public accounting firm.

RETIREMENT PLANS 

OVERVIEW . We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These
programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and postretirement
healthcare plans.

We made significant changes to our retirement plans during 2008 and 2009. Beginning January 1,
2008, we increased the annual company-matching contribution under the largest of our 401(k) plans
covering most employees from a maximum of $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of eligible compensation.
Employees not participating in the 401(k) plan as of January 1, 2008 were automatically enrolled at
3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible pay effective March 1, 2008. As a
temporary cost-control measure, we suspended 401(k) company-matching contributions effective
February 1, 2009. We reinstated these contributions at 50% of previous levels for most employees
effective January 1, 2010.

Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a
traditional pension benefit formula (based on average earnings and years of service) were capped
for most employees, and those benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Effective June 1,
2008, future pension benefits for most employees began to be accrued under a cash balance formula
we call the Portable Pension Account. These changes did not affect the benefits of previously
retired and terminated vested participants. In addition, these pension plans were modified to
accelerate vesting from five years to three years for most participants.

Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a
notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service,
and interest on the notional account balance. Under the tax-qualified plans, the pension benefit
is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. An
employee s pay credits are determined each year under a graded formula that combines age with years
of service for points. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S.
Treasury index.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING . The current rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce
tremendous volatility in our results, financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is
primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our
pension liability at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the measurement date).
Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which in recent
years have experienced substantial volatility.

In addition to expense volatility, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments to our
balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our
pension and
postretirement healthcare  plans. These adjustments
have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and like our pension expense, are a
result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at the measurement date. The funded
status of our plans also impacts our liquidity, as current funding laws require increasingly
aggressive funding levels for our pension plans.

Our retirement plans cost is included in the  Salaries and Employee Benefits  caption in our
consolidated income statements. A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years
is as follows (in millions):

Total retirement plans cost increased $15 million in 2010, primarily due to the negative impact of
market conditions on our pension plan assets at our May 31, 2009 measurement date, mostly offset by
lower expenses for our 401(k) plans due to the temporary suspension of the company-matching
contributions. Those matching contributions were reinstated generally at 50% of their normal
levels on January 1, 2010. Total retirement plans cost decreased $145 million in 2009, primarily
due to a higher discount rate.

Retirement plans cost in 2011 is expected to increase significantly. This increase is attributable
to an increase in pension plan and retiree medical expense of approximately $260 million, primarily
as a result of a significantly lower discount rate.

-63- 

Table of Contents   

PENSION COST.  The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous
assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future
salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These assumptions most
significantly impact our U.S. domestic pension plans. The components of pension cost for all
pension plans are as follows (in millions):

Pension cost was higher in 2010 by $131 million due to significant declines in the value of our
plan assets due to market conditions at the end of 2009, partially offset by a higher discount
rate.

Following is a discussion of the key estimates we consider in determining our pension cost:

DISCOUNT RATE . This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments
that have been accrued to date (the projected benefit obligation, or
 PBO ) to their net present
value and to determine the succeeding year s pension expense. The discount rate is determined each
year at the plan measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense. The
discount rate affects the PBO and pension expense based on the measurement dates, as described
below.

(1)  
       
     Accounting rules required us to change our measurement date to May 31,
beginning in 2009. 

We determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a
theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that
generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. In developing this theoretical
portfolio, we select bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit our concentration by
industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to ensure bonds with a call feature have a low
probability of being called. To the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit
payments in a given period, the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at
one-year forward rates.

The decrease in the discount rate for 2011 was driven by conditions in the market for high-grade
corporate bonds, where yields have decreased significantly since May 31, 2009. The discount rate
assumption is highly sensitive, as the following table illustrates with our largest tax-qualified
U.S. domestic pension plan:

-64- 

Table of Contents   

At our May 31, 2010 measurement date, a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would have
decreased our 2010 PBO by approximately $900 million and a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount
rate would have increased our 2010 PBO by approximately $1.0 billion.

PLAN ASSETS.  The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking
assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future
long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in
listed securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that
is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our
strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a
liability-driven investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities to
better align plan assets with liabilities.

Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental
matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can
employ with our pension plan assets; 

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected
compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time;
and 

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to
achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed
funds. 

We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.

To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by
third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These
studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation
of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate
probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The following table summarizes our
current asset allocation strategy (dollars in millions):

We have assumed an 8% compound geometric long-term rate of return on our U.S. domestic pension
plan assets for 2011 and 2010 and 8.5% in 2009 and 2008, as described in Note 11 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. A one-basis-point change in our expected return on
plan assets impacts our pension expense by $1.3 million.

The actual historical return on our U.S. pension plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric
basis, was approximately 7.9%, net of investment manager fees, for the 15-year period ended May 31,
2010 and 7.5%, net of investment manager fees, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2009.

-65- 

Table of Contents   

Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan
assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value method to determine the value of plan
assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and
decreases) by amortizing certain actuarial gains or losses over a period no longer than four years.
Another method used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date.
The calculated-value method significantly mitigated the impact of asset value declines in the
determination of our 2010 pension expense, reducing our 2010 expense by approximately $135 million.
For purposes of valuing plan assets for determining 2011 pension expense, the calculated-value method will result in the same value as the market value, as it did in 2009.

FUNDED STATUS.  Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of May 31 (in millions):

The amounts recognized in the balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term
pension liabilities at the plan measurement date and the effect of mark-to-market accounting on
plan assets. At May 31, 2010, we recorded a decrease to equity through OCI of $1.0 billion (net of
tax) to reflect unrealized actuarial losses during 2010. Those losses are subject to amortization
over future years and may be reflected in future income statements unless they are recovered. At
May 31, 2009, we recorded a decrease to equity through OCI of $1.2 billion (net of tax)
attributable to our pension plans.

The funding requirements for our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans are governed by the
Pension Protection Act of 2006, which has aggressive funding requirements in order to avoid benefit
payment restrictions that become effective if the funded status determined under IRS rules falls
below 80% at the beginning of a plan year. All of our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans had
funded status levels in excess of 80% and our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to
our employees as they come due. Additionally, current benefit payments are nominal compared to our
total plan assets (benefit payments for our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans for 2010 were
approximately $355 million or 3% of plan assets).

-66- 

Table of Contents   

During 2010, we made $848 million in tax-deductible contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans,
including $495 million in voluntary contributions. Over the past several years, we have made
voluntary contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans in excess of the minimum required
contributions. Amounts contributed in excess of the minimum required result in a credit balance
for funding purposes that can be used to meet minimum contribution requirements in future years.
For 2011, we anticipate making required contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans totaling
approximately $500 million, a reduction from 2010 due to the use of a portion of our credit
balance.

Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses were $5.2 billion through May 31, 2010, compared to $3.7
billion through May 31, 2009. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the discount rates and
differences between expected and actual asset returns, which are being amortized over future
periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains.
However, unless they are below a corridor amount, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required
to be amortized and recognized in future periods. For example, projected U.S. domestic pension
plan expense for 2011 includes $276 million of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $125
million in 2010, $44 million in 2009 and $162 million in 2008.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS  

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers  compensation claims,
vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and
long-term disability programs. Our reserves are established for estimates of loss on reported
claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. At May 31, 2010, there were $1.6 billion of
self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet ($1.5 billion at May 31, 2009).
Approximately 40% of these accruals were classified as current liabilities in 2010 and 2009.

Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of
claims to provide us with estimates of future claim costs based on claims incurred as of the
balance sheet date. These estimates include consideration of factors such as severity of claims,
frequency of claims and future healthcare costs. Cost trends on material accruals are updated each
quarter. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk.
Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk
tolerance and premium expense. Historically, it has been infrequent that incurred claims exceeded
our self-insured limits. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include
measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments based on historical development factors.

We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and
effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation
technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the
length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these
expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare
costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels and other factors can materially
affect the estimates for these liabilities. For example, during 2009, FedEx Ground recorded $70
million in incremental self-insurance reserves for liability insurance based on adverse experience
on bodily injury claims.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Our key businesses are capital intensive, with approximately 58% of our
total assets invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize
only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards.
Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not
part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as incurred. However, consistent with
industry practice, we capitalize certain aircraft-related major maintenance costs on one of our
aircraft fleet types and amortize these costs over their estimated service lives.

The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the
determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events.
Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of
aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are
necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation
may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft
and other equipment. For our aircraft, we typically assign no residual value due to the
utilization of these assets in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end
of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a
period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated
lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in
future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations. Historically, gains
and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically aggregating less than $10
million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in
business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other
factors beyond our control.

Table of Contents   

Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate
volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft
based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft
types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire
these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks
that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. Aircraft
purchases (primarily aircraft in passenger configuration) that have not been placed in service
totaled $101 million at May 31, 2010 and $130 million at May 31, 2009. We plan to modify these
assets in the future and place them into operations.

The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows
do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate
integrated transportation networks and, accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets
are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment.
Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall
network rather than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain
long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating
costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held
for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision
is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations
for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of
these aircraft. Such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.

There were no material property and equipment impairment charges recognized in 2010 or 2008.
However, during 2009, we recorded $202 million in property and equipment impairment charges. These
charges were primarily related to our decision to permanently remove from service certain aircraft,
along with certain excess aircraft engines, at FedEx Express.

LEASES . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities and equipment.
Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end
of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in  Contractual Cash Obligations  and Note 6 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements, at May 31, 2010 we had approximately $14
billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The
weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2010 was
approximately six years.

The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet
under current U.S. accounting rules. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a
capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair
value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes
ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about
whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent
for the owner-lessor or, in substance, the owner of the asset during the construction period. We
believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including
obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these
evaluations.

GOODWILL . We have $2.2 billion of goodwill in our balance sheet from our acquisitions,
representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. Several
factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of
the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired entity.

-68- 

Table of Contents   

Our annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates
and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value is estimated using
standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach) incorporating market
participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins,
discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly
affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other
assumptions could materially affect these estimates. We perform our annual impairment tests in the
fourth quarter unless circumstances indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test.

In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets conducted
in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $18 million for the remaining
value of goodwill attributable to our FedEx National LTL reporting unit. Beginning in 2009, the
U.S. recession had a significant negative impact on the LTL industry resulting in volume declines,
yield pressures and operating losses. These difficult conditions have continued in 2010 and the
resulting excess capacity and competitive pricing environment has continued to negatively impact
our FedEx National LTL reporting unit. Given these market conditions and our forecast for this
business, we concluded the remaining goodwill was not recoverable.

Our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include our FedEx Express, FedEx
Freight (excluding FedEx National LTL) and FedEx Office reporting units. We evaluated these
remaining reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2010. The estimated fair value of each of
these reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values in 2010. Although we recorded
goodwill impairment charges associated with our FedEx Office reporting unit in 2009 and 2008,
better-than-expected results in 2010, combined with an improved long-term outlook, drove an
increase in the valuation of this reporting unit. As a result, no additional testing or impairment
charges were necessary and we do not believe that any of these reporting units are at risk.

FEDEX OFFICE GOODWILL . During 2009 and 2008, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.7 billion for
impairment of the Kinko s trade name and the goodwill recorded as a result of the FedEx Office
acquisition. In 2008, we recorded a charge of $891 million predominantly related to a $515 million
impairment of the Kinko s trade name and a $367 million impairment of goodwill. This charge was a
result of the decision to phase out the use of the Kinko s trade name and reduced profitability at
FedEx Office over the forecast period. In 2009, despite several actions taken to reduce FedEx
Office s cost structure and the initiation of an internal reorganization designed to improve
revenue-generating capabilities and reduce costs, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $810
million. This charge was a result of reduced profitability at FedEx Office over the forecast
period. Additional discussion of the key assumptions related to these charges is included in Note
3 to our consolidated financial statements.

FEDEX NATIONAL LTL GOODWILL . In 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million at
our FedEx National LTL reporting unit. This charge was a result of reduced revenues and increased
operating losses due to the negative impact of the U.S. recession. The forecast used in the
valuation assumed operating losses would continue in the near-term due to the weak economic
conditions and excess capacity in the industry which had a significant negative impact on the
valuation of the FedEx National LTL reporting unit. Additional discussion of the key assumptions
related to these charges is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.

CONTINGENCIES  

We are subject to various loss contingencies, including tax proceedings and litigation, in
connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their
measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further,
additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their
outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for
these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment
is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a
liability, if any. Our material pending loss contingencies are described in Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any,
of individual matters or groups of matters not specifically described in Note 16 is not expected to
be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following
describes our method and associated processes for evaluating these matters.

-69- 

Table of Contents   

TAX CONTINGENCIES . We are subject to income and operating tax rules of the U.S., and its states
and municipalities, and of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining income tax provisions, as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances
and related deferred tax valuation allowances, if necessary, due to the complexity of these rules
and their interaction with one another. We account for income taxes by recording both current
taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our provision for income taxes is based on
domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate,
applied to taxable income, reduced by applicable tax credits.

We account for operating taxes based on multi-state, local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rules in
those areas in which we operate. Provisions for operating taxes are estimated based upon these
rules, asset acquisitions and disposals, historical spend and other variables. These provisions
are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factors.

Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many
jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax contingencies are impacted by several factors,
including tax audits, appeals, litigation, changes in tax laws and other rules, and their
interpretations, and changes in our business, among other things, in the various federal, state,
local and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We regularly assess the potential impact
of these factors for the current and prior years to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions.
We continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust our tax
positions, including the current and deferred tax liabilities, in the period in which the facts
that give rise to a revision become known. In addition, management considers the advice of third
parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available
evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires
us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such
amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to
management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in
facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit
activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an increase to the related provision.

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable,
penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and
accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented
as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated
within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in
the caption  Other liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets.

We measure and record operating tax contingency accruals in accordance with accounting guidance for
contingencies. As discussed below, this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from a
contingency, such as a tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

-70- 

Table of Contents   

OTHER CONTINGENCIES . Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to
other legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters,
employment-related claims and FedEx Ground s owner-operators. Accounting guidance for
contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other
legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to
occur) that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This
guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management s judgment, a
material loss is reasonably possible or probable of occurring.

Our legal department maintains thorough processes to identify, evaluate and monitor the status of
litigation and other loss contingencies as they arise and develop. Management has regular,
comprehensive litigation and contingency reviews, including updates from internal and external
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these
contingencies. In determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we
evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome or settlement
and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Events may arise that were
not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially
from our previously estimated liability.

RISK FACTORS 

Our financial and operating results are subject to many risks and uncertainties, as described
below.

Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.   The FedEx brand
name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely
recognized, trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most
important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers and the
general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate
governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and
marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse
publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors or agents
could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss
of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources
to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.

Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential
changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so.   If we are unable to continue to
maintain good relationships with our employees and prevent labor organizations from organizing
groups of our employees, our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational
flexibility could be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions,
other than the pilots of FedEx Express, all of our U.S. employees have thus far chosen not to
unionize. The U.S. Congress is considering adopting changes in labor laws, however, that would
make it easier for unions to organize small units of our employees. For example, in May 2009, the
U.S. House of Representatives passed the FAA Reauthorization Act, which includes a provision that
would remove most FedEx Express employees from the purview of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as
amended (the  RLA ). For additional discussion of the RLA, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K under the caption  Regulation.  This labor provision was not in the version of
the bill passed in March 2010 by the U.S. Senate. Should the House version of the FAA
Reauthorization Act (or a similar bill removing FedEx Express from RLA jurisdiction) be passed by
the entire Congress and signed into law by the President, it could expose our customers to the type
of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent   local work stoppages in key areas
that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our
global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced
shipping options and ready access to global markets. There is also the possibility that the U.S.
Congress could pass other labor legislation, such as the currently proposed Employee Free Choice
Act (the  EFCA ) (also called  card-check legislation ), that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, whose employees are
governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the  NLRA ). The EFCA would
amend the NLRA to substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization   for example, by
eliminating employees  absolute right to a secret ballot vote in union elections. The EFCA could
also require imposition of an arbitrated initial contract that could include pay, benefit and work
rules that could adversely impact employers. Finally, changes to federal or state laws governing employee
classification could impact the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent
contractors.

We rely heavily on technology to operate our transportation and business networks, and any
disruption to our technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our operations and our
reputation among customers.   Our ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively
depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network, including our
ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers. Any disruption to the
Internet or our technology infrastructure, including those impacting our computer systems and Web
site, could adversely impact our customer service and our volumes and revenues and result in
increased costs. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives
and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruptions
and the resulting adverse effect on our operations and financial results.

Our transportation businesses may be impacted by the price and availability of fuel.   We must
purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and
availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. To date, we have been mostly
successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel
surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we
are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or
some other reason, fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to
offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers,
especially in the U.S. domestic market, away from our higher-yielding express services to our
lower-yielding ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. These
effects were evident in the first quarter of 2009, as fuel prices reached all-time highs. In
addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate
our transportation networks.

Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital expenditures based upon projected
volume levels.   We make significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, package handling
facilities, sort equipment, copy equipment and other assets to support our transportation and
business networks. We also make significant investments to rebrand, integrate and grow the
companies that we acquire. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors,
including our anticipated volume growth. For example, we must make commitments to purchase or
modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We must predict volume levels and
fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our
projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes.
Overcapacity could lead to asset dispositions or write-downs and undercapacity could negatively
impact service levels. For example, during 2009, as a result of excess aircraft capacity at FedEx
Express, we permanently removed certain aircraft and certain excess aircraft engines from service and
thus recorded a charge of $199 million.

We face intense competition, especially in the LTL freight industry.   The transportation and
business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service,
especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. Some of our competitors have more
financial resources than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which
enables them to raise capital more easily. We believe we compete effectively with these companies
  for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, our competitors
determine the charges for their services, and weak economic conditions have led to excess capacity
and a very competitive pricing environment, especially in the LTL freight industry. As a result,
the FedEx Freight segment experienced yield declines and operating losses during 2009 and 2010. An
irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices
(including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow our
market share. In addition, maintaining a broad portfolio of services is important to keeping and
attracting customers. While we believe we compete effectively through our current service offerings, if our competitors offer a broader range of services or more
effectively bundle their services, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market
share.

If we do not effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses, our financial
results and reputation may suffer.   Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and
profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and to realize
the benefits we expect when we make those acquisitions. In furtherance of this strategy, during
2007 we acquired the LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines (renamed FedEx National LTL) and
made strategic acquisitions in China, the United Kingdom and India. During 2004, we acquired
Kinko s, Inc. (now known as FedEx Office). While we expect our past and future acquisitions to
enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our long-term profitability, there can be no
assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at
all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired businesses,
including their goodwill or other intangible assets. As an example, during 2008, 2009 and 2010, we
recorded aggregate charges of $1.8 billion for impairment of the value of the Kinko s trade name
and portions of the goodwill recorded as a result of the FedEx Office and FedEx National LTL
acquisitions. These charges were necessary, among other reasons, because the recent and forecasted
financial performance of those companies did not meet our original expectations as a result of weak
economic conditions.

FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations,
and the status of these owner-operators as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being
challenged.   FedEx Ground s use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the
ground delivery business and its customers, as evidenced by the strong growth of this business
segment. We are involved in numerous lawsuits (including many that have been certified as class
actions) and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the company s
owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than independent
contractors. We expect to incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of
FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors. We believe that FedEx Ground s
owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an
employer of the drivers of the company s independent contractors. However, adverse determinations
in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contractors and their drivers to
the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in
employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could result in changes
to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators. If FedEx Ground is
compelled to convert its independent contractors to employees, labor organizations could more
easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur
significant capital outlays.

Increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express.  
As a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, governments around the world
are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase
operating costs for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. For example, in
July 2007, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration issued to us a Full All-Cargo Aircraft
Operator Standard Security Plan, which contained many new and enhanced security requirements.
These requirements are not static, but will change periodically as the result of regulatory and
legislative requirements, and to respond to evolving threats. Until these requirements are
adopted, we cannot determine the effect that these new rules will have on our cost structure or our
operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that these rules or other future security
requirements could impose material costs on us.

The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may impact our air operations.   Our extensive
air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the
approval of the Department of Transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement between
the United States and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign
governments to provide specific flights and services. Regulatory actions affecting global aviation
rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets could
impair our ability to operate our air network.

We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such
change.   Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to
significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions. For
example, during 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union
Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision,
all FedEx Express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the European Union will be
covered by the ETS requirements beginning in 2012, and each year we will be required to submit
emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. In
addition, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed and the Senate continues to consider a bill
that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible
in the relatively near future. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft
or diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express.
These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital
costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the
timing, scope and extent of such regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost
structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could impose
material costs on us. Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse
publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and
transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services,
especially our air express services. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations
and our susceptibility to global macro-economic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the
physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in world
ecosystems.

We will soon be negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents
the pilots of FedEx Express.   FedEx Express pilots are employed under a collective bargaining
agreement that becomes amendable on October 31, 2010. In accordance with applicable labor law, we
will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots. We cannot
predict the outcome of these negotiations. The terms of any new collective bargaining agreement
could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to compete with other providers
of express delivery services. On the other hand, if we are unable to reach agreement on a new
collective bargaining agreement, we may be subject to a strike or work stoppages by our pilots,
subject to the requirements of the RLA. These actions could have a negative impact on our ability
to operate our express transportation network and ultimately cause us to lose customers.

We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:  

increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates
for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits; 

the impact of any international conflicts or terrorist activities on the United States and
global economies in general, the transportation industry or us in particular, and what effects
these events will have on our costs or the demand for our services; 

any impacts on our businesses resulting from new domestic or international government laws
and regulation; 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, Canadian
dollar, British pound and Japanese yen, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency
sales prices; 

market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives; 

any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action litigation,
such as wage-and-hour and discrimination and retaliation claims, and any other legal
proceedings; 

the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and
our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information technology
redundancy and complexity throughout the organization; 

adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and
hurricanes, which can disrupt our electrical service, damage our property, disrupt our
operations, increase our fuel costs and adversely affect our shipment levels; 

widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public
health crisis; and 

availability of financing on terms acceptable to us and our ability to maintain our current
credit ratings, especially given the capital intensity of our operations.

We are directly affected by the state of the economy.   While the global, or macro-economic, risks
listed above apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry
is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity, such as the recent
global recession. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly
tied to the purchase and production of goods   key macro-economic measurements. When individuals
and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods. In addition, we have a
relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume
levels. Moreover, as we grow our international business, we are increasingly affected by the
health of the global economy. As a result, the recent global recession has had a
disproportionately negative impact on us and our recent financial results.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL 
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things,
defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated
information systems for processing transactions and a properly staffed, professional internal audit
department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting and actions are taken to correct all identified deficiencies. Our procedures
for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee
and our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.

Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, the end of our fiscal year.
Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of May 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, has been
audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited
the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst
  Young LLP s report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting is included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
FedEx Corporation

We have audited FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010,
based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). FedEx Corporation s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, FedEx Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2010 and
2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders  investment and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2010
of FedEx Corporation and our report dated July 15, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
FedEx Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31,
2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders 
investment and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
May 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of FedEx Corporation at May 31, 2010 and 2009, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended May 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2008 the Company adopted the
measurement date provisions originally issued in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
158,  Employer s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans  
An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),  (codified in FASB Accounting Standards
Codification 715, Compensation   Retirement Benefits).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 15, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation,
e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently
and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are
Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the world s largest express transportation company;
FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading provider of small-package ground
delivery services; and the FedEx Freight LTL Group, which comprises the FedEx Freight and FedEx
National LTL businesses of FedEx Freight Corporation, a leading U.S. provider of
less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These companies represent our major service lines
and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ), form the core of our reportable
segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology and customer
service support to our transportation segments. In addition, the FedEx Services segment provides
customers with retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx
Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ).

FISCAL YEARS . Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended
May 31, 2010 or ended May 31 of the year referenced.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx
and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION . We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments for our transportation
businesses and upon completion of services for our business services, logistics and trade services
businesses. Certain of our transportation services are provided with the use of independent
contractors. FedEx is the principal to the transaction in most instances and in those cases
revenue from these transactions is recognized on a gross basis. Costs associated with independent
contractor settlements are recognized as incurred and included in the caption  Purchased
transportation  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For shipments in transit,
revenue is recorded based on the percentage of service completed at the balance sheet date.
Estimates for future billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable are recognized at the
time of shipment for money-back service guarantees and billing corrections. Delivery costs are
accrued as incurred.

Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain transportation businesses, such as FedEx
SmartPost, engage in some transactions wherein they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions
is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges,
including transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions, and taxes and duties.

Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes, such as sales tax, assessed by
governmental authorities. We present these revenues net of tax.

CREDIT RISK.  We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business
services without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially
mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of
customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most of our services. Allowances for
potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current
economic factors on the composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit losses have been
within management s expectations.

ADVERTISING.  Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other
operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were $374 million in 2010, $379 million in
2009 and $445 million in 2008.

-84- 

Table of Contents   

CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term,
interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is
stated at cost, which approximates market value.

SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL.  Spare parts (principally aircraft related) are reported at
weighted-average cost. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts expected to be on
hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the
estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. Additionally, allowances for
obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete. These
allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change. Supplies and fuel are
reported at cost on a first-in, first-out basis.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Expenditures for major additions, improvements, flight equipment
modifications and certain equipment overhaul costs are capitalized when such costs are determined
to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft-related major
maintenance costs on one of our aircraft fleet types, which are capitalized as incurred and
amortized over their estimated service lives. We capitalize certain direct internal and external
costs associated with the development of internal-use software. Gains and losses on sales of
property used in operations are classified within operating expenses.

For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment
on a straight-line basis over the asset s service life or related lease term, if shorter. For
income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable. The
depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in
millions):

Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of
aircraft costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 18 years. We periodically
evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and
equipment. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values. Such
changes did not materially affect depreciation expense in any period presented. Depreciation
expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $1.9
billion in 2010, $1.8 billion in 2009 and $1.8 billion in 2008. Depreciation and amortization
expense includes amortization of assets under capital lease.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST . Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of
aircraft, including purchase deposits, construction of certain facilities, and development of
certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use is capitalized and included
in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $80
million in 2010, $71 million in 2009 and $50 million in 2008.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances
indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and
used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is
made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between
the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values,
discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of
are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.
We operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our
operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level, for our
analysis of impairment.

There were no material property and equipment impairment charges recognized in 2010 or 2008.
During 2009, we recorded $202 million in property and equipment impairment charges. These charges
were primarily related to our decision to permanently remove from service certain aircraft, along
with certain excess aircraft engines, at FedEx Express.

GOODWILL.  Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise
to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and
the existing workforce of the acquired entity. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including
attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market
approach incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue
growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Fair value
determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances
otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  Intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, technology
assets and contract-based intangibles acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are
amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or an
accelerated basis depending upon the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Our defined benefit plans are measured using
actuarial techniques that reflect management s assumptions for discount rate, expected long-term
investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee
turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate (which is
required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as
of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical
portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match
our expected benefit payments in future years. A calculated-value method is employed for purposes
of determining the expected return on the plan asset component of net periodic pension cost for our
qualified U.S. pension plans.

The accounting guidance related to employers  accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in other comprehensive
income ( OCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. Additionally,
the guidance requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the
plan sponsor s year end.

At May 31, 2010, we recorded a decrease to equity through OCI of $1.0 billion (net of tax) based
primarily on mark-to-market adjustments related to increases in our projected benefit obligation
due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liability at May 31, 2010. At May 31,
2009, we recorded a decrease of $1.2 billion based primarily on mark-to-market
adjustments related to unrealized losses in our pension plan assets during 2009.

INCOME TAXES . Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred
taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.

Table of Contents   

We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available
evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires
us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest
amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently
difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various
possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new
information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including,
but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled
issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could
result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable,
penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and
accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented
as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated
within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in
the caption  Other liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS . We are self-insured for workers  compensation claims, vehicle accidents
and general liabilities, benefits paid under employee healthcare programs and long-term disability
benefits. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of claims,
which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers  compensation claims, vehicle and
general liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability are included in accrued
expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk.
Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk
tolerance and premium expense.

LEASES . We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under capital and operating
leases. The commencement date of all leases is the earlier of the date we become legally obligated
to make rent payments or the date we may exercise control over the use of the property. In
addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases provide for contingent rentals based on
equipment usage principally related to aircraft leases at FedEx Express and copier usage at FedEx
Office. Rent expense associated with contingent rentals is recorded as incurred. Certain of our
leases contain fluctuating or escalating payments and rent holiday periods. The related rent
expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The cumulative excess of rent
payments over rent expense is accounted for as a deferred lease asset and recorded in
 Other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative excess of rent
expense over rent payments is accounted for as a deferred lease obligation. Leasehold improvements
associated with assets utilized under capital or operating leases are amortized over the shorter of
the asset s useful life or the lease term.

DEFERRED GAINS . Gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are
deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense.
Substantially all of these deferred gains are related to aircraft transactions.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION . Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local
currencies as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred
income taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within common stockholders 
investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on
transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in the caption
 Other, net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each
period presented. Cumulative net foreign currency translation gains in accumulated other
comprehensive income were $30 million at May 31, 2010, $56 million at May 31, 2009 and $167 million
at May 31, 2008.

EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots of FedEx Express, which represent a
small number of FedEx Express total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining agreement
that will become amendable during the second quarter of 2011. In accordance with applicable labor
law, we will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots. We
cannot estimate the financial impact, if any, the results of these negotiations may have on our
future results of operations.

Table of Contents   

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION . We recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards under the
provisions of the accounting guidance related to share-based payments. This guidance requires
recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE . On June 7, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly
dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2010 to stockholders
of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2010. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject
to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an
annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.

USE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes
its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other
information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are
recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the
period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the
estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts
estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive
accruals; tax liabilities; accounts receivable allowances; obsolescence of spare parts; contingent
liabilities; loss contingencies, such as litigation and other claims; and impairment assessments on
long-lived assets (including goodwill).

NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and
the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance,
which has been adopted by us, is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.

On June 1, 2008, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) on fair value measurements, which provides a common definition of fair value,
establishes a uniform framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about
fair value measurements. On June 1, 2009, we implemented the previously deferred provisions of
this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as required. The
adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on business combinations and the
accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority
interests). This guidance significantly changed the accounting for and reporting of business
combination transactions, including noncontrolling interests. For example, the acquiring entity is
now required to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
transaction, and the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs is now required. This
guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009 and had no material impact on our financial
statements because we have not had any significant business combinations since that date.

In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on employers  disclosures about
postretirement benefit plan assets. This guidance provides objectives that an employer should
consider when providing detailed disclosures about assets of a defined benefit pension or other
postretirement plan, including disclosures about investment policies and strategies, categories of
plan assets, significant concentrations of risk and the inputs and valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of plan assets. This guidance became effective for our 2010 Annual Report.
See Note 11 for related disclosures.

In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to interim disclosures about the
fair value of financial instruments. This guidance requires disclosures about the fair value of
financial instruments for interim reporting periods in addition to annual reporting periods and
became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.

NOTE 3: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL.  The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment and
changes therein are as follows (in millions):

(1)  
       
     Primarily currency translation adjustments. 

(2)  
       
     Transfer of goodwill related to the merger of Caribbean Transportation Services into FedEx Express effective June 1, 2009. 

In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter
of 2010, we recorded a charge of $18 million for impairment of the value of the remaining goodwill
at our FedEx National LTL reporting unit. Beginning in 2009, the U.S. recession had a significant
negative impact on the LTL industry, resulting in volume declines, yield pressures and operating
losses. These difficult conditions continued in 2010 and the resulting excess capacity and
competitive pricing environment had a significant negative impact on our FedEx National LTL
reporting unit. Given these market conditions, our forecast for this business did not support the
recoverability of the remaining goodwill attributable to our FedEx National LTL reporting unit.

We evaluated our remaining reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2010, and the estimated
fair value of each of our other reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values in
2010. Although we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with our FedEx Office reporting
unit in 2009 and 2008, better-than-expected results in 2010 combined with an improved long-term
outlook drove an improvement in the valuation of this reporting unit. As a result, no additional
testing or impairment charges were necessary and we do not believe that any of these reporting
units are at risk.

Goodwill Impairment Charges   2009 

FEDEX OFFICE.  During 2009, in response to the lower revenues and continued operating losses at
FedEx Office resulting from the U.S. recession, the company initiated an internal reorganization
designed to improve revenue-generating capabilities and reduce costs. This reorganization resulted
in actions that included headcount reductions, domestic store closures and the termination of
operations in some international locations. In addition, we substantially curtailed future network
expansion in light of weak economic conditions.

In connection with our annual impairment testing in 2009, the valuation methodology to estimate the
fair value of the FedEx Office reporting unit was based primarily on an income approach that
considered market participant assumptions to estimate fair value. Key assumptions considered were
the revenue and operating income forecast, the assessed growth rate in the periods beyond the
detailed forecast period, and the discount rate.

-89- 

Table of Contents   

For 2009, our discount rate of 12.0% represented our estimated weighted-average cost of
capital ( WACC ) of the FedEx Office reporting unit adjusted for company-specific risk premium to
account for the estimated uncertainty associated with our future cash flows. The development of
the WACC used in our estimate of fair value considered the current market conditions for the
equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate, the size and industry of the FedEx Office
reporting unit, and the risks related to the forecast of future revenues and profitability of the
FedEx Office reporting unit.

Upon completion of the impairment test, we concluded that the recorded goodwill was impaired and
recorded an impairment charge of $810 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. The goodwill
impairment charge is included in 2009 operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. This charge was included in the results of the FedEx Services segment and
was not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the core
performance of those businesses.

FEDEX NATIONAL LTL.  In 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million at our FedEx
National LTL unit. This charge was a result of reduced revenues and increased operating losses due
to the negative impact of the U.S. recession.

The valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of the FedEx National LTL reporting unit was
based primarily on a market approach (revenue multiples and/or earnings multiples) that considered
market participant assumptions. We believe use of the market approach for FedEx National LTL was
appropriate due to the forecast risk associated with the projections used under the income
approach, particularly in the outer years of the forecast period (as described below). Further,
there are directly comparable companies to the FedEx National LTL reporting unit for consideration
under the market approach. The income approach also was incorporated into the impairment test to
ensure the reasonableness of our conclusions under the market approach. Key assumptions considered
were the revenue, operating income and capital expenditure forecasts and market participant
assumptions on multiples related to revenue and earnings forecasts.

The forecast used in the valuation assumed operating losses would continue in the near-term due to
weak economic conditions and excess capacity in the industry. However, the long-term outlook
assumed that this excess capacity would exit the market. This assumption drove significant volume
and yield improvement into the FedEx National LTL reporting unit in future periods. The decision
to include an assumption related to the elimination of excess capacity from the market and the
associated cash flows was significant to the valuation and reflected management s outlook on the
industry for future periods as of the valuation date.

Goodwill Impairment Charges   2008 

FEDEX OFFICE.  During 2008, several developments and strategic decisions occurred at FedEx Office,
including a reorganization of FedEx Office into the FedEx Services segment, a reorganization of
senior management, as well as a decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name over the
next several years. We also began implementing revenue growth and cost management plans to improve
financial performance and pursuing a more disciplined approach to the long-term expansion of the
retail network, reducing the overall level of expansion.

Upon completion of the impairment test, these factors, combined with forecasted losses resulted in
our conclusion that the recorded goodwill was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $367
million during the fourth quarter of 2008. The goodwill impairment charge is included in 2008
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. This charge was included
in the results of the FedEx Services segment and was not allocated to our transportation segments,
as the charge was unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

The valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of the FedEx Office reporting unit was based
primarily on an income approach that considered market participant assumptions to estimate fair
value. Key assumptions considered were the revenue and operating income forecast, the assessed
growth rate in the periods beyond the detailed forecast period, and the discount rate.

-90- 

Table of Contents   

In performing our annual impairment test, the most significant assumption used to estimate the fair
value of the FedEx Office reporting unit was the discount rate. We used a discount rate of 12.5%,
representing the estimated WACC of the FedEx Office reporting unit.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  The components of our identifiable intangible assets were as follows (in
millions):

Prior to 2008, we had an indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Kinko s trade
name. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we made the decision to change the name of FedEx Kinko s
to FedEx Office and rebrand our retail locations over the next several years. This change
converted this asset to a finite life asset and resulted in an impairment charge of $515 million.
We estimated the fair value of this intangible asset based on an income approach using the
relief-from-royalty method. This change resulted in a remaining trade name balance of $52 million,
which we began amortizing in the fourth quarter of 2008 on an accelerated basis, and which will be
fully amortized by May 2011. The trade name impairment charge is included in 2008 operating
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The charge was included in the
results of the FedEx Services segment and was not allocated to our transportation segments, as the
charge was unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $51 million in 2010, $73 million in 2009 and $60
million in 2008. Estimated amortization expense is expected to be $33 million in 2011 and
immaterial in subsequent years.

NOTE 4: SELECTED CURRENT LIABILITIES

The components of selected current liability captions were as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents   

NOTE 5: LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

The components of long-term debt (net of discounts), along with maturity dates for the years
subsequent to May 31, 2010, are as follows (in millions):

Interest on our fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Long-term debt, exclusive of capital
leases, had carrying values of $1.8 billion compared with
estimated fair values of $2.1 billion
at May 31, 2010, and $2.3 billion compared with
estimated fair values of $2.4 billion at May 31,
2009. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices or on the current
rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.

We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt
securities and common stock.

In January 2009, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration
statement, comprised of fixed-rate notes totaling $250 million due in January 2014 and $750 million
due in January 2019. The fixed-rate notes due in January 2014 bear interest at an annual rate of
7.375%, payable semi-annually, and the fixed-rate notes due in January 2019 bear interest at an
annual rate of 8.00%, payable semi-annually. During 2010, we repaid our $500 million 5.50% notes
that matured on August 15, 2009 using cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds of our
January 2009 $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering.

A $1 billion revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations and other cash flow
needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The revolving credit agreement
expires in July 2012. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a
leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus
six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus
total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 0.7 to 1.0. Our leverage ratio of
adjusted debt to capital was 0.5 at May 31, 2010. We are in compliance with this and all other
restrictive covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants to affect
our operations, including our liquidity or borrowing capacity. As of May 31, 2010, no commercial
paper was outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available
for future borrowings.

We issue other financial instruments in the normal course of business to support our operations,
including letters of credit. We had a total of $553 million in letters of credit outstanding at
May 31, 2010, with $94 million unused under our primary $500 million letter of credit facility.
These instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the
normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments
are reflected in our balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is
reflected for the letters of credit.

Table of Contents   

Our capital lease obligations include leases for aircraft and facilities. Our facility leases
include leases that guarantee the repayment of certain special facility revenue bonds that have
been issued by municipalities primarily to finance the acquisition and construction of various
airport facilities and equipment. These bonds require interest payments at least annually, with
principal payments due at the end of the related lease agreement.

NOTE 6: LEASES

We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities, retail locations and equipment under capital and
operating leases that expire at various dates through 2040. We leased 12% of our total aircraft
fleet under capital or operating leases as of May 31, 2010 as compared to 13% as of May 31, 2009.
A portion of our supplemental aircraft are leased by us under agreements that provide for
cancellation upon 30 days  notice. Our leased facilities include national, regional and
metropolitan sorting facilities, retail facilities and administrative buildings.

The components of property and equipment recorded under capital leases were as follows (in
millions):

Rent
expense under operating leases for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

A summary of future minimum lease payments under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases
with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2010 is as follows (in
millions):

The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2010 was
approximately six years. While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use
of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease
agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.

FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay
principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not
direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.

We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft. The
lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These
leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities. We are not the primary
beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the
inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option
or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in
increases in the value of the aircraft. As such, we are not required to consolidate the entity as
the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary of
future minimum lease payments shown above.

NOTE 7: PREFERRED STOCK

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up
to 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The stock is issuable in series, which may vary as to
certain rights and preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2010, none of these shares had
been issued.

NOTE 8: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

-94- 

Table of Contents   

We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock.

STOCK OPTIONS . Under the provisions of our incentive stock plans, key employees and non-employee
directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than
its fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years.
Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to four years, with 83% of our options vesting
ratably over four years. Compensation expense
associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the award.

RESTRICTED STOCK.  Under the terms of our incentive stock plans, restricted shares of our common
stock are awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year
period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. The terms of our restricted
stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee s retirement. Compensation expense
associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
remaining service or vesting period.

VALUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS . We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair
value of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based on the stock price of the
award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the  Salaries and employee benefits  caption in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option,
stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Many of these assumptions
are judgmental and highly sensitive. Following is a table of the weighted-average Black-Scholes
value of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions), and the
key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for the options granted during
the years ended May 31, and then a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the
assumptions used in the valuation model:

Expected Lives.  This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain
outstanding. Generally, options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. We examine actual stock
option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. An increase in the expected term
will increase compensation expense.

Expected Volatility.  Actual changes in the market value of our stock are used to calculate the
volatility assumption. We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past
period equal to the expected life of the options to determine volatility. An increase in the
expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Risk-Free Interest Rate.  This is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a
term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will
increase compensation expense.

Dividend Yield.  This is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the
option. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

As of May 31, 2010, there was $139 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of
estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. This
compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
weighted-average vesting period of approximately three years.

Total shares outstanding or available for grant related to equity compensation at May 31, 2010
represented 8% of the total outstanding common and equity compensation shares and equity
compensation shares available for grant.

Pretax earnings of foreign operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $555 million, $106 million and
$803 million, respectively, which represents only a portion of total results associated with
international shipments.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the
years ended May 31 was as follows:

Our 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were significantly impacted by goodwill impairment charges
related to the FedEx Office acquisition, which are not deductible for income tax purposes.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 31 were as follows (in
millions):

The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows
(in millions):

We have $394 million of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions and $489
million of state operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowances primarily represent amounts
reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which expire over varying periods
starting in 2011. As a result of this and other factors, we believe that a substantial portion of
these deferred tax assets may not be realized.

Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $325 million in 2010 and $191 million
in 2009. We have not recognized deferred taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Upon
distribution, in the form of dividends or otherwise, these unremitted earnings would be subject to
U.S. federal income tax. Unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion
of the U.S. tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax
liability is not practicable.

Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions totaled $82 million at May 31, 2010 and $72
million at May 31, 2009, including $67 million at May 31, 2010 and $59 million at May 31, 2009
associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax
rate. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if
applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued
interest and penalties was $20 million on May 31, 2010 and $19 million on May 31, 2009. Total
interest and penalties included in our consolidated statements of income is immaterial.

We file income tax returns in the U.S., various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and various
foreign jurisdictions. During 2010, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) commenced its audit of
our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. We are no longer
subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for years through 2006 except for specific U.S.
federal income tax positions that are in various stages of appeal and/or litigation. No resolution
date can be reasonably estimated at this time for these appeals and litigation, but their
resolution is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We
are also subject to ongoing audits in state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions throughout the
world.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in
millions):

Included in the May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009 balances are $9 million and $7 million, respectively,
of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility or income inclusion is certain but for which
there may be uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility or income inclusion. It is
difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes
may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals or litigation in state, local, federal
and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between the U.S. and
foreign tax authorities. Our liability for uncertain tax positions includes no matters that are
individually material to us. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect
to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months,
but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible changes cannot be made. However, we do not
expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax positions will be material.

NOTE 11: RETIREMENT PLANS

We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs
include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare
plans. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous
assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future
salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These assumptions most
significantly impact our U.S. domestic pension plans.

We made significant changes to our retirement plans during 2008 and 2009. Beginning January 1,
2008, we increased the annual company-matching contribution under the largest of our 401(k) plans
covering most employees from a maximum of $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of eligible compensation.
Employees not participating in the 401(k) plan as of January 1, 2008 were automatically enrolled at
3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible pay effective March 1, 2008. As a
temporary cost-control measure, we suspended 401(k) company-matching contributions effective
February 1, 2009. We reinstated these contributions at 50% of previous levels for most employees
effective January 1, 2010.

Table of Contents   

Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a
traditional pension benefit formula (based on average earnings and years of service) were capped
for most employees, and those benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Effective June 1,
2008, future pension benefits for most employees began to be accrued under a cash balance formula
we call the Portable Pension Account. These changes did not affect the benefits of previously
retired and terminated vested participants. In addition, these pension plans were modified to
accelerate vesting from five years to three years for most participants.

Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a
notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service,
and interest on the notional account balance. Under the tax-qualified plans, the pension benefit
is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. An
employee s pay credits are determined each year under a graded formula that combines age with years
of service for points. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S.
Treasury index.

The accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance
sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and
the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits. The funded status is measured as the difference between the
fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) of the plan. At May
31, 2010, under the provisions of this guidance, we recorded a decrease to equity of $1 billion
(net of tax) to reflect unrealized actuarial losses during 2010. At May 31, 2009, we recorded a decrease to equity of $1.2 billion (net of tax) attributable to our plans.

Additionally, the accounting guidance requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities
to coincide with the plan sponsor s year end. On June 1, 2008, we made our transition election for
the measurement date provision using the two-measurement approach. Under this approach, we
completed two actuarial measurements, one at February 29, 2008 and the other at June 1, 2008. This
approach required us to record the net periodic benefit cost for the transition period from March
1, 2008 through May 31, 2008 as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings ($44 million, net of
tax) and actuarial gains and losses for the period (a gain of $369 million, net of tax) as an
adjustment to the opening balance of AOCI.

A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

PENSION PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at
least one year of service. We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering
certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international
employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on
final earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision
coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. U.S. employees covered by the
principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent,
continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1,
1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.
Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer
cost, which has been reached and, therefore, these benefits are not subject to additional future
inflation.

Table of Contents   

PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS.  Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to
measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Beginning in 2009, we use a measurement date of May 31 for our pension and postretirement
healthcare plans. Prior to 2009, our measurement date was February 28 (February 29 in 2008).
Management reviews the assumptions used to measure pension costs on an annual basis. Economic and
market conditions at the measurement date impact these assumptions from year to year and it is
reasonably possible that material changes in pension cost may be experienced in the future.
Additional information about our pension plans can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis in this Annual Report.

Actuarial gains or losses are generated for changes in assumptions and to the extent that actual
results differ from those assumed. These actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the
remaining average service lives of our active employees if they exceed a corridor amount in the
aggregate.

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public
and private equity portfolios, together with public and private fixed-income portfolios, to earn a
long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our pension plan assets are
invested primarily in listed securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in
FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment
managers. Our largest holding classes, Corporate Fixed Income Securities and U.S. Large Cap
Equities, are indexed to an S P 500 fund. Accordingly, we do not have any significant
concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to
realize investment returns in excess of market indices. As part of our strategy to manage future
pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven
investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities to better align plan
assets with liabilities. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative
financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns and manage exposure to
market risk. In all cases, our investment managers are prohibited from using derivatives for
speculative purposes and are not permitted to use derivatives to leverage a portfolio.

The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that
materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of
earnings on plan assets. Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension
assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this
assumption:

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we
can employ with our pension plan assets; 

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the
expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to
earn over time; and 

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to
achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in
indexed funds. 

We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.

To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by
third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These
studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation
of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate
probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The studies performed or updated
supported the reasonableness of our expected rate of return of 8.0% for 2010 and 8.5% for 2009 and
2008. Our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets remains at 8.0% for 2011. For the
15-year period ended May 31, 2010, our actual returns were 7.9%.

-101- 

Table of Contents   

Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan
assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value method to determine the value of plan
assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and
decreases) by amortizing certain actuarial gains or losses over a period no longer than four years.
Another method used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date.
The calculated-value method significantly mitigated the impact of asset value declines in the
determination of our 2010 pension expense, reducing our 2010 expense by approximately $135 million.
For purposes of valuing plan assets for determining 2011 pension expense, the calculated-value method will result in the same value as the market value, as it did in 2009.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair
value:

Cash and cash equivalents . These investments include cash equivalents valued using exchange rates provided
by an industry pricing vendor and commingled funds valued using the net asset value. These investments also
include cash. 

Domestic and international equities . These investments are valued at the closing price or last trade
reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. In addition, commingled funds are
valued using the net asset value. 

Private equity . The valuation of these investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of
quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments are
valued based upon recommendations of our investment managers incorporating factors such as contributions and
distributions, market transactions, market comparables and performance multiples. 

Fixed income . The fair values of Corporate, U.S. government securities and other fixed income securities
are estimated by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics.

The table above provides the ABO, PBO, fair value of plan assets and funded status of our plans on
an aggregated basis. The following table presents our plans on a disaggregated basis to show those
plans (as a group) whose assets did not exceed their liabilities. The increase in plans included
in the table in 2010 was driven by the decrease in our discount rate at our May 31, 2010
measurement date, which increased the number of plans whose assets did not exceed their liability,
including our U.S. domestic pension plans ( U.S. Retirement Plans ). At May 31, 2010 and 2009, the
fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a PBO or ABO in excess of plan assets were as
follows (in millions):

     ABO not used in determination of funded status. 

The APBO exceeds plan assets for each of our postretirement healthcare plans.

We made $848 million in tax-deductible contributions, including $495 million in voluntary
contributions, to our U.S. Retirement Plans during 2010. During 2009, we made $1.1 billion in
tax-deductible voluntary contributions to our U.S. Retirement Plans. Our U.S. Retirement Plans
have ample funds to meet expected benefits. For 2011, we anticipate making required contributions
to our U.S. Retirement Plans totaling approximately $500 million, a reduction from 2010 due to the
use of a portion of our credit balance.

Net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended May 31 were as follows (in millions):

The increase in pension costs from 2009 to 2010 was due to the negative impact of market conditions
on our pension plan assets at our May 31, 2009 measurement date. The reduction in pension costs
from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to the significantly higher discount rate that was used to
determine our 2009 expense.

Amounts recognized in OCI for all plans were as follows (in millions):

Weighted-average actuarial assumptions for our primary U.S. pension plans, which
represent substantially all of our PBO, are as follows:

that have been accrued to date (the PBO) to their present value.

Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid as follows for the
years ending May 31 (millions):

These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary
significantly from these estimates.

Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 8.5% during
2011, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 4.5% in 2029 and thereafter. Future dental benefit
costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 7% during 2011, decreasing to an annual growth
rate of 4.5% in 2029 and thereafter. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would not have a
significant impact on the APBO at May 31, 2010 or 2010 benefit expense because the level of these
benefits is capped.

NOTE 12: BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and the FedEx Freight LTL Group represent our major service lines and,
along with FedEx Services, form the core of our reportable segments. Our reportable segments
include the following businesses:

FedEx Express Segment 

FedEx Express (express transportation) 
FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services) 
FedEx SupplyChain Systems (logistics services) 

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery) 
FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator) 

FedEx Freight Segment 

FedEx Freight LTL Group: 
     FedEx Freight (fast-transit LTL freight transportation) 
     FedEx National LTL (economical LTL freight transportation) 
FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation) 

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services (sales, marketing and information technology functions) 
FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance) 
FedEx Customer Information Services ( FCIS ) (customer
service, billings and collections) 

-107- 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Services Segment 

The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information
technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and
allow us to pursue synergies from the combination of these functions. The FedEx Services segment
includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing and information technology support to our
other companies; FCIS, which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for U.S.
customers of our major business units; and FedEx Office, which provides an array of document and
business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses.
Effective September 1, 2009, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, formerly included in the FedEx Services
reporting segment, was realigned to become part of the FedEx Express reporting segment. Prior year
amounts have not been reclassified to conform to the current year segment presentation, as the
financial results are materially comparable.

The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses
and accordingly we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including
the net operating results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation
businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx Services segment allocation, the net
operating results of FedEx Office are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. We review and
evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of
FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based
on the impact of the total allocated net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment on our
transportation segments. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as
relative revenues or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net
cost of providing these functions. The $810 million 2009 impairment charge for the FedEx Office
goodwill and the $891 million 2008 charge predominantly associated with impairment of the Kinko s
trade name and goodwill were not allocated to the FedEx Express or FedEx Ground segments, as the
charges were unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial
summaries of our transportation segments in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and
Financial Condition ( MD A ) reflects the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the
respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes charges and
credits for administrative services provided between operating companies and certain other costs
such as corporate management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight,
including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. We believe these allocations
approximate the net cost of providing these functions.

Effective August 1, 2009, approximately 3,600 employees (predominantly from the FedEx Freight
segment) were transferred to entities within the FedEx Services segment. This internal
reorganization further centralizes most customer support functions, such as sales, customer service
and information technology, into our shared services organizations. While the reorganization had no
impact on the net operating results of any of our transportation segments, the net intercompany
charges to our FedEx Freight segment increased significantly with corresponding decreases to other
expense captions, such as salaries and employee benefits. The impact of this internal
reorganization to the expense captions in our other segments was immaterial.

Other Intersegment Transactions 

Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx
companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated
rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing
segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment
revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated results and are not separately identified
in the following segment information, as the amounts are not material.

NOTE 14: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale or purchase of operating assets
or services in the ordinary course of business, we may provide routine guarantees or
indemnifications (e.g., environmental, fuel, tax and software infringement), the terms of which
range in duration, and often they are not limited and have no specified maximum obligation. As a
result, the overall maximum potential amount of the obligation under such guarantees and
indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make
significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification obligations and no amounts have been
recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations.

Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to finance the
acquisition and construction of various airport facilities and equipment. These facilities were
leased to us and are accounted for as either capital leases or operating leases. FedEx Express has
unconditionally guaranteed $667 million in principal of these bonds (with total future principal
and interest payments of approximately $919 million as of May 31, 2010) through these leases. Of
the $667 million bond principal guaranteed, $116 million was included in capital lease obligations
in our balance sheet at May 31, 2010. The remaining $551 million has been accounted for as
operating leases.

NOTE 15: COMMITMENTS

Annual purchase commitments under various contracts as of May 31, 2010 were as follows (in
millions):

(1)  
       
     Our obligation to purchase 15 of these aircraft (Boeing 777 Freighters, or
B777Fs) is conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx Express or its employees not to
be covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended. Also, subsequent to May 31, 2010, we
entered into an agreement replacing the previously disclosed non-binding letter of intent with
another party to acquire two additional B777Fs and expect to take delivery of these aircraft in
2011. These aircraft are not included in the table above. 

(2)  
       
     Primarily aircraft modifications. 

(3)  
       
     Primarily vehicles, facilities, advertising, promotions contracts and for
2011, a total of $500 million of required quarterly contributions to our U.S. domestic pension
plans. 

The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable
agreements to purchase goods or services. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger
configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport
unless we have entered into noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft. Open purchase
orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial
reporting purposes and are not included in the table above.

We had $437 million in deposits and progress payments as of May 31, 2010 (a decrease of $107
million from May 31, 2009) on aircraft purchases and other planned aircraft-related transactions.
These deposits are classified in the  Other assets  caption of our  consolidated balance
sheets. In addition to our commitment to purchase B777Fs, our aircraft purchase commitments include
the Boeing 757 ( B757 ) in passenger configuration, which will require additional costs to modify
for cargo transport. Aircraft and aircraft-related contracts are subject to price escalations. The
following table is a summary of the number and type of aircraft we are committed to purchase as of
May 31, 2010, with the year of expected delivery:

previously disclosed non-binding letter of intent with another party to acquire two additional
B777Fs and expect to take delivery of these aircraft in 2011. These aircraft are not included in
the table above.

NOTE 16: CONTINGENCIES

Wage-and-Hour.  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits containing various class-action
allegations of wage-and-hour violations. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other
things, that they were forced to work  off the clock,  were not paid overtime or were not provided
work breaks or other benefits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages,
injunctive relief, or both. The following describes the wage-and-hour matters that have been
certified as class actions.

In February 2008,  Wiegele v. FedEx Ground  was certified as a class action by a California federal
court, and in April 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied our petition to
review the class certification ruling. The certified class initially included FedEx Ground sort
managers and dock service managers in California from May 10, 2002 to the present, but the court
subsequently approved the dismissal of the sort managers, leaving only the dock service managers in
the class. The plaintiffs allege that FedEx Ground has misclassified the managers as exempt from
the overtime requirements of California wage-and-hour laws and is correspondingly liable for
failing to pay them overtime compensation and provide them with rest and meal breaks. In April
2010, the court granted our motion to decertify the class, and thus the lawsuit continues as a
non-class matter. Therefore, any potential loss in this matter is immaterial.

In September 2008, in  Tidd v. Adecco USA, Kelly Services and FedEx Ground , a Massachusetts federal
court conditionally certified a class limited to individuals who were employed by two temporary
employment agencies and who worked as temporary pick-up-and-delivery drivers for FedEx Ground in
the New England region within the past three years. Potential claimants must voluntarily  opt in 
to the lawsuit in order to be considered part of the class. In addition, in the same opinion, the
court granted summary judgment in favor of FedEx Ground with respect to the plaintiffs  claims for
unpaid overtime wages. The court has since granted judgment in favor of the other two defendants
with respect to the overtime claims. Accordingly, the conditionally certified class of plaintiffs
is now limited to a claim of failure to pay regular wages due under the federal Fair Labor
Standards Act.

In April 2009, in  Bibo v. FedEx Express , a California federal court granted class certification,
certifying several subclasses of FedEx Express couriers in California from April 14, 2006 (the date
of the settlement of the  Foster  class action) to the present. The plaintiffs allege that FedEx
Express violated California wage-and-hour laws after the date of the  Foster  settlement. In
particular, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that they were forced to work  off the
clock  and were not provided with required meal breaks or split-shift premiums. We asked the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to accept a discretionary appeal of the class certification
order, but the court refused to accept it at this time.

In September 2009, in  Taylor v. FedEx Freight , a California state court granted class
certification, certifying a class of all current and former drivers employed by FedEx Freight in
California who performed linehaul services since June 2003. The plaintiffs allege, among other
things, that they were forced to work  off the clock  and were not provided with required rest or
meal breaks. In May 2010, we filed a notice to remove this matter to federal court in California.

These class certification rulings do not address whether we will ultimately be held liable. We
have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these wage-and-hour
lawsuits. Given the nature and status of these lawsuits, we cannot yet determine the amount or a
reasonable range of potential loss, if any. However, we do not believe that any loss is probable
in these lawsuits.

Independent Contractor   Lawsuits and State Administrative Proceedings.  FedEx Ground is involved
in approximately 50 class-action lawsuits (including 29 that are certified as class actions),
several individual lawsuits and approximately 40 state tax and other administrative proceedings
that claim that the company s owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than
independent contractors.

Most of the class-action lawsuits have been consolidated for administration of the pre-trial
proceedings by a single federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Indiana. With the exception of more recently filed cases that have been or will be transferred to
the multidistrict litigation, discovery on class certification and classification issues is now
complete. Thus far, the court has granted class certification in 28 cases and denied it in 14
cases. In June 2010, the court dismissed without prejudice  the previously certified
nationwide class claim under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974  based on the plaintiff s failure to exhaust
administrative remedies; this claim had been asserted as part of a
Kansas case, and the judge has not yet issued a summary judgment
decision on the remaining state law claims in that case. Motions for summary judgment on the classification issue ( i.e., 
independent contractor vs. employee) are pending in all 28 of the pending multidistrict litigation
cases that are certified as class actions.

In May 2010, in an Illinois case pending in the multidistrict litigation in which class
certification was denied, the court granted the three named plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment
on their claim under the Illinois wage law, holding that the three plaintiffs were employees under
that law. The court has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment on any of the
remaining claims in that case. The classification issue is state-law specific and varies from
state to state and from law to law within each state. Accordingly, the court s ruling in the
Illinois case is not binding authority for any of the remaining claims in that case or for any of
the other cases pending in the multidistrict litigation.

In January 2008, one of the contractor-model lawsuits that is not part of the multidistrict
litigation,  Anfinson v. FedEx Ground , was certified as a class action by a Washington state court.
The plaintiffs in  Anfinson  represent a class of FedEx Ground single-route, pickup-and-delivery
owner-operators in Washington from December 21, 2001 through December 31, 2005 and allege that the
class members should be reimbursed as employees for their uniform expenses and should receive
overtime pay. In March 2009, a jury trial in the  Anfinson  case was held, and the jury returned a
verdict in favor of FedEx Ground, finding that all 320 class members were independent contractors,
not employees. The plaintiffs have appealed the verdict. The other contractor-model purported
class actions that are not part of the multidistrict litigation are not as far along procedurally
as  Anfinson  and many of the lawsuits are currently stayed pending further developments in the
multidistrict litigation.

Adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our
contractors and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of
wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx
Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s
owner-operators. We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as
independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s
independent contractors. Given the nature and status of these lawsuits, we cannot yet determine
the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss, if any, but it is reasonably possible that such
potential loss or such changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s
owner-operators could be material. However, we do not believe that a material loss is probable in
any of these matters.

ATA Airlines.  ATA Airlines has sued FedEx Express in Indiana federal court alleging, among other
things, that we breached a contract by not including ATA on our 2009 Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF)/Air Mobility Command (AMC) team, which provides cargo and passenger service to the U.S.
military. After being advised that it would not be a part of the 2009 team, ATA ceased operations
and filed for bankruptcy. ATA has alleged damages of $94 million, including lost profits and
aircraft acquisition costs. We have denied any liability and contend that ATA has suffered no
damages. In April 2010, the court granted our motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and
dismissed all of ATA s claims except for the breach of contract claim. In June 2010, the court
denied our motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, so that claim is still
pending. Trial is currently scheduled for August 2010, and we still do not believe that any
material loss is probable.

Other.  FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any,
with respect to these other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Additional information about our contingencies can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis.

NOTE 17: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frederick W. Smith, currently holds an
approximate 10% ownership interest in the National Football League Washington Redskins professional
football team ( Redskins ) and is a member of its board of directors. FedEx has a multi-year
naming rights agreement with the Redskins granting us certain marketing rights, including the right
to name the Redskins  stadium  FedExField. 

NOTE 18: SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

(1)  
       
     Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 include charges of $1.2
billion ($1.1 billion, net of tax, or $3.46 per diluted share) primarily related to noncash
impairment charges associated with goodwill and aircraft-related asset impairments. 

(2)  
       
     The sum of the quarterly diluted earnings per share may not equal annual
amounts due to differences in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the
respective period.

NOTE 19: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We are required to present condensed consolidating financial information in order for the
subsidiary guarantors (other than FedEx Express) of our public debt to continue to be exempt from
reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The guarantor subsidiaries, which are wholly owned by FedEx, guarantee $1.2 billion of our debt.
The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Our guarantor subsidiaries were
not determined using geographic, service line or other similar criteria, and as a result, the
 Guarantor  and  Non-Guarantor  columns each include portions of our domestic and international
operations. Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not intended to present our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply with the
specific requirements for subsidiary guarantor reporting.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

INTEREST RATES.  While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest
rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the
interest rates are fixed on all of our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 5 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of
capital leases) with estimated fair values of $2.1 billion at May 31, 2010 and $2.4 billion at
May 31, 2009. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to $41 million
as of May 31, 2010 and $35 million as of May 31, 2009. The underlying fair values of our long-term
debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with
similar terms and maturities.

FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce and business
services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The
principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, Chinese
yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. Historically, our exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenues than our expenses, as a
significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel
expenses. During 2010, operating income was positively impacted due to foreign currency
fluctuations. During 2009, foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted operating income.
However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the
price we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2010, the
result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in
which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of $33
million for 2011. This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the
same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. This calculation is not indicative of our actual
experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in
exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign
currency sales price as competitors  services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity
analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a
potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.

COMMODITY.  While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk
is largely mitigated by our fuel surcharges because our fuel surcharges are closely linked to
market prices for fuel. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be
expected to materially affect our earnings.

However, our fuel surcharges have a timing lag (approximately six to eight weeks for FedEx Express
and FedEx Ground) before they are adjusted for changes in fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge index
also allows fuel prices to fluctuate approximately 2% for FedEx Express and approximately 5% for
FedEx Ground before an adjustment to the fuel surcharge occurs. Accordingly, our operating income
in a specific period may be significantly affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by
a substantial amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel
surcharges.

OTHER.  We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

SECOND AMENDMENT 

to the 

COMPOSITE LEASE AGREEMENT 

By and Between 

MEMPHIS-SHELBY COUNTY AIRPORT AUTHORITY 

and 

FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION 

Effective as of June 1, 2009 

SECOND AMENDMENT 
TO THE COMPOSITE LEASE AGREEMENT 

This Second Amendment, effective on the 1st   of June, 2009 (the  Effective Date ), by and
between MEMPHIS-SHELBY COUNTY AIRPORT AUTHORITY (herein referred to as  Authority ), a body politic
and corporate, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Tennessee, and FEDERAL EXPRESS
CORPORATION (herein referred to as  Tenant ), a corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and qualified to do business in the State of Tennessee (Authority and
Tenant are collectively referred to as  Parties ).

W I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS Authority and Tenant executed an instrument entitled  Composite Lease Agreement  with
an effective date of January 1, 2007 (that instrument, as previously amended by First Amendment to
the Composite Lease Agreement intended to be effective as of September 1, 2008, being herein called
the  Composite Lease Agreement  and

WHEREAS Authority and Tenant intended the Composite Lease Agreement to represent each of 23
separate lease agreements (later increased to 24) between the Parties and showed the differences
among the 23 (later 24) leases by attaching a schedule as Exhibit A to the Composite Lease
Agreement that identified each parcel of real property Authority leased to Tenant, the portion of
the Term (as defined in the Composite Lease Agreement) during which the lease of each parcel lease
will be in effect, and the rent that Tenant pays to Authority for each parcel; and

WHEREAS one of the parcels included in the Composite Lease Agreement was  Parcel 10  (herein
so called); and

WHEREAS Authority now desires to use the property known as Parcel 10, and more particularly
described and depicted in the attached Exhibit  A , incorporated by reference herein, for
construction activities related to the reconstruction of the eastern segments of Taxiways Alpha and
Victor beginning May 1, 2010, and ending approximately December 31, 2011; and

WHEREAS Authority and Tenant have agreed that, during the foregoing construction period,
Parcel 10 will be removed from the Leased Premises and the rent due to the Authority for Parcel 10
will be adjusted accordingly;

2  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the promises, covenants and agreements hereinafter
contained to be kept and performed by the parties hereto and upon the provisions and conditions
hereinafter set forth, Authority and Tenant do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

SECTION 1   Definitions   .  Except as otherwise provided herein, and unless the context
clearly requires otherwise, all words and terms used in this Second Amendment that are defined in
the Composite Lease Agreement will have, for all purposes of this Second Amendment, the respective
meanings given to them in the Composite Lease Agreement.

SECTION
2   Term   .  The term ( Term ) of this Second Amendment commences on May 1, 2010
(the  Commencement Date ), and expires on December 31, 2011.

SECTION 3   Rental Rate   . 

a. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the current rent for Parcel 10 is Three Thousand One
Hundred Thirty-Two Dollars and Twenty-Four Cents ($3,132.24) per month.

b. The Parties further agree that on May 1, 2010, and continuing throughout the Term, Parcel
10 will not be a part of the Leased Premises and Tenant shall not be obligated to pay rent for
Parcel 10, and the rent payable for the Leased Premises will be reduced by Three Thousand One
Hundred Thirty-Two Dollars and Twenty-Four Cents ($3,132.24) each month during the Term.

c. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the above does not in any way affect Tenant s
obligation to pay Authority all other rent due under the Composite Lease Agreement. Rental rates
are subject to increase or decrease annually in accordance with the rental rate provisions set
forth in the Composite Lease Agreement.

d. Upon the expiration of the Term, Parcel 10 will again become part of the Leased Premises
automatically and without any further action on the part of Authority or Tenant, and the rent
payable for the Leased Premises will be increased by Three Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Two Dollars
and Twenty-Four Cents ($3,132.24) per month as that amount would have been adjusted in accordance
with the terms of the Composite Lease Agreement if Parcel 10 had remained part of the Leased
Premises throughout the Term.

3  

SECTION 4   Use   . 

a. During the Term, Authority and its designee may use Parcel 10 solely for
construction-related activities incident to the reconstruction of certain taxiways, including, but
not limited to, a staging area, batch plant, setting up of temporary trailers or similar temporary
storage structures, the parking of contractor vehicles and construction equipment, storage of
materials, and office space. Authority agrees to notify Tenant in writing if Authority intends to
change its use of Parcel 10.

b. Authority agrees not to use Parcel 10 in any way that:

(i) 
       
      constitutes the commission of waste, the maintenance of a
nuisance, or the breach of any restriction or obligation set forth in the
Composite Lease Agreement; or

(ii) 
       
      involves the use, sale or introduction onto the premises of any
hazardous or toxic substances.

SECTION 5   Removal of Equipment   Beginning May 1, 2010, Authority shall remove from
Parcel 10, and properly dispose of, the trailers and kiosks presently located on Parcel 10 at
Authority s sole expense. Authority shall also remove from Parcel 10 the crew steps, tires and
other personal property currently located on Parcel 10 (the  Tenant s Equipment ) and shall store
the Tenant s Equipment on other property that Authority owns at the Memphis International Airport
(the  Airport ) and that is not leased to Tenant, all at Authority s sole expense. Prior to the
expiration of the Term or any earlier termination of this Second Amendment, Authority shall return
the Tenant s Equipment to Parcel 10 at Authority s sole expense. If, at any time during the Term,
Tenant requires any of the Tenant s Equipment for use in Tenant s operations, Authority shall allow
Tenant access to the site where Authority has stored Tenant s Equipment so that Tenant, at Tenant s
sole expense, may remove whatever portion of the Tenant s Equipment that Tenant may require.
Authority may store the Tenant s Equipment in the open and will have no liability for deterioration
of the Tenant s Equipment that occurs as a result of its exposure to the elements. Authority must,
however, repair at its expense any damage that occurs to any of the Tenant s Equipment during the
Term as a result of the fault or negligent act of any person that has access to the Tenant s
Equipment during the Term.

4  

SECTION 6   Construction of Improvements/Alterations.   The Composite Lease Agreement
obligates Tenant to keep the Leased Premises in good order and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted. The Parties understand and agree that Tenant shall not be held responsible for
any wear and tear or damage to Parcel 10 that occurs during the Term. Upon the expiration of the
Term or any earlier termination of this Second Amendment, Authority shall deliver possession of
Parcel 10 to Tenant in the condition that existed on the Commencement Date, except for reasonable
wear and tear, alterations and improvements that Authority makes to Parcel 10, but that Tenant does
not require Authority to remove, and damage that does not occur as a result of the negligence or
willful misconduct of Authority or any of its employees, agents, contractors or other invitees.

Authority may remove any fencing currently installed on Parcel 10 without consent from Tenant;
prior to the expiration of the Term or any earlier termination of this Second Amendment, however,
Authority must re-install any fencing it removes at the locations where presently installed.

Authority further agrees that Parcel 10 will be free from construction or other debris and all
construction related materials will be removed before Parcel 10 is returned to Tenant.

SECTION 7   Remainder of Composite Lease Agreement in Effect.   All other terms,
provisions, conditions, covenants and agreements of the Composite Lease Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect.

SECTION 8   Effective Date of this Second Amendment   .  This Second Amendment shall become
effective June 1, 2009.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused their duly authorized representatives to execute
this Second Amendment to the Composite Lease Agreement.

THIRD AMENDMENT

MEMPHIS-SHELBY COUNTY AIRPORT AUTHORITY

Effective as of July 1, 2009

THIRD AMENDMENT 
TO THE COMPOSITE LEASE AGREEMENT 

This Third Amendment, effective on the 1st   day of July, 2009 (the  Effective
Date ), by and between MEMPHIS-SHELBY COUNTY AIRPORT AUTHORITY (herein referred to as  Authority ),
a body politic and corporate, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Tennessee, and
FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (herein referred to as  Tenant ), a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and qualified to do business in the State of
Tennessee (Authority and Tenant are collectively referred to as  Parties .),

W I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS Authority and Tenant executed an instrument entitled  Composite Lease Agreement  with
an effective date of January 1, 2007 (that instrument, as previously amended by First Amendment to
the Composite Lease Agreement intended to be effective as of September 1, 2008, and by Second
Amendment to the Composite Lease Agreement intended to be effective as of June 1, 2009, being
herein called the  Composite Lease Agreement  and

WHEREAS Authority and Tenant intended the Composite Lease Agreement to represent each of 23
separate lease agreements between the Parties (later increased to 24) and showed the differences
among the 23 (later 24) leases by attaching a schedule as Exhibit A to the Composite Lease
Agreement that identified each parcel of real property Authority leased to Tenant, the portion of
the Term (as defined in the Composite Lease Agreement) during which the lease of each parcel will
be in effect, and the rent that Tenant pays to Authority for each parcel; and

WHEREAS Parcel 2, as described and depicted in the Composite Lease Agreement, includes
buildings designated as Hangars 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27 and land on which a building designated
as Hangar 26 previously stood; and

WHEREAS, prior to the parties  execution of the Composite Lease Agreement, Tenant removed
Hangar 26 with the Authority s consent, but the rent established in the Composite Lease Agreement
for Parcel 2 inadvertently did not reflect the earlier removal of that building; and

WHEREAS Tenant now intends with the Authority s consent to remove Hangars 21, 22 and 23 from
Parcel 2, to construct a new hangar (the  Replacement Hangar ) whose footprint will have an area of
approximately 35,419 square feet on the land where Hangars 21, 22 and 23 now stand, and to renovate
Hangars 24, 25 and 27; and

9 

WHEREAS the parties wish to amend the Composite Lease Agreement to reflect these changes and
to modify the rent owed by Tenant accordingly;

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the promises, covenants and agreements hereinafter
contained to be kept and performed by the parties hereto and upon the provisions and conditions
hereinafter set forth, Authority and Tenant do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

SECTION 1.   Definitions   .  Except as otherwise provided herein, and unless the context
shall clearly require otherwise, all words and terms used in this Third Amendment that are defined
in the Composite Lease Agreement shall, for all purposes of this Third Amendment, have the
respective meanings given to them in the Composite Lease Agreement.

SECTION 2.   Authority Consent  . Authority consents to the demolition of Hangars 21, 22
and 23, the construction of the Replacement Hangar and the renovation of Hangars 24, 25 and 27 in
accordance with the drawings and specifications described in   Exhibit A   attached to this
Amendment. Authority consents to any revision of those drawings and specifications that Tenant
causes to be made so long as the revision does not result in either a material reduction in the
size of the Replacement Hangar or a reduction in the estimated cost of the demolition, construction
and renovation depicted in those drawings and specifications.

SECTION 3.   Modification of Composite Lease and Applicable Rent   .  The Parties amend the
Composite Lease Agreement to reflect the removal of Hangar 26, the removal of Hangars 21, 22 and 23
in preparation for the building of the Replacement Hangar, and renovation of Hangars 24, 25 and 27.
As of the Effective Date, the Parties substitute the table attached to this Amendment for the
table included as part of Exhibit  A  to the Composite Lease Agreement. The substitution of that
Exhibit will accomplish the following:

(a) Effective as of July 1, 2009, the annual rent for Parcel 2 will be reduced by $15,870.00
to reflect the removal of Hangar 26. Because the execution of this Third Amendment is occurring
after July 1, 2009, the Effective Date, Tenant has overpaid rent for Parcel 2 in the amount of
$1,322.50 per month since the Effective Date. Accordingly, Tenant will receive a credit against
the installment of rent next becoming due under the terms of the Composite Lease Agreement after
the date the Parties execute and deliver this Third Amendment (as distinguished from its Effective
Date) in the aggregate amount of the overpayment.

10 

(b) Effective as of the later to occur of August 1, 2010, or the date on which Tenant
substantially completes the construction of the Replacement Hangar and Tenant s beneficial
occupancy of the Replacement Hangar begins, the annual rent for Parcel 2 will be reduced by
$44,246.00. The areas of the footprints of Hangars 21, 22 and 23 are 10,000 square feet, 7,000
square feet and 13,000 square feet respectively. Before this Amendment becomes effective, the
portion of the Parcel 2 rent allocable to that 30,000 square feet of building space and the land
underlying it is $50,917.00. At the rate that the Parties are currently using for the calculation
of that portion of the rent payable under the terms of the Composite Lease Agreement that is
allocable to unimproved land, the annual rent for the approximately 35,000 square feet of land that
will underlie the Replacement Hangar would be $6,671.00. As a result, the rent reduction described
above in this Subsection 3(b) will be the net amount after deducting $50,917.00 and adding
$6,671.00.

(c) Effective as of the later to occur of August 1, 2010, or the date on which Tenant
substantially completes the renovation of Hangar 24, 25 and 27 and Tenant s beneficial occupancy of
those Hangars begins, the annual rent for Parcel 2 will be reduced by $23,458.05. Before this
Amendment becomes effective, the portion of the Parcel 2 rent allocable to Hangars 24, 25 and 27 is
$78,193.49. The rent reduction described above in this Subsection 3(c) represents a thirty-percent
reduction in that portion of the Parcel 2 rent allocable to Hangars 24, 25 and 27, which reduction
the Authority is offering in order to induce Tenant to make the renovations to Hangars 24, 25 and
27.

The Parcel 2 rent, as adjusted in accordance with the foregoing, will continue to be subject
to adjustment in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03(a)(i) of the Composite Lease Agreement.

SECTION 4.   Remainder of Composite Lease in Effect   .  All other terms, provisions,
conditions, covenants and agreements of the Composite Lease shall continue in full force and
effect . 

SECTION 5.   Effective Dates of this Third Amendment   .  This Third Amendment becomes
effective as of July 1, 2009.

11 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused their duly authorized representatives to execute
this Third Amendment to the Composite Lease Agreement.

1993 Stock Incentive Plan  

Paragraph 13 of the FedEx Corporation 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, is hereby amended
by:

(1) Deleting the first sentence of such paragraph and replacing it with the following:

(a)  Changes in Capital .

(1)  Mandatory Adjustments . In the event of an  equity restructuring  (as such
term is defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation ), including any stock dividend, stock
split, spin-off, rights offering, or large nonrecurring cash dividend, the authorization
limit under paragraph 2 shall be adjusted proportionately, and the Committee shall make
such adjustments to the Plan and outstanding options as it deems necessary or appropriate,
in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential
benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, including: (A) adjustment of the
number and kind of shares or securities that may be issued under the Plan; (B) adjustment
of the number and kind of shares or securities subject to outstanding options; (C)
adjustment of the exercise price of outstanding options; and (D) any other adjustments that
the Committee determines to be equitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee
shall not make any adjustments to outstanding options to the extent that it causes such
options to provide for a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code
(including any applicable regulations and other guidance issued thereunder). Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock (a
stock split), a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a combination or
consolidation of the outstanding Common Stock into a lesser number of shares, the
authorization limit under paragraph 2 shall automatically be adjusted proportionately, and
the shares then subject to each outstanding option shall automatically, without the
necessity for any additional action by the Committee, be adjusted proportionately without
any change in the aggregate exercise price therefor.

(2)  Discretionary Adjustments . Upon the occurrence or in anticipation of any
share combination, exchange or reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or
other corporate reorganization affecting the Common Stock, or any transaction described
in paragraph 13(a)(1), in addition to any of the actions described in paragraph
13(a)(1), the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide: (A) that options will become
immediately vested and exercisable and will expire after a designated period of time to the
extent not then exercised; (B) that options will be equitably converted, adjusted or
substituted in connection with such transaction; (C) that outstanding options may be settled
by payment in cash or cash equivalents equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
underlying shares as of a specified date associated with the transaction, over the exercise
price of the option; or (D) any combination of the foregoing. The Committee s determination
need not be uniform and may be different for different optionees whether or not such
optionees are similarly situated.

(3)  No Fractional Shares, etc. . After giving effect to any adjustment pursuant
to the provisions of this paragraph 13(a), the number of shares subject to any option shall
always be a whole number, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Any discretionary
adjustments made pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 13(a) shall be subject to the
provisions of paragraph 15. To the extent any adjustments made pursuant to this paragraph
13(a) cause incentive stock options to cease to qualify as incentive stock options, such
options shall be deemed to be non-qualified stock options. 

and  

(2) Designating the remainder of such paragraph as  (b)  Change in Control . 

1995, 1997, 1999 and 2002 Stock Incentive Plans

spin-off, rights offering, or large nonrecurring cash dividend, the authorization limits
under paragraphs 2 and 5 shall be adjusted proportionately, and the Committee shall make
such adjustments to the Plan and outstanding options as it deems necessary or appropriate,
in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits
intended to be made available under the Plan, including: (A) adjustment of the number and
kind of shares or securities that may be issued under the Plan; (B) adjustment of the number
and kind of shares or securities subject to outstanding options; (C) adjustment of the
exercise price of outstanding options; and (D) any other adjustments that the Committee
determines to be equitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not make any
adjustments to outstanding options to the extent that it causes such options to provide for
a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code (including any applicable
regulations and other guidance issued thereunder). Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event of a subdivision of the
outstanding Common Stock (a stock split), a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock,
or a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Stock into a lesser number of

The following share counting rules shall apply to the Plan:

(a) The number of shares of Common Stock covered by an option shall be subtracted from
the Plan share reserve as of the grant date.

(b) To the extent an option is cancelled, terminates, expires, is forfeited or lapses
for any reason (in whole or in part), any unissued or forfeited shares of Common Stock
subject to the option shall be added back to the Plan share reserve and available again for
issuance pursuant to options granted under the Plan.

4 

(c) Shares of Common Stock withheld or deducted from an option by the Corporation to
satisfy tax withholding requirements shall not be added back to the Plan share reserve and
shall not again be available for issuance pursuant to options granted
under the Plan. Shares of Common Stock delivered by an optionee to the Corporation to
satisfy tax withholding requirements shall not be added back to the Plan share reserve and
shall not again be available for issuance pursuant to options granted under the Plan.

(d) To the extent that the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to an option
is not issued upon exercise of such option for any reason, including by reason of a net
settlement or net exercise, then all shares that were covered by the exercised option shall
not be added back to the Plan share reserve and shall not again be available for issuance
pursuant to options granted under the Plan.

(e) If the exercise price of an option is satisfied by delivering shares of Common
Stock to the Corporation (by either actual delivery or attestation), such shares shall not
be added to the Plan share reserve and shall not be available for issuance pursuant to
options granted under the Plan.

(f) Shares of Common Stock repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an
option exercise shall not be added to the Plan share reserve and shall not be available for
issuance pursuant to options granted under the Plan. 

and  

(2) Effective with respect to options granted on and after July 11, 2010, paragraph 6(b) of
the FedEx Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, is hereby amended by deleting  Unless
otherwise determined by the Committee,  and capitalizing  each. 

Incentive Stock Plan  

(1) Paragraph 6(c) of the FedEx Corporation Incentive Stock Plan, as amended, is hereby
amended to read in its entirety as follows:

(c)  Share Counting .

(1) The number of shares of Common Stock covered by an Award shall be subtracted from
the Plan share reserve as of the grant date.

(2) To the extent an Award is cancelled, terminates, expires, is forfeited or lapses
for any reason (in whole or in part), any unissued or forfeited shares of Common Stock
subject to the Award shall be added back to the Plan share reserve and available again for
issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan.

(3) Shares of Common Stock withheld or deducted from an Award by the Company to satisfy
tax withholding requirements relating to Stock Options shall not be added back to the Plan
share reserve and shall not again be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under
the Plan, but shares of Common Stock withheld or deducted by the Company to satisfy tax
withholding requirements relating to a Restricted Stock Award shall be added back to the
Plan share reserve and available again for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the
Plan. Shares delivered by a Participant to the Company to satisfy tax withholding
requirements shall be treated in the same way as
 shares withheld or deducted from an Award as specified above for purposes of share
counting under this  Section 6(c) .

5 

(4) To the extent that the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock
Option is not issued upon exercise of such Stock Option for any reason, including by reason
of a net settlement or net exercise, then all shares that were covered by the exercised
Stock Option shall not be added back to the Plan share reserve and shall not again be
available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan.

(5) If the exercise price of a Stock Option is satisfied by delivering shares of Common
Stock to the Company (by either actual delivery or attestation), such shares shall not be
added to the Plan share reserve and shall not be available for issuance pursuant to Awards
granted under the Plan.

(6) Shares of Common Stock repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of a Stock
Option exercise shall not be added to the Plan share reserve and shall not be available for
issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan. 

(2) Effective with respect to stock options granted on or after July 11, 2010, the first
sentence of Section 9(c)(2) of the FedEx Corporation Incentive Stock Plan, as amended, is hereby
amended by deleting  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee,  and capitalizing  each. 

(3) Section 14 of the FedEx Corporation Incentive Stock Plan, as amended, is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:

14. Changes in Capitalization 

(a)  Mandatory Adjustments . In the event of an  equity restructuring  (as such
term is defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation ), including any stock dividend, stock split,
spin-off, rights offering, or large nonrecurring cash dividend, the authorization limits
under  Sections 6(a) ,  6(b)  and  9(a)  shall be adjusted proportionately,
and the Committee shall make such adjustments to the Plan and outstanding Awards as it deems
necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of
benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, including: (a)
adjustment of the number and kind of shares or securities that may be issued under the Plan;
(b) adjustment of the number and kind of shares or securities subject to outstanding Awards;
(c) adjustment of the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options; and (d) any other
adjustments that the Committee determines to be equitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Committee shall not make any adjustments to outstanding Stock Options to the extent that
it causes such Stock Options to provide for a deferral of compensation subject to Code
Section 409A (including any applicable regulations and other guidance issued thereunder).
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock
(a stock split), a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or a combination or
consolidation of the outstanding Common Stock into a lesser number of shares, the
authorization limits under  Sections 6(a) ,  6(b)  and  9(a)  shall
automatically be adjusted proportionately, and the shares of Common Stock then subject
to each outstanding Award shall automatically, without the necessity for any additional
action by the Committee, be adjusted proportionately without any change in the aggregate
exercise price therefor.

6 

(b)  Discretionary Adjustments . Upon the occurrence or in anticipation of any
share combination, exchange or reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or
other corporate reorganization affecting the Common Stock, or any transaction described in
 Section 14(a) , in addition to any of the actions described in  Section 14(a) ,
the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide: (a) that Awards will become immediately
vested and exercisable and will expire after a designated period of time to the extent not
then exercised; (b) that Awards will be equitably converted, adjusted or substituted in
connection with such transaction; (c) that outstanding Stock Options may be settled by
payment in cash or cash equivalents equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
underlying shares of Common Stock as of a specified date associated with the transaction,
over the exercise price of the Stock Option; or (d) any combination of the foregoing. The
Committee s determination need not be uniform and may be different for different Participants
whether or not such Participants are similarly situated.

(c)  No Fractional Shares, etc. . After giving effect to any adjustment pursuant
to the provisions of this  Section 14 , the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
any Award shall always be a whole number, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Any
discretionary adjustments made pursuant to the provisions of this  Section 14  shall be
subject to the provisions of  Section 16 . To the extent any adjustments made pursuant
to this  Section 14  cause Incentive Stock Options to cease to qualify as Incentive
Stock Options, such Stock Options shall be deemed to be Non-Qualified Options. 

Approved by the Compensation Committee on July 11, 2010

named executive officers are effective as of July 1, 2010.

Fiscal 2011 Annual Incentive Compensation Program 

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 

Frederick W. Smith s fiscal 2011 annual bonus will be based on the achievement of corporate
objectives for consolidated pre-tax income for fiscal 2011. The independent members of the Board
of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may adjust Mr. Smith s bonus
amount upward or downward based on their annual evaluation of Mr. Smith s performance, including
the quality and effectiveness of his leadership and the following corporate performance measures:

FedEx s stock price performance relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite
Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
competitors; 

FedEx s stock price to earnings (P/E) ratio relative to the Standard   Poor s 500
Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and competitors; 

FedEx s market capitalization; 

FedEx s revenue and operating income growth relative to competitors; 

FedEx s free cash flow (excluding business acquisitions), return on invested capital
(excluding certain unusual items), and weighted average cost of capital; 

Analyst coverage and ratings for FedEx s stock; 

FedEx s U.S. and international revenue market share; 

FedEx s reputation rankings by various publications and
surveys; and 

FedEx s restoration of remaining company matching
contributions for 401(k) program. 

None of these factors will be given any particular weight in determining whether to adjust Mr.
Smith s bonus amount.

Mr. Smith s annual bonus target for fiscal 2011 is 130% of his annual base salary (at fiscal
year-end), with a maximum payout of 300% of his target bonus.

Non-CEO Named Executive Officers 

The fiscal 2011 annual bonus target payouts for the non-CEO named executive officers, as a
percentage of annual base salary (at fiscal year-end), are as follows:

The maximum payout for each executive is 240% of his target bonus.

The fiscal 2011 annual bonus for the non-CEO named executive officers will be based on:

the achievement of individual objectives established at the beginning of the fiscal
year for each executive (30% of each executive s target bonus); and 

the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated pre-tax income for fiscal
2011 (70% of each executive s target bonus). 

The annual bonus payout opportunity relating to individual performance will be partially
contingent upon achievement of consolidated pre-tax income objectives under the bonus plan (as well
as achievement of the individual performance objectives). Mr. Smith will determine the achievement
level of each executive s individual objectives at the conclusion of fiscal 2011.

The annual bonus payout opportunity relating to company financial performance ranges, on a
sliding scale, from a minimum amount if the annual bonus plan s pre-established consolidated
pre-tax income threshold is achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goal is
substantially exceeded. Ordinarily, our business plan objective for consolidated pre-tax income is
the target under the annual bonus plan. For fiscal 2011, however, the annual bonus plan s
consolidated pre-tax income target and even the threshold for the portion of the payout opportunity
relating to company financial performance are higher than the business plan objective for
consolidated pre-tax income.

2  

Long-Term Incentive Program  

FedEx s long-term incentive ( LTI ) plans for the three-fiscal-year periods 2009 through 2011,
2010 through 2012 and 2011 through 2013, provide long-term cash bonus opportunities to members of
upper management, including the named executive officers, upon the conclusion of fiscal 2011, 2012
and 2013, respectively, if certain aggregate fully diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) goals
established by the Board of Directors are achieved with respect to those periods. No amounts can
be earned for the fiscal 2009 through 2011, 2010 through 2012 and 2011 through 2013 plans until
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, because achievement of the EPS goals can only be determined
following the conclusion of the applicable three-fiscal-year period.

Traditionally, the base-year number over which the three-year average annual EPS growth rate
goals are measured for an LTI plan is the final full-year EPS of the preceding fiscal year. For
the fiscal 2010 through 2012 LTI plan, an adjusted base-year number ($2.93) was used rather than
the final fiscal 2009 EPS. This adjusted base-year number was set so that 12.5% growth from the
number would equal the fiscal 2010 business plan EPS goal.

The following table sets forth the potential future payouts to each of FedEx s named executive
officers under FedEx s LTI plans:

The potential individual future payouts set forth in the table above are set dollar amounts
ranging from threshold (minimum) amounts, if the EPS goal achieved is less than target, up to
maximum amounts, if the plan goal is substantially exceeded. There can be no assurance that the
potential future payouts shown in this table will be achieved.
