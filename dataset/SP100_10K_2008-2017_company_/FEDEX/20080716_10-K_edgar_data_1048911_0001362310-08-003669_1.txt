PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business
services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed
collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four reportable
business segments:

FedEx Express  : Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ) is the world s largest
express transportation company, offering time-certain delivery within one to three business
days and serving markets that comprise more than 90% of the world s gross domestic product.
The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc., which provides
international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global cargo distribution. 

FedEx Ground  : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ) is a leading provider of
small-package ground delivery service. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to
every business address in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as residential
delivery to nearly 100% of U.S. residences through FedEx Home Delivery. The FedEx Ground
segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc., which specializes in the consolidation and
delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages
using the U.S. Postal Service for final delivery to residences. 

FedEx Freight:   FedEx Freight Corporation is a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload
( LTL ) freight services through its FedEx Freight business (regional LTL freight services)
and its FedEx National LTL business (long-haul LTL freight services). The FedEx Freight
segment also includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., North America s largest time-specific,
critical shipment carrier, and Caribbean Transportation Services, Inc., a leading provider of
airfreight forwarding services between the United States and Puerto Rico. 

FedEx Services:   FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ) provides sales,
marketing and information technology support, as well as customer service support through
FedEx Customer Information Services, Inc., primarily for the benefit of FedEx Express and
FedEx Ground. The FedEx Services segment also includes FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc.
( FedEx Office ), formerly known as FedEx Kinko s, a leading provider of document solutions
and business services, and FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, Inc., which offers a range of
supply chain solutions. 

In June 2008, we announced our decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name and to change
the name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office and the name of the company s locations to FedEx Office
and Print Centers. The new name better reflects the wide range of services available at the retail
centers and takes full advantage of the powerful FedEx brand. The centers will be rebranded over
the next several years.

For financial information concerning our reportable business segments, refer to the accompanying
financial section, which includes management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and
financial condition and our consolidated financial statements.

Strategy 

FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company of our
operating companies. Through our holding company, we provide strategic direction to, and
coordination of, the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending
the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire
portfolio of integrated business solutions.

We are pursuing a number of initiatives to continue to enhance the FedEx customer experience. For
instance, notwithstanding short-term macro-economic conditions, we continue to expand our
transportation networks (as described below) to accommodate future volume growth and increase
customer convenience. In addition, we are broadening and more effectively bundling our portfolio
of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers, such as through our integration
of recent acquisitions in the long-haul LTL freight and international domestic express
transportation markets, and our new and improved service offerings. For example, in 2008, we
launched FedEx International Economy service in ten Asia-Pacific markets (where we already offered
FedEx International Priority service), and we significantly enhanced our FedEx SameDay service
offerings with the addition of same-day services for freight shipments and a new intra-city
same-day service in select markets.

We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the
extensive automation of our package delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated
across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx
companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe
that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple
operating units. For example, our recently redesigned Web site,  fedex.com , provides a single point
of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipment
tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly,
by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily
evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and
FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one
point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their
pickup and delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being
shipped.

We manage our business as a portfolio   in the long-term best interest of FedEx as a whole, not a
particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of
delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on
achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each
FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to
optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to
managing
collaboratively, our management incentive compensation programs are tied to the performance of
FedEx as a whole.

4 

Table of Contents   

While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we
continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective
markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit.
Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise.
Each company s operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer
needs of a particular market segment.

Our  compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively  strategy also provides
flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic
conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate. For example:

To accommodate anticipated international growth at FedEx Express, we are purchasing
aircraft and improving services to and from Europe and Asia based on the long-term growth
prospects of these regions. 

We are expanding network capacity at our fast growing FedEx Ground company. For instance,
we expect to increase FedEx Ground s daily package pick-up capacity to approximately five
million packages by 2012. 

We are slowing the expansion of FedEx Office s retail network as a result of, among other
things, reduced customer demand for the company s copy and print services. 

Despite the current macro-economic slowdown and record high fuel prices, we believe the following
four trends continue to drive world commerce and shape the global marketplace:

Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses:   High-tech and high-value-added
goods continue to increase as a percentage of total economic output. Our various operating
companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and
high-value-added industries. 

Globalization:   As the world s economy becomes more fully integrated, and as barriers to
trade continue to decrease, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers in
more than 220 countries and territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global
reach, delivery services and information capabilities. 

Supply Chain Acceleration:   As the economy has become increasingly global, it has also
become more fast-paced, and companies of all sizes now depend on the delivery of just-in-time
inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward faster, more
efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain near real-time information to manage
inventory in motion, thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market. 

Growth of E-Commerce:   E-commerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a
vital growth engine for businesses today. Through our global transportation and technology
networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce. 

5 

Table of Contents   

These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access   to goods, services and
information. This access is fueling a remarkable transformation of the world s economy, helping
businesses and nations flourish, and empowering individuals with greater choices and opportunities.
Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to make
this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this
access and move toward even stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability by:

Optimizing and expanding our worldwide FedEx Express network, particularly in key markets
such as China, India and Europe. 

Increasing the capacity, speed and reliability of our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight
networks. 

Emphasizing the  compete collectively  part of our core strategy through service
improvements and focusing on delivering the best customer experience in the industry,
resulting in better alignment across all FedEx networks. 

In sum, our overall long-term goal is to:

deliver superior financial returns for our stockholders; 

expand our portfolio of services to meet our customers  needs; and 

execute our  compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively  strategy
with both discipline and imagination. 

Reputation and Responsibility 

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the
world s most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected brands in the
world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation
awards we received during 2008:

FedEx ranked seventh in  FORTUNE  magazine s  America s Most Admired Companies  list and
sixth in its  World s Most Admired Companies  list   the seventh consecutive year we have been
ranked in the top ten on both lists. 

FedEx ranked in the top 15 in  corporate reputation  and first in the category of customer
service in the Harris Interactive Reputation Quotient (RQ) Survey. 

FedEx continued to rank highest in customer satisfaction in the University of Michigan
Business School National Quality Research Center s  American Customer Satisfaction Index  in the
express delivery category. 

According to a poll conducted by  Institutional Investor  magazine, FedEx was rated as the
most shareholder-friendly company and Frederick W. Smith was named the top CEO in our
industry. Mr. Smith was also named among the top 30 chief executives in the world by  Barron s 
magazine. 

FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological
innovation, but also in corporate social responsibility and sustainability. FedEx understands that
a sustainable business is intrinsically tied to a sustainable society. We are committed to
sustainably connecting the world, and enhancing the long-term value of the company for our
shareowners and employees, and for the communities and businesses that rely on our services. We
expect to publish our first corporate social
responsibility (CSR) report later this year. The report will measure and document FedEx s response
to many global and local issues and opportunities that are relevant to our mission, values and core
competencies.

Our People  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged
as a great place to work. In 2008, we were listed among FORTUNE s  100 Best Companies to Work for
in America,  a list that we have made in ten of the past eleven years. It is our people   our
greatest asset   that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and
information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 290,000 employees and
contractors who are  absolutely, positively  focused on safety, the highest ethical and
professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal
Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance
customer service and promote human welfare.

Our Community  

We are committed to causes that help improve the communities where we live and work, all around the
world. As an example, we routinely donate our transportation capabilities and services to deliver
aid to disaster sites and to support charitable causes, such as in support of the China earthquake
and Myanmar (Burma) relief efforts this calendar year. We promote diversity by, among other
things, making contributions to non-profit organizations that promote access to education, such as
the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the United Negro College Fund and the Asian   Pacific Islander
American Scholarship Fund.

In addition to corporate philanthropy and employee volunteerism, we develop strategic relationships
with certain charitable organizations that share our values, including:

United Way of America:  We believe the United Way is one of the most effective and
efficient ways of meeting community needs. FedEx supports a yearly fundraising campaign
company-wide, and during our annual  FedEx Cares Week,  FedEx employee volunteers donate
thousands of hours to support United Way community efforts. 

American Red Cross:  FedEx works with the Red Cross to provide a quick response to
disasters around the world. FedEx uses its logistics and transportation expertise to provide
complimentary shipping of emergency supplies and assists with financial support. 

Safe Kids Worldwide:  Reflecting the fact that safety is one of our top priorities, FedEx
is the sole corporate sponsor of Safe Kids  Walk This Way,  a global program that advocates
child pedestrian safety and teaches children, parents and communities how to prevent
pedestrian accidents. 

ORBIS International:  FedEx helps ORBIS International provide eye care and treatment to
people in developing countries. FedEx provides free aircraft maintenance and our pilots
volunteer their time for ORBIS s  Flying Eye Hospital    a converted DC-10 aircraft equipped
with surgical and training facilities. 

Salvation Army:  FedEx supports the Salvation Army s training of emergency response
personnel worldwide through an initiative called Prepare to Respond to Emergencies   Planning
and Readiness
Education (PREPARE). To date, FedEx has provided funding for eleven Emergency Services Response
Units, which are deployed during emergencies and disasters.

Table of Contents   

Heart to Heart International:  FedEx helps Heart to Heart International deliver food,
medicine and emergency supplies to areas in need throughout the world. 

National Civil Rights Museum:  FedEx serves as a major corporate sponsor of the National
Civil Rights Museum, which educates the public on the lessons of the civil rights movement in
the United States and its impact and influence on the human rights movement worldwide. 

Teach for America:  FedEx supports Teach for America in its efforts to provide students of
diverse backgrounds with a high-quality education. In 2008, FedEx announced a $1 million
donation to Teach for America to further the organization s goal of increasing the diversity
of its teachers. 

Junior Achievement:  Through support of Junior Achievement, FedEx helps to ensure that our
future leaders have access to educational opportunities. Through a recent $1 million pledge,
FedEx launched a global competition that will enable teams of students from around the world
to compete for the FedEx Global Impact Award. 

March of Dimes:  FedEx is a national sponsor of March of Dimes   March for Babies,  and
thousands of FedEx employees participate in it and other events that raise funds to help
improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. 

The Environment  

We are committed to protecting the environment. FedEx evaluates the environmental impacts of FedEx
packaging and copy and print services, and minimizes waste generation through efforts that include
recycling and pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with a high recycled content.

FedEx is actively involved in efforts to promote cleaner air by reducing emissions through
efficient route planning and the use of clean, alternative and renewable energy sources. First in
our industry to introduce hybrid vans in our fleet, we now operate more than 170 hybrid vehicles
around the globe, with more than two million miles in revenue service. Our hybrid electric
vehicles decrease greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 percent and increase fuel economy by
over 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles.

Our solar power generation systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive
environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. In 2008, we installed solar-electric
systems at two of FedEx Freight s facilities in California. In calendar 2005, we opened
California s then largest corporate solar electric rooftop system atop the FedEx Express regional
hub in Oakland. To date, this solar electric system has provided approximately 3.2 gigawatt hours
of renewable energy.

We are also modernizing our aircraft fleet. For example, we are retiring and replacing older
Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient and quieter Boeing 757s. The use of newer and more fuel
efficient aircraft will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increase our jet
fuel efficiency. Also, as noted below, we have selected the fuel-efficient Boeing 777 Freighter
( B777F ) aircraft to meet future international expansion needs.

Table of Contents   

Governance  

FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance.
Reflecting this commitment, we have embraced the spirit of corporate governance reform rather than
merely meeting the minimum compliance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
New York Stock Exchange s corporate governance listing standards. We have implemented many
governance enhancements that go well beyond those legal requirements. For example, we use a
majority-voting standard in uncontested director elections and have a resignation requirement for
directors who fail to receive the required majority vote, and the Board is prohibited from changing
back to a plurality-voting standard without the approval of our stockholders.

In addition, we have made compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 one of our highest priorities, and we have leveraged this effort to
further improve our already rigorous disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal
control over financial reporting. Our goal has been not only to comply with the law, but also to
build upon a process that will further enhance a strong controls mindset across FedEx today and in
the future.

Our Board of Directors reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our
Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct   Ethics, at least annually in
light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding
commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which
applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer
and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section of the Investor
Relations page of our Web site at  http://www.fedex.com/us/investorrelations . We will post in the
corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding
any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is
required. The information on our Web site, however, does not form part of this Report.

Business Segments 

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:

Services 

FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for delivery of packages and freight.
Overnight package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to virtually the entire
United States population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight delivery services: FedEx First
Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is
available for urgent shipments up to 70 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express
also offers express freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the

For information regarding FedEx Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services  
Technology. 

International Expansion 

FedEx Express is focused on further expanding its international presence, especially in key markets
such as China, India and Europe. During 2007, we made several strategic acquisitions in those
markets, each of which is expected to provide important contributions to our long-term growth,
productivity and profitability.

We acquired ANC Holdings Ltd. (now rebranded as FedEx UK), a United Kingdom domestic
express transportation company. The acquisition of FedEx UK has allowed us to establish a
domestic service in the United Kingdom and better serve the U.K. international market, which
we previously served primarily through independent agents. 

We acquired Prakash Air Freight Pvt. Ltd. ( PAFEX ), our primary service provider in India.
The acquisition of PAFEX extends our operations in the global express industry with a wholly
owned company in one of the world s fastest growing markets. 

We acquired Tianjin Datian W. Group Co., Ltd. s ( DTW Group ) fifty percent share of the
FedEx-DTW International Priority joint venture and assets relating to DTW Group s domestic
network in China. The acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group, formed in 1999,
into a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition increases our presence in China in the
international market and establishes our presence in the domestic market. 

We began serving China in 1984, and since that time, we have expanded our service to cover more
than 200 cities and counties across the country. We now employ more than 6,000 workers in China.
In addition to the DTW Group acquisition, we have recently taken several other important actions
that increase our presence in China and bolster our leadership in the global air cargo industry.
For example:

In 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International
Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the
current activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, in 2009. We believe the new
hub will better serve our global customers doing business in and with the fast-growing China
and Asia-Pacific markets. 

In 2007, we initiated next-morning domestic delivery service in China, which is available
in more than 40 cities and counties throughout the country. The new China domestic service is
supported by a money-back guarantee and real-time package status tracking. Our China domestic
network relies on a hub-and-spoke system centered at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International
Airport, located in East China s Zhejiang Province.

In support of our international expansion, we have agreed to purchase 15 B777F aircraft, a new
high-capacity, long-range airplane, with deliveries beginning in calendar 2009. We also hold an
option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. To facilitate the use of our growing
international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a
variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with
international shipping requirements.

U.S. Postal Service Agreement 

Under a July 2006 agreement with the U.S. Postal Service that runs through September 2013, FedEx
Express provides domestic air transportation services to the U.S. Postal Service, including for its
First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. FedEx Express also has approximately 5,000 drop boxes at
U.S. Post Offices in approximately 340 metropolitan areas and provides transportation and delivery
for the U.S. Postal Service s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed
(GXG).

Pricing 

FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its
services. In general, during 2008, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected,
destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up
by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Express, FedEx Office and
Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. International rates are based on the type of
service provided and vary with size, weight, destination and, whenever applicable, whether the
shipment was picked up by a FedEx Express courier or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx
Express, FedEx Office and Print Center or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter location. FedEx Express
offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue
produced.

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for
shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge
percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on the spot price for jet fuel. For example, the
fuel surcharge for June 2008 was based on the spot price for jet fuel published for April 2008.
Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the spot price for jet
fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month.
These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each
month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The
weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates
for the past three years was: 2008   17%; 2007   13%; and
2006   14%. These percentages reflect the base rate increases
that are associated with certain fuel surcharge reductions.

Operations 

FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company s
multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility, which we are significantly
expanding, is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates
regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, and Fort Worth and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los
Angeles and Chicago. FedEx Express is building a new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina,
which is scheduled to begin operations in calendar 2009.

11 

Table of Contents   

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris and Subic Bay, Philippines, serve as sorting facilities for express
package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major
sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport
outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Subic Bay and Paris are also
designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami   the
Miami Gateway Hub   serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets. As noted
above, in 2006, we broke ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International
Airport in Southern China. The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current
activities of our existing hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009.

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of
customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the
station s service area. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part
I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption  FedEx Express Segment.  In some
international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants) have been selected to
complete deliveries and to pick up packages.

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. locations.
FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites.
Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office
buildings, shopping centers, corporate or industrial parks and outside U.S. Post Offices.

Fuel Supplies and Costs 

During 2008, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in
length and which provide for specific amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by
these contracts is purchased at market prices that may fluctuate daily. Because of our indexed
fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See  FedEx Express   Pricing. 

The following table sets forth FedEx Express s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of total
revenues for the last five fiscal years:

Approximately 10% of FedEx Express s requirement for vehicle fuel is purchased in bulk. The
remainder of FedEx Express s requirement is satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.

Competition 

The express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and
service. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency and capacity of
scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and
innovative service offerings. Competitors in these markets include other package delivery
concerns, principally United Parcel Service,
Inc. ( UPS ), DHL, passenger airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery
concerns, airfreight forwarders and the U.S. Postal Service.

12 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Express s principal competitors in the international market are DHL, UPS, foreign postal
authorities such as Deutsche Post and TNT N.V., freight forwarders, passenger airlines and
all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Express s competitors in the international market are
government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower
costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.

Employees 

David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is
headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Express employed approximately
94,700 permanent full-time and 50,300 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 16% are
employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Express s international employees in the aggregate represent
approximately 25% of all employees. FedEx Express believes its relationship with its employees is
excellent.

The pilots of FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International
( ALPA ), and are employed under a four-year collective bargaining agreement that took effect in
October 2006. Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees
occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification
of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the
outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees.

FedEx Trade Networks  

FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and
global cargo distribution. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx
Express at its major hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an
information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides
international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership
Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks
publishes customs duty and tax information for over 100 customs areas worldwide. FedEx Trade
Networks has approximately 3,700 employees and 100 offices in 80 service locations throughout North
America and in Asia. Offices are maintained in major European markets and additional Asian
locations through dedicated agents.

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground  

Overview 

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information
technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive
position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back-guaranteed ground package
delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market,
focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground
service is provided to 100% of the continental United States population and overnight service of up to 400
miles to nearly 100% of the continental United States population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of
the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Puerto Rico, Alaska and
Hawaii through a
ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers, primarily FedEx
Express.

13 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by
reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing or expanding overnight ground service
in many metropolitan areas. In addition, to meet growing customer demand for its services, FedEx
Ground is in the midst of a major network capacity expansion program, which is expected to increase
its daily pick-up capacity to approximately five million packages by 2012. The multi-phase plan
includes the addition of hubs, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of
other existing facilities. Each of the new hubs will feature the latest automated sorting
technology.

In addition to the continuing success of FedEx Ground s business-to-business service, the
increasing popularity of FedEx Home Delivery, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences, has
driven growth in the company s package volumes and financial results. FedEx Home Delivery is
dedicated exclusively to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine
Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature
delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their
customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back
guarantee.

Pricing 

FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service
Guide. In general, during 2008, U.S. shipping rates were based on the service selected,
destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the shipment was picked up
by a FedEx Ground contractor or dropped off by the customer at a FedEx Office and Print Center or
FedEx Authorized ShipCenter.

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The
surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price
for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example,
the fuel surcharge for June 2008 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April
2008. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index
average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month.
These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each
month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.

Operations 

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of
approximately 520 facilities, including 30 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its
operations primarily with approximately 22,000 owner-operated vehicles and 29,500 company-owned
trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup
operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Delivery s operations are often co-located with
existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.

Advanced automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of over 3.3 million
packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based scan technology, hub conveyors
electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for
transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and
Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal
package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and
proof-of-delivery signature functionality
through the FedEx Web site,  fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground
e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services   Technology.

Table of Contents   

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. locations.
FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.

As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Ground had approximately 46,500 employees and 13,250 independent
contractors. Although FedEx Ground believes its relationship with its employees and independent
contractors is excellent, the company is involved in numerous purported or certified class-action
lawsuits and other proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators should be treated as
employees, rather than independent contractors. For a description of these proceedings, see Item
1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ) and Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

David F. Rebholz is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is
headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, DHL and the U.S.
Postal Service.

residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog
companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a U.S. Postal
Service facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its network of 20 distribution
hubs and approximately 2,200 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery Monday through Saturday

FedEx Freight specializes in fast-cycle distribution and provides tailored shipping solutions to
help shippers meet tight deadlines. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match
customers  time-critical needs with reduced transit times, after-hours pickup or delivery, or
same-day delivery. FedEx Freight s fully integrated Web site and other e-tools, including a bill
of lading generator and e-mail
delivery notification, make freight shipping easier and bring customers closer to their own account
information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice service feature uses the company s innovative
technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the Internet, e-mail or fax
when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater
visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments.

Since the acquisition of FedEx National LTL, we have significantly improved the company s on-time
service reliability by integrating and reengineering its network. FedEx National LTL is now a
leader when it comes to reliability in the long-haul LTL freight market segment (three-day and more
service lanes). FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL have an indexed fuel surcharge, which is
subject to weekly adjustment based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average
price for a gallon of diesel fuel. During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Freight reduced its
standard regional LTL fuel surcharge by 25% and FedEx National LTL reduced its standard LTL fuel
surcharge to levels commensurate with FedEx Freight.

As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Freight Corporation was operating approximately 61,000 vehicles and
trailers from a network of approximately 475 service centers, and the FedEx Freight segment had
approximately 36,500 employees. Douglas G. Duncan is the President and Chief Executive Officer of
FedEx Freight Corporation, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight s primary
multiregional LTL freight competitors are Con-Way Freight, a subsidiary of Con-way Inc., YRC
Regional Transportation (which comprises the USF regional companies), a division of YRC Worldwide
Inc., and UPS Freight. FedEx National LTL s primary long-haul LTL freight competitors are YRC
National Transportation (which comprises Yellow Transportation and Roadway), a division of YRC
Worldwide Inc., and ABF Freight System, Inc.

core of our comprehensive technology strategy.

Our technology strategy is driven by our desire for customer satisfaction. We strive to build
technology solutions that will solve our customers  business problems with simplicity, convenience,
speed and reliability. The focal point of our strategy is our award-winning Web site, together
with our customer integrated solutions.

Trademarks 

The  FedEx  trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx,
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx Global Supply Chain
Services, FedEx Customer Information Services, FedEx National LTL, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx
SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of
Federal Express Corporation for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file.
We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service
marks and trade names by our contractors and Global Service Participants to support our business.
In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on
promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

Regulation 

Air . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of
Transportation ( DOT ) and the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) exercise regulatory
authority over FedEx Express.

The FAA s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation,
including aircraft standards, maintenance and corrosion control, as well as personnel and ground
facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft
in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA
pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited
duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets
the operational requirements of the regulations.

19 

Table of Contents   

The DOT s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT s
jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the
transfer of route
authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT,
authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and
mail on a worldwide basis.

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security
Administration ( TSA ), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility
for aviation security. In May 2006, the TSA adopted new rules enhancing many of the security
requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, and in May 2007, the TSA
issued a revised model all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new rules.
Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we have filed comments with the TSA requesting
clarification regarding several provisions in the revised model program. Until the requirements
for our security program under the new rules are finalized, we cannot determine the effect that
these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably
possible, however, that these rules or other future security
requirements (including those of foreign governments, as noted below) for air cargo carriers
could impose material costs on us.

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ( CRAF ) program. Under this program,
the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express s
wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx
Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at
standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through
its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo
charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts
with the U.S. Government for charter flights.

Ground . The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation
services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated
the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air
carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and
insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx National LTL and FedEx Custom Critical in
interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation
preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements
governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both
federal and state regulations.

International . FedEx Express s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from
points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates
international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against
discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States
carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT s approval and generally requires a bilateral
agreement between the United States and the foreign government. The carrier must then be granted
the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory
environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to
operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally,
global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current
and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign
governments.

Our operations within foreign countries, such as FedEx Express s growing international domestic
operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations that restrict, and sometimes
prohibit, our ability to compete in parts of the transportation and logistics market. As an
example, China is currently
considering postal regulation that would substantially limit, if not exclude, foreign-invested
companies such as FedEx from competing in the China domestic document delivery market.

Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its
aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal
Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications
Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express s activities pertaining to satellite
communications.

Environmental . Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise.
FedEx Express s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal
aviation regulations. FedEx Express s aircraft are also subject to, and are in compliance with,
the regulations governing engine emissions. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise,
certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of
aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express s
aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on
any of FedEx Express s significant markets. Congress s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity
Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise
reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express s international operations
are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among
other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and
the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office s copy machines and photo film
developing operations. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with
underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise
and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management
programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.

Customs.  Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to
regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of
Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission
(ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (airfreight forwarding). Our offshore operations are
subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.

The DC10s are three-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have been specially modified to meet
FedEx Express s cargo requirements. We operate two models, the DC10-10 and the DC10-30. The

upgrades of electrical and other systems. 

The A300s and A310s are two-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have a longer range and more
capacity than B757s and B727s. 

The B757s are two-engine aircraft configured for cargo service. 

The B727s are three-engine aircraft configured for cargo service. 

The ATR, Fokker F27 and Cessna 208 turbo-prop aircraft are leased to independent operators
to support FedEx Express operations in areas where demand does not justify use of a larger
aircraft. 

An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each aircraft type.

In addition, FedEx Express  wet leases  approximately 50 smaller piston-engine and turbo-prop
aircraft, which feed packages to and from airports served by FedEx Express s larger jet aircraft.
The wet lease agreements call for the owner-lessor to provide the aircraft, flight crews, insurance
and maintenance, as well as fuel and other supplies required to operate the aircraft. FedEx
Express s wet lease agreements are for terms not exceeding one year and are generally cancelable
upon 30 days  notice.

At May 31, 2008, FedEx Express operated approximately 51,500 ground transport vehicles, including
pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks called container transport vehicles and over-the-road
tractors and trailers.

FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, which serves as the center of its multiple hub-and-spoke
system, is located at the Memphis International Airport. FedEx Express s facilities at the Memphis
International Airport also include aircraft hangars, aircraft ramp areas, vehicle parking areas,
flight training and fuel facilities, administrative offices and warehouse space. FedEx Express
leases these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the  Authority ). The
lease obligates FedEx Express to maintain and insure the leased property and to pay all related
taxes, assessments and other charges. The lease is subordinate to, and FedEx Express s rights
thereunder could be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and the U.S.
Government. As noted above, FedEx Express is building a new regional hub in Greensboro, North
Carolina, which is scheduled to begin operations in calendar 2009.

FedEx Express has additional international sorting and freight handling facilities located at
Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan, Stansted Airport outside London, England and Pearson Airport in
Toronto, Canada. FedEx Express also has a substantial presence at airports in Hong Kong; Taiwan;
Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Frankfurt, Germany; and Miami. As noted above, in 2006, we broke
ground on a new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Southern China.
The new Asia-Pacific hub is expected to assume and expand the current activities of our existing
hub in Subic Bay, Philippines, beginning in 2009. As announced in 2008, FedEx Express intends to
construct a new sorting and handling facility in Germany at the Cologne/Bonn airport and relocate
the Frankfurt operations there, beginning in 2010.

FedEx Express owns or leases approximately 680 facilities for city station operations in the United
States. In addition, approximately 375 city stations are owned or leased throughout FedEx
Express s international network. The majority of these leases are for terms of five to ten years.
City stations serve as a sorting and distribution center for a particular city or region. We
believe that suitable alternative facilities are available in each locale on satisfactory terms, if
necessary.

outside U.S. Post Offices. As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Express also had approximately 10,500 FedEx

Home Delivery, more than 200 are co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities. Leased
facilities generally have terms of five years or less. The 30 hub facilities are strategically
located to cover the geographic area served by FedEx Ground. The hub facilities average
approximately 256,000 square feet and range in size from 31,000 to 488,000 square feet.

calendar 2009, after which the administrative office for FedEx Freight s regional LTL freight
operations will be located in Harrison. As of May 31, 2008, FedEx Freight Corporation operated
approximately 61,000 vehicles and trailers and 475 service centers, which are strategically located
to provide service to virtually all U.S. ZIP Codes. These facilities range in size from 950 to
220,400 square feet of office and dock space. CTS s headquarters are located in Greensboro, North

strip malls, office buildings or stand-alone structures and average approximately 4,000 square feet
in size.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of their business. For a description of material pending legal proceedings, see Note 17 of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents in connection with
a criminal investigation by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) into
possible anti-competitive behavior in the air freight transportation industry. In July 2007, we
received a notice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) requesting
certain information and documents in connection with the ACCC s investigation into possible
anti-competitive behavior relating to air cargo transportation services in Australia. In December
2007, we received a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents in connection with a
criminal investigation by the DOJ into possible anti-competitive behavior in the international
freight forwarding industry. In March 2008, we received an additional subpoena from the DOJ
relating to its investigation of the international freight forwarding industry. In July 2008, we
received a notice from the Korea Fair Trade Commission ( KFTC ) requesting certain information and
documents in connection with the KFTC s investigation into possible anti-competitive behavior
relating to air cargo transportation services in South Korea. The DOJ, ACCC and KFTC
investigations are ongoing. We do not believe that we have engaged in any anti-competitive
activities, and we are cooperating with these investigations.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

Effective July 14, 2008, the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation amended FedEx s Amended and

preexisting policy statement on poison pills (which is included in FedEx s Corporate Governance
Guidelines), the new bylaw requires stockholder approval for any future stockholder rights plan, or
 poison pill,  prior to or within twelve months after adoption of the poison pill. Specifically,
the bylaw provides that:

The Board must obtain stockholder approval prior to adopting a poison pill unless the
Board determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, that it would be in the best
interests of FedEx and its stockholders to adopt a poison pill without prior stockholder
approval; and 

If a poison pill is adopted by the Board without prior stockholder approval, the poison
pill shall expire within one year of adoption unless ratified by stockholders. 

The foregoing summary of the bylaw amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text
of the Amended and Restated Bylaws as adopted and effective as of July 14, 2008, which are attached
hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated by reference herein.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL SECTION 

The financial section of the FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual
Report ) consists of the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition ( MD A ), the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and Other Financial Information, all of which include
information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie
our financial results. The following MD A describes the principal factors affecting the results of
operations, liquidity, capital resources, contractual cash obligations and the critical accounting
estimates of FedEx. The discussion in the financial section should be read in conjunction with the
other sections of this Annual Report, particularly  Item 1: Business  and our detailed discussion
of risk factors included in this MD A.

ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  

Our MD A is comprised of three major sections: Results of Operations, Financial Condition and
Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:

Results of Operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2008 results compared to
2007, and 2007 results compared to 2006. This section also includes a discussion of key
actions and events that impacted our results, as well as a discussion of our outlook for 2009. 

The overview is followed by a financial summary and analysis (including a discussion of
both historical operating results and our outlook for 2009) for each of our reportable
transportation segments. 

Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity,
capital resources and contractual cash obligations, including a discussion of our cash flow
statements and our financial commitments. 

We conclude with a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are
important to understanding certain of the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in
our reported financial results. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

We provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies
competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected
FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies include Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx
Express ), the world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc.
( FedEx Ground ), a leading provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight
Corporation, a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. Our FedEx
Services segment provides customer-facing sales, marketing and information technology support, as
well as retail access for customers through FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ),
formerly FedEx Kinko s, primarily for the benefit of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. These
companies represent our major service lines and form the core of our reportable segments. See
 Reportable Segments  for further discussion and refer to  Item 1: Business  for a more detailed
description of each of our operating companies.

Table of Contents   

The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:

the overall customer demand for our various services; 

the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by
our average daily volume and shipment weight; 

the mix of services purchased by our customers; 

the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (average price per
shipment or pound or average price per hundredweight for FedEx Freight LTL Group shipments); 

our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to
match shifting volume levels; and 

the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental
fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. 

The majority of our operating expenses are directly impacted by revenue and volume levels.
Accordingly, we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent
with the change in revenues and volume. The following discussion of operating expenses describes
the key drivers impacting expense trends beyond changes in revenues and volume.

Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2008 or
ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. References to our
transportation segments include, collectively, our FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight
segments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  

The following table compares revenues, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted
earnings per share (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31:

(1)  
       
     Operating expenses include a charge of approximately $891 million ($696 million,
net of tax, or $2.23 per diluted share), predominantly related to noncash impairment charges
associated with the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name and goodwill resulting
from the Kinko s acquisition (described below). 

(2)  
       
     Operating expenses include a $143 million charge at FedEx Express associated with
upfront compensation and benefits under the new labor contract with our pilots, which was ratified
in October 2006. The impact of this new contract on second quarter net income was approximately
$78 million net of tax, or $0.25 per diluted share. 

(3)  
       
     Operating expenses include a $79 million ($49 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per
diluted share) charge to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases, predominantly at FedEx
Express. 

The following table shows changes in revenues and operating income by reportable segment for 2008
compared to 2007, and 2007 compared to 2006 (in millions):

(1)  
       
     FedEx Express 2007 operating expenses include a $143 million charge associated with upfront compensation
and benefits under the new pilot labor contract and 2006 operating expenses include a $75 million charge to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases. 

(2)  
       
     FedEx Freight segment results include the results of FedEx National LTL from the date of its acquisition on September 3, 2006. 

(3)  
       
     FedEx Services segment operating expenses include a charge of approximately $891 million, predominantly
related to noncash impairment charges associated with the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name and goodwill resulting from the Kinko s acquisition (described below).

The
following graphs for our transportation segments show our average
cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon and the year-over-year
percentage increase in total fuel expense for the years ended May 31:

Overview  

Our results for 2008 reflect a difficult year, as the combination of record high fuel prices and
the weak U.S. economy significantly impacted our profitability. We believe persistently higher
fuel prices and the related impact on our fuel surcharges are reducing demand for our services,
particularly U.S. domestic express package and LTL freight services, and are pressuring overall
yield growth across our transportation segments. Also, these factors are affecting our ability to
cover inflation in our overall operating costs and contributing to a
customer shift to lower-yielding services. Increased net operating costs at FedEx Office associated with reduced copy and
print revenue and higher expenses for store expansion and service improvement activities also
contributed to the decline in operating results for 2008. Significantly lower variable incentive
compensation (lower by approximately $220 million) and reduced retirement plans costs (reduced by
$82 million), combined with cost containment initiatives, partially mitigated the impact of higher
net fuel costs and the weak U.S. economy on our 2008 overall results.

In addition, our operating results for 2008 include a fourth quarter charge of approximately $891
million ($696 million, net of tax, or $2.23 per diluted share), predominantly related to noncash
impairment charges associated with the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name and
goodwill resulting from the Kinko s acquisition (described below).

Revenue  

Revenue growth for 2008 was primarily attributable to continued growth in international services at
FedEx Express, increases in FedEx Express U.S. domestic package yields and volume growth at FedEx
Ground. Higher fuel surcharges continue to be the key driver of increased yields in our
transportation segments. Additionally, FedEx Express international yields benefited from favorable
currency exchange rates. Revenue growth for 2008 also improved due to a full year of operations
for businesses acquired in 2007 at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. Revenue growth during 2008 was
partially offset by reduced U.S. domestic express volumes as a result of the ongoing weak U.S.
economy. The impact of the weak U.S. economy became progressively worse during the year and drove
U.S. domestic express shipping volumes to pre-2000 levels during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Revenue growth in 2007 was due to FedEx Ground package volume growth and growth in FedEx Express
International Priority ( IP ) services. Our 2007 revenues also reflected the acquisition of FedEx
National LTL (formerly known as Watkins Motor Lines), which added approximately $760 million to
2007 revenue. Revenue growth in 2007 was slightly offset by declines in copy revenues at FedEx
Office.

Table of Contents   

Operating Income  

The following table compares operating expenses and operating income as a percent of revenue for
the years ended May 31:

Operating income and operating margin declined during 2008, as the weak U.S. economy and
substantially higher fuel costs pressured volume growth at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. The
noncash impairment charges at FedEx Office also negatively affected operating margins in 2008.
Fuel expenses increased approximately 30% during 2008, primarily due to an increase in the average
price per gallon of fuel. Fuel surcharges were not sufficient to offset incremental fuel costs for
2008, based on a static analysis of the impact to operating income of year-over-year changes in
fuel prices compared to changes in fuel surcharges. This analysis considers the estimated benefits
of the reduction in fuel surcharges included in the base rates charged for FedEx Express services.
However, this analysis does not consider several other factors, including the sensitivity of demand
to changes in price and shifts by our customers to lower-yielding services. Though fluctuations in
fuel surcharge rates can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the
many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield.
Additional components include the mix of services purchased, the base price and other extra service
charges we obtain for these services and the level of pricing discounts offered. In order to
provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth,
we have included the comparative fuel surcharge rates in effect for 2008, 2007 and 2006 in the
accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments.

Operating income in 2008 was also negatively impacted by increased net operating costs at FedEx
Office and expansion of our domestic express services in China. Higher purchased transportation
expenses at FedEx Ground, primarily due to costs associated with independent contractor incentive
programs and higher rates paid to our contractors (including higher fuel supplement costs), also
had a negative impact
on 2008 results. Other operating expenses increased during 2008 primarily due to the full-year
inclusion of our 2007 business acquisitions, including the consolidation of the results of our
China joint venture at FedEx Express, and higher legal, consulting and insurance costs at FedEx
Ground. Lower variable incentive compensation and reduced retirement plans costs, combined with
cost containment activities, partially mitigated the impact of higher net fuel costs and the weak
U.S. economy on our overall results for 2008.

43 

Table of Contents   

Operating income increased in 2007, as revenue growth at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground more than
offset reduced profitability at the FedEx Freight segment and increased net operating costs at
FedEx Office. Operating margin was flat in 2007 due to slower economic growth, the negative impact
of higher salaries and benefits (primarily as a result of the new labor contract with our pilots)
and the timing of adjustments to our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express, as well as operating losses
at FedEx National LTL. Soft volumes in the LTL sector and expenses to integrate the FedEx National
LTL network negatively impacted the performance of the FedEx Freight segment in 2007.

Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2007 as a result of the new labor contract for the
pilots of FedEx Express and the FedEx National LTL acquisition. The impacts of expensing stock
options commencing in 2007 and higher retirement plan costs were largely offset by lower incentive
compensation. Purchased transportation costs increased in 2007 due to FedEx Ground volume growth,
the FedEx National LTL acquisition and IP package volume growth.

Impairment Charges  

Our operating results for 2008 include a charge of approximately $891 million ($696 million, net of
tax, or $2.23 per diluted share) recorded during the fourth quarter, predominantly related to
noncash impairment charges associated with the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s trade
name and goodwill resulting from the Kinko s acquisition.

The
components of the charge include the following (in millions):

During the fourth quarter we decided to change the name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office. The
impairment of the Kinko s trade name was due to the decision to minimize the use of the Kinko s
trade name and rebrand our centers over the next several years. We believe the FedEx Office name
better describes the wide range of services available at our retail centers and takes full
advantage of the FedEx brand. The goodwill impairment charge was related to the impairment of our
recorded goodwill, reflecting a decline in its current fair value in light of economic conditions,
the unit s recent and forecasted financial performance and the decision to reduce the rate of store
expansion. These impairment charges are included in operating expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The charges are included in the results of the FedEx Services
segment and were not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charges were unrelated to the
core performance of these businesses.

For additional information concerning the trade name and goodwill impairment charges, see Note 4 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates section of
this MD A.

Other Income and Expense  

Net interest expense decreased $1 million during 2008 primarily due to decreased interest expense
related to lower debt balances and increased capitalized interest. The decrease in interest
expense was partially offset by decreased interest income due to lower cash balances. Net interest
expense decreased $51 million during 2007 primarily due to increased interest income earned on
higher cash balances.

Table of Contents   

Income Taxes  

Our effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2008, 37.3% in 2007 and 37.7% in 2006. Our 2008 tax rate
increased primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for
income tax purposes. Our 2007 tax rate was favorably impacted by the conclusion of various state
and federal tax audits and appeals. This favorable impact was partially offset by tax charges
incurred as a result of a reorganization in Asia associated with our acquisition in China
(described below). For 2009, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 38%. The actual
rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating
income.

Business Acquisitions  

During 2007, we made the following business acquisitions:

Our acquisition of FedEx National LTL extended our service offerings to the long-haul LTL freight
sector. The acquisition of FedEx U.K. has allowed us to establish a
domestic service in the United Kingdom and better serve the U.K.
international market,
while the DTW Group acquisition converted our joint venture with DTW Group into a wholly owned
subsidiary and has increased our presence in China in the
international market and established our presence in the domestic market.
During 2007, we also made other immaterial acquisitions that are not presented in the table above.

We paid the purchase price for these acquisitions from available cash balances, which included the
net proceeds from our $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering completed during 2007. See Note 6
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this debt offering.

See Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about
these acquisitions.

Employees
Under Collective Bargaining Arrangements  

The pilots of FedEx Express, who represent a small percentage of our total employees, are employed
under a collective bargaining agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, the pilots ratified a
new four-year labor contract that included signing bonuses and other upfront compensation of
approximately $143 million, as well as pay increases and other benefit enhancements. These costs
were partially mitigated by reductions in the variable incentive compensation of our other
employees. The effect of this new agreement on second quarter 2007 net income was approximately
$78 million net of tax, or $0.25 per diluted share.

Lease Accounting Charge  

Our results for 2006 included a noncash charge of $79 million ($49 million net of tax, or $0.16 per
diluted share) to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases, predominantly at FedEx
Express. This charge, which included the impact on prior years, related primarily to rent
escalations in on-airport facility leases that were not being recognized appropriately.

45 

Table of Contents   

Outlook  

Our comparisons to 2008 and expectations for 2009 below exclude the impact of the noncash
impairment charges described above.

We anticipate the difficult economic environment that impacted our profitability in 2008 will
continue in 2009, as we expect no significant improvement in the U.S. economy, at least for the
near term. In fact, the negative consequences of record oil prices on global growth will likely
amplify in coming quarters. Therefore, we expect nominal base revenue growth in 2009, as these
factors will continue to pressure yields and volumes in both package and freight services,
especially in our U.S. domestic services at FedEx Express. Persistently high energy costs will
continue to dampen our growth potential throughout 2009 despite our continued cost containment
initiatives and reductions in variable incentive compensation. These factors, combined with higher
purchased transportation costs at FedEx Ground, are expected to result in reduced earnings in 2009.
We will continue to have cost containment initiatives in place across all segments in 2009,
including controlling discretionary spending and limiting staffing additions. If the economic
downturn becomes even more pronounced, additional actions will be taken to control costs. However,
we will not compromise our outstanding service levels or take actions that negatively impact the
customer experience in exchange for short-term cost reductions.

In light of current economic conditions, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures for 2008
from an initial budget of $3.5 billion to $2.9 billion in actual expenditures. Our capital
expenditures for 2009 are expected to approximate 2008 levels, as we balance the need to control
spending with the opportunity to make investments with high returns, such as in substantially more
fuel-efficient Boeing 757 and Boeing 777 aircraft. Moreover, we will continue to invest in
critical long-term strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks and broadening our
service offerings to position us for stronger growth in better economic times. However, we could
significantly reduce 2009 capital expenditures should conditions worsen. For additional details on
key 2009 capital projects, refer to the Liquidity Outlook section of this MD A.

All of our businesses operate in a competitive pricing environment, exacerbated by continuing
volatile fuel prices. Historically, our fuel surcharges have largely been sufficient to offset
incremental fuel costs; however, volatility in fuel costs, as seen in the rapidly rising price of
oil in 2008, may impact earnings because adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual
fuel prices paid. Therefore, the trailing impact of adjustments to our fuel surcharges can
significantly affect our earnings in the short-term.

As described in Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the  Independent
Contractor Matters  section of our FedEx Ground segment MD A, we are involved in a number of
litigation matters and other proceedings that challenge the status of FedEx Ground s
owner-operators as independent contractors. FedEx Ground anticipates continuing changes to its
relationships with its contractors. The nature, timing and amount of any changes are dependent on
the outcome of numerous future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact of any
such changes or a meaningful range of potential outcomes, although they could be material.
However, we do not believe that any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably
grow our FedEx Ground business.

See  Risk Factors  for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could
materially affect our future performance.

46 

Table of Contents   

Seasonality of Business  

Our businesses are seasonal in nature. Seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenues and
earnings. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in
late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks
in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal
quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically
experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping
period for FedEx Ground, while late December, June and July are the slowest periods. For the FedEx
Freight LTL Group, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December,
January and February are the slowest periods. For FedEx Office, the summer months are normally the
slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also
be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly in our third fiscal quarter.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and
the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting
pronouncements are relevant to the readers of our financial statements.

On June 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No.
( FIN ) 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  This interpretation establishes new
standards for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative effect of adopting
FIN 48 was immaterial. For additional information on the impact of adoption of FIN 48, refer to
Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On May 31, 2007, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) 158,  Employers 
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.  SFAS 158 requires
recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income
( AOCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. The
funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the
projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) of the plan. The adoption of SFAS
158 resulted in a $982 million charge to shareholders  equity at May 31, 2007 through AOCI. At May 31, 2008, under the provisions of SFAS
158, we recorded an increase to equity of $469 million (net of
tax) based on a $1 billion improvement in the
funded status of our retirement plans since May 31, 2007.

Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide
with the sponsor s year end. We currently use a February 28 (February 29 in 2008) measurement date
for our plans; therefore, this standard will require us to change our measurement date to May 31
(beginning in
2009). We are required to make our transition election in the first quarter of 2009 and plan to
elect the two-measurement approach as our transition method. Under the two-measurement approach,
we complete two actuarial measurements, one at February 29, 2008 and the other at June 1, 2008.
For the transition period from February 29, 2008 through June 1, 2008, we will record the net
periodic benefit cost, net of tax, as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and the
actuarial gains and losses, net of tax, as an adjustment to AOCI in the first quarter of 2009. The
impact of adopting the measurement date provision on our financial statements is not expected to be
material to our financial position or results of operations, but will reduce our 2009 pension and
retiree medical expense by approximately $87 million under the two-measurement approach due to an
increase in the discount rate and higher plan assets. For additional information on the adoption
of SFAS 158 and these changes, see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD A.

47 

Table of Contents   

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,  Fair Value Measurements,  which provides a common
definition of fair value, establishes a uniform framework for measuring fair value and requires
expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The requirements of SFAS 157 are to be applied
prospectively, and we anticipate that the primary impact of the standard to us will be related to
the measurement of fair value in our recurring impairment test calculations (such as measurements
of our recorded goodwill). SFAS 157 is effective for us beginning on June 1, 2008; however, the
FASB approved a one-year deferral of the adoption of the standard as it relates to non-financial
assets and liabilities with the issuance in February 2008 of FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2,
 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157.  We do not presently hold any financial assets or
liabilities that would require recognition under SFAS 157 other than investments held by our
pension plans. In addition, the FASB has excluded leases from the scope of SFAS 157. We
anticipate that this standard will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results
of operations upon adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R,  Business Combinations,  and SFAS 160,  Accounting and
Reporting Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.
51.  These new standards significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business
combination transactions and noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority
interests) in consolidated financial statements. The key aspects of SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 include
requiring the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishing the acquisition-date fair value
as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requiring the
expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs. Both standards are effective for us
beginning June 1, 2009 (fiscal 2010) and are applicable only to transactions occurring after the
effective date.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  

FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with
FedEx Services, form the core of our reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the
following businesses:

FedEx Express Segment 

FedEx Express (express transportation) 

FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services) 

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery) 

FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator) 

FedEx Freight Segment 

FedEx Freight LTL Group: 

FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight transportation) 

FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight transportation) 

FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation) 

Caribbean Transportation Services (airfreight forwarding) 

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services (sales, marketing and information technology functions) 

FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance) 

FedEx Customer Information Services ( FCIS ) (customer service, billing and collections) 

FedEx Global Supply Chain Services (logistics services) 

48 

Table of Contents   

FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT  

The FedEx
Services segment includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing and information
technology support; FCIS, which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground; FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, which provides a range of
logistics services to our customers; and FedEx Office.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to change the name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office.
We believe the FedEx Office name better describes the wide range of services available at our
retail centers and takes full advantage of the FedEx brand.

During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Office was reorganized as a part of the FedEx Services
segment. FedEx Office provides retail access to our customers for our package transportation
businesses and an array of document and business services. FedEx Services provides access to
customers through digital channels such as fedex.com. Under FedEx Services, FedEx Office benefits
from the full range of resources and expertise of FedEx Services to continue to enhance the
customer experience, provide greater, more convenient access to the portfolio of services at FedEx,
and increase revenues through our retail network. As part of this reorganization, we are pursuing
synergies in sales, marketing, information technology and administrative areas.

With this reorganization, the FedEx Services segment became a reportable segment. Prior year
amounts have been revised to conform to the current year segment presentation. FedEx Office
continues to be treated as a reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.

Effective June 1, 2006, we moved FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc., the results of which were
previously reported in the FedEx Ground segment, into a new subsidiary of FedEx Services named
FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, Inc. The net operating costs of this entity are allocated to
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. Prior year amounts were not reclassified to conform to the 2007
segment presentation, as financial results were materially comparable.

The costs of the sales, marketing and information technology support provided by FedEx Services and
the customer service functions of FCIS, together with the normal, ongoing net operating costs of
FedEx Global Supply Chain Services and FedEx Office, are allocated primarily to the FedEx Express
and FedEx Ground segments based on metrics such as relative revenues or estimated services
provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. The
$891 million fourth quarter charge predominantly associated with the noncash impairment charges
for the Kinko s trade name and goodwill was not allocated to the FedEx Express or FedEx Ground
segments, as it was unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

FedEx Services segment revenues, which reflect the operations of FedEx Office and FedEx Global
Supply Chain Services, increased slightly during 2008. Revenue generated from new locations and
higher package acceptance fees more than offset declines in copy revenues at FedEx Office for 2008.
The allocated net operating costs of FedEx Office increased during 2008 due to declines in copy revenues, as well
as higher expenses associated with store expansion, advertising and
promotions, and service
improvement activities. Increased capital expenditures for the FedEx Services segment are
primarily associated with information technology facility expansion at FedEx Services and store
expansion activities at FedEx
Office. FedEx Office opened 318 new centers during 2008.

OTHER INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS  

Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx
companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated
rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing
segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment
revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated results and are not separately identified
in the following segment information, as the amounts are not material.

The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial
summaries of our transportation segments includes the allocations from the FedEx Services segment
to the respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes
allocations for administrative services provided between operating companies and certain other
costs such as corporate management fees related to services received for general corporate
oversight, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. Management
evaluates transportation segment financial performance based on operating income.

FedEx Express Segment Revenues  

FedEx Express revenues increased 8% in 2008, primarily due to increases in fuel surcharges, growth
in IP volume and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Revenue increases during 2008
were partially offset by decreased volumes in U.S. domestic package and freight services, as the
weak U.S. economy and persistently higher fuel prices and the related impact on our fuel surcharges
have restrained demand for these services. These factors drove U.S. domestic shipping levels to
pre-2000 volumes during the fourth quarter of 2008.

52 

Table of Contents   

The increase in composite package yield in 2008 was driven by increases in IP and U.S. domestic
yields, partially offset by decreased international domestic yield. IP yield increased 7% in 2008,
primarily due to favorable exchange rates, higher fuel surcharges and increases in package weights.
U.S. domestic yield increased 4% in 2008 primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and general rate
increases. International domestic yield decreased 18% during 2008 as a result of the inclusion of
lower-yielding services from the companies acquired in 2007. Composite freight yield increased in
2008 due to the impact of changes in service mix, higher fuel surcharges and favorable exchange
rates.

IP volume growth during 2008 resulted from increased demand in Asia, U.S. outbound and Europe.
Increased international domestic volumes during 2008 were driven by business acquisitions in the
second half of 2007. U.S. domestic package and freight volumes decreased during 2008, as the
ongoing weak U.S. economy and rising fuel prices continued to negatively impact demand for these
services.

Revenue growth in 2007 was driven by IP revenues as a result of yield improvements across all
regions and volume growth resulting from increased demand in U.S. outbound, Asia and Europe. Also
contributing to revenue growth in 2007 were increases in international domestic revenues (primarily
due to our acquisition of FedEx U.K.) and increases in freight revenues due to higher U.S. and
international priority freight volumes. U.S. domestic package revenues increased as a result of
yield improvements, partially offset by a decrease in volumes resulting from the moderating growth
rate of the U.S. economy.

IP yield increased during 2007 as a result of favorable exchange rates, higher package weights and
an increase in the average rate per pound. U.S. domestic composite yield increases in 2007 were
due to an increase in the average rate per pound, partially offset by changes in product mix and
lower package weights. U.S. freight yield increased in 2007 due to an increase in the average rate
per pound and higher fuel surcharges.

Our fuel surcharges are indexed to the spot price for jet fuel. Using this index, the U.S.
domestic and outbound fuel surcharge and the international fuel surcharges ranged as follows, for
the years ended May 31:

FedEx Express Segment Operating Income  

The following table compares operating expenses and operating income as a percent of revenue for
the years ended May 31:

(1)  
       
     Includes a $143 million charge for signing bonuses and other upfront
compensation associated with the new four-year labor contract with our pilots (0.6% of revenue). 

(2)  
       
     Includes a $75 million one-time, noncash charge to adjust the accounting
for certain facility leases (0.4% of revenue). 

Operating results for 2008 were negatively impacted by record high fuel prices, the continued weak
U.S. economy and our continued investment in domestic express services in China. However, revenue
growth in IP services, reduced retirement plan costs, the favorable impact of foreign currency
exchange rates and lower variable incentive compensation partially offset the impact of these
factors on operating income during 2008.

Fuel costs increased 28% in 2008 due to an increase in the average price per gallon of fuel.
Although fuel costs increased significantly during 2008, fuel surcharges were sufficient to offset
incremental fuel costs, based on a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in fuel prices
compared to changes in fuel surcharges. This analysis considers the estimated benefits of the
reduction in fuel surcharges included in
the base rates charged for FedEx Express services. However, we believe persistently higher fuel
prices and the related impact on our fuel surcharges are reducing demand for our services and
pressuring overall yield growth. These factors are also affecting our ability to cover inflation
in our operating costs and contributing to a customer shift to lower-yielding services.

Other operating expenses increased 15% during 2008 principally due to the inclusion of our 2007
business acquisitions, including the full consolidation of the results of our China joint venture.
Also contributing to the increase in other operating expenses in 2008 was the inclusion of an
operating gain in 2007 related to the Airbus contract settlement agreement described below.
Purchased transportation costs increased 10% in 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of our 2007
business acquisitions, the impact of higher fuel costs and IP volume growth, which requires a
higher utilization of contract pickup and delivery services. These increases in purchased
transportation costs were partially offset by the elimination of payments by us for pickup and
delivery services provided by our former China joint venture partner, as we acquired this business
in the second half of 2007. The 10% increase in depreciation expense during 2008 was principally
due to aircraft purchases and our 2007 business acquisitions. Intercompany charges increased 4%
during 2008 primarily due to increased net operating costs at FedEx Office associated with declines
in copy revenues, as well as higher expenses associated with store expansion, advertising and
promotions, and service improvement activities. This increase was partially offset by lower
allocated fees from FedEx Services due to cost containment activities.

54 

Table of Contents   

Operating income and operating margin increased in 2007, despite slower overall revenue growth.
Increases in operating income and margin in 2007 resulted from growth in IP services and were
partially offset by costs associated with the ratification of a new labor contract with our pilots
in October 2006. These costs included signing bonuses and other upfront compensation of $143
million, as well as pay increases and other benefit enhancements, which were mitigated by
reductions in the variable incentive compensation for our other employees. Year-over-year results
in 2007 were positively affected by a $75 million charge in 2006 to adjust the accounting for
certain facility leases.

Fuel costs increased during 2007 due to an increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. Fuel
surcharges did not offset the effect of higher fuel costs on our year-over-year operating results
for 2007, due to the timing lag that exists between when we purchase fuel and when our fuel
surcharges are adjusted, based on a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in fuel prices
compared to changes in fuel surcharges.

Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2007 primarily as a result of the new labor contract
with our pilots. Purchased transportation costs increased 13% in 2007 due to IP volume growth,
which requires a higher utilization of contract pickup and delivery services and an increase in the
cost of purchased transportation. Maintenance and repairs increased 7% in 2007 primarily due to
higher aircraft maintenance expenses for various airframes and Airbus A300 engines. The 5%
decrease in rentals and landing fees in 2007 was attributable to the one-time adjustment for leases
in 2006 described above. Intercompany charges increased 37% in 2007 due to allocations as a result
of moving the FCIS organization from FedEx Express to FedEx Services in 2007. The costs associated
with the FCIS organization in 2006 were of a comparable amount but were reported in individual
operating expense captions.

During 2007, we terminated our agreement with Airbus for the purchase of A380 aircraft and in March
2007 entered into a separate settlement agreement with Airbus that, among other things, provides us
with credit memoranda applicable to the purchase of goods and services in the future. The net
impact of this settlement was immaterial to our 2007 results and was recorded as an operating gain
during the fourth quarter of 2007.

FedEx Express Segment Outlook  

We expect limited base revenue growth at FedEx Express in 2009, as we expect no significant
improvement in the U.S. economy with continued high oil prices. These factors will continue to
pressure yields and volumes in both U.S. domestic package and freight services. We expect U.S.
domestic shipping volumes to remain at the pre-2000 levels experienced in the fourth quarter of
2008. We expect that the majority of the revenue increase in 2009 will be led by IP services, as
we continue to focus on growing our service offerings, particularly
in China and Europe, and benefit from increased demand for U.S. goods
due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Our international
domestic revenue is projected to increase in 2009 due to the continued expansion of our China
domestic service as well as increases in our Canadian domestic package services.

FedEx Express segment operating income and operating margin are expected to decline in 2009,
primarily due to lower U.S. domestic package and freight volumes, as high energy costs will dampen
our growth potential throughout 2009 despite our continued cost containment initiatives. Capital
expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to be relatively flat in 2009, as we balance the need to
control spending with the opportunity to make investments with high returns, such as substantially
more  fuel-efficient aircraft. Our aircraft-related capital outlays include the more
fuel-efficient Boeing 757s, the first of which enter revenue service in 2009, and the new Boeing
777s, the first of which enter revenue service in 2010. These aircraft capital expenditures are
necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to support projected long-term
international volume growth. However, we may temporarily ground certain aircraft due to excess
capacity in the current economic environment. The new Asia-Pacific hub in Guangzhou, China is
planned to be operational in 2009.

FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT  

The following table compares revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin
(dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the
years ended May 31:

FedEx Ground Segment Revenues  

FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 12% during 2008 due to volume and yield growth. Volume
growth at FedEx Ground resulted from market share gains and the customer appeal of our
cost-effective alternative to overnight air delivery services. Average daily volumes at FedEx
Ground increased 8% during 2008 due to increased commercial business and the continued growth of
our FedEx Home Delivery service. Yield improvement during 2008 was primarily due to the impact of
general rate increases, higher extra service revenue (primarily through our residential, additional
handling and large package surcharges) and higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by higher
customer discounts and a lower average weight and zone per package.

FedEx SmartPost picks up shipments from customers and delivers them to various points within the
United States Postal Service ( USPS ) network for final delivery. FedEx SmartPost revenue and
yield represent the amount charged to customers net of postage paid to the USPS.

56 

Table of Contents   

Revenues increased during 2007 due to strong volume growth. Average daily volumes at FedEx Ground
rose 11% because of increased commercial business and the continued growth of our FedEx Home
Delivery service. Yield improvement during 2007 was primarily due to the impact of general rate
increases and higher extra service revenues, primarily on our residential services. This yield
increase was partially offset by higher customer discounts and a lower average weight and zone per
package. Additionally, revenue at FedEx SmartPost increased significantly in 2007 due to increased
market share, as a major competitor exited this market in 2006, enabling significant growth in the
customer base and related volumes.

The FedEx Ground fuel surcharge is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway
average prices for a gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. Our fuel
surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:

FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income  

The following table compares operating expenses and operating income as a percent of revenue for
the years ended May 31:

FedEx Ground segment operating income decreased 10% during 2008, as revenue growth was more than
offset by higher independent contractor-related costs, the net impact of increased fuel costs,
costs associated with our multi-year capacity expansion plan, higher intercompany charges and
higher legal costs (including fees paid to external counsel, settlement costs and loss accruals).
However, lower variable incentive compensation partially offset the net impact of these factors on
operating income during 2008.

Fuel costs increased 72% during 2008 primarily due to a significant increase in the average price
per gallon of fuel. Fuel surcharges were not sufficient to offset the effect of fuel costs on our
year-over-year operating results for 2008, due to the timing lag that exists between when we
purchase fuel and when our indexed fuel surcharges automatically adjust. Purchased transportation
costs increased 16% in 2008 as a result of higher rates paid to our independent contractors,
increased fuel expenses and costs associated with our independent contractor programs (described
below).

57 

Table of Contents   

Intercompany charges increased 16% during 2008 primarily due to increased net operating
costs at FedEx Office associated with declines in copy revenues, as well as higher expenses
associated with store expansion, advertising and promotions and service improvement activities. In
addition, higher allocated sales and marketing and customer service costs from FedEx Services
contributed to the increase in intercompany charges for 2008. Other operating expenses increased
19% during 2008, primarily due to higher legal, consulting and insurance costs. Depreciation
expense and rent expense increased 14% in 2008 primarily due to higher spending on material
handling equipment and facilities associated with our multi-year capacity expansion plan.

The increase in FedEx Ground segment operating income during 2007 was principally due to revenue
growth and improved results at FedEx SmartPost. Operating margin increased only slightly in 2007,
as revenue growth was partially offset by increased purchased transportation costs, increased legal
costs and higher depreciation and rent expense associated with network expansion.

Purchased transportation increased in 2007 primarily due to volume growth and higher rates paid to
our independent contractors, including fuel supplements. Our fuel surcharge was sufficient to
offset the effect of higher fuel costs on our 2007 operating results, based on a static analysis of
the year-over-year changes
in fuel prices compared to changes in the fuel surcharge. Other operating expenses increased in
2007 primarily due to increased legal costs. Depreciation expense increased 20% and rent expense
increased 25% principally due to higher spending on material handling and scanning equipment and
facilities associated with our multi-year network expansion.

Independent Contractor Matters  

FedEx Ground faces increased regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to its independent
contractors. As part of its operations, FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with
contractors that, among other things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced
regulatory and other compliance by our contractors. During the second quarter of 2008, FedEx
Ground announced a nationwide program, which provides greater
incentives to certain of its contractors who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. In addition, FedEx Ground
offered special incentives to encourage California-based single-route contractors to transform
their operations into multiple-route businesses or sell their routes to others. Virtually all
California-based single-route contractors accepted the incentives and completed the required
actions by May 31, 2008. Furthermore, as of May 31, 2008 nearly 60% of all service areas
nationwide are supported by multiple-route contractors.

FedEx
Ground is involved in numerous purported or certified class-action lawsuits, state tax and other
administrative proceedings and Internal Revenue Service audits that claim the company s
owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. For a
description of these proceedings, see Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

FedEx Ground Segment Outlook  

We expect the FedEx Ground segment to have continued revenue growth in 2009, led by increased
commercial business and the continued growth of our FedEx Home Delivery service. FedEx SmartPost
volumes are also expected to grow, due to market share gains and improved service levels.
Yields for all services at FedEx Ground are expected to improve in 2009 as a result of increases
in list prices and fuel surcharges.

58 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Ground segment operating margin in 2009 is expected to decrease slightly due to rising fuel
prices and increased purchased transportation costs, despite continued cost containment
initiatives. Purchased transportation costs are expected to increase in 2009 due to ongoing
enhancements to our independent contractor model, and higher incentives and rates paid to our
independent contractors. Capital spending is expected to remain relatively flat in 2009, with the
majority of our spending resulting from our continued comprehensive network expansion and
productivity-enhancing technologies. We are committed to investing in the FedEx Ground network
because of the long-term benefits we will experience from these investments.

We will continue to vigorously defend various attacks against our independent contractor model and
incur ongoing legal costs as a part of this process. While we believe that FedEx Ground s owner
operators are properly classified as independent contractors, it is reasonably possible that we
could incur a material loss in connection with one or more of these matters or be required to make
additional changes to our contractor model. However, we do not believe that any such charges will
impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business.

FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT  

The following table shows revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin
(dollars in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31:

(1)  
       
     Includes the results of FedEx National LTL from the date of its acquisition on September 3, 2006. 

FedEx Freight Segment Revenues  

FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 8% during 2008 primarily due to the full-year inclusion of
the FedEx National LTL acquisition. LTL yield increased 5% during 2008, reflecting higher yields
from longer-haul FedEx National LTL shipments, higher fuel surcharges (despite the rate reduction
described below) and the impact of the January 2008 general rate increase. Average daily LTL
shipments grew 2% in 2008, reflecting the full-year inclusion of FedEx National LTL. During the
second half of 2008, average daily LTL shipments improved sequentially despite the weak U.S.
economy and rising fuel costs that limited demand throughout the entire LTL industry.

59 

Table of Contents   

FedEx Freight segment revenues increased in 2007 primarily as a result of the acquisition of FedEx
National LTL. Average daily LTL shipments (excluding FedEx National LTL) grew slightly in 2007 due
to increased demand for our regional and interregional services. This growth rate moderated
throughout the year, however, with year-over-year declines in the second half of 2007. LTL yield
growth was due to higher yields from longer-haul FedEx National LTL shipments, higher rates and
favorable contract renewals.

During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Freight reduced its standard regional LTL fuel surcharge by
25% and FedEx National LTL reduced its standard LTL fuel surcharge to levels commensurate with
FedEx Freight. The indexed LTL fuel surcharge is based on the average of the national U.S.
on-highway average prices for a gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy.
The indexed LTL fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:

FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income  

The following table compares operating expenses and operating income as a percent of revenue for
the years ended May 31:

FedEx Freight segment operating income and operating margin decreased substantially in 2008
primarily due to the net impact of higher fuel costs and the fuel surcharge rate reduction
described above, along with higher purchased transportation costs due to increased utilization of
and rates paid to third party transportation providers. Lower variable incentive compensation
partially offset the net impact of these factors on operating income during 2008.

60 

Table of Contents   
 
 The full-year inclusion of FedEx National LTL in our results impacted the 2008 comparability of all
our operating expenses. Fuel costs increased 30% during 2008 due to an increase in the average
price per gallon of diesel fuel, which also increased rates paid to our third-party transportation
providers. Fuel surcharges were not sufficient to offset incremental fuel costs for 2008, based on
a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to changes in fuel
surcharges. Purchased transportation costs increased 25% in 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of
FedEx National LTL, which uses a higher proportion of these services, and higher rates paid to our
third-party transportation providers. Including incremental costs from FedEx National LTL,
depreciation expense increased 16% during 2008 due to investments in information technology and
equipment purchased to support ongoing replacement requirements and long-term volume growth.
Intercompany charges increased 33% during 2008 primarily due to higher allocated marketing and
information technology costs from FedEx Services.

FedEx Freight segment operating income decreased during 2007 due to operating losses at FedEx
National LTL, which resulted from softening volumes and ongoing expenses to integrate its network.
Along with incremental costs from FedEx National LTL (including amortization of acquired intangible
assets), depreciation expense increased due to prior-year purchases of vehicles and other operating
equipment to support volume growth. Purchased transportation increased due to higher rates paid to
our third-party transportation providers and the utilization of third-party providers at FedEx
National LTL. While fuel costs increased in 2007, our fuel surcharge was more than sufficient to
offset the effect of higher fuel costs, based on a static analysis of the year-over-year changes in
fuel prices compared to changes in the fuel surcharge.

FedEx Freight Segment Outlook  

We expect the FedEx Freight segment to have revenue growth resulting from market share gains in
2009, despite the continued contraction of the LTL industry resulting from the weak U.S. economy
and high oil prices. Our revenue growth in 2009 is expected to approximate revenue growth levels
in 2008. We expect operating income and operating margin growth to be constrained in 2009 due to
the continued weak U.S. economy and the increasingly competitive LTL pricing environment. We plan
to continue to integrate our LTL businesses in 2009, which will lead to improved synergies and cost
savings. As part of that process, we plan to close the San Jose, California office in calendar
2009, after which the administrative office for FedEx Freight s regional LTL freight operations
will be located in Harrison, Arkansas. No material costs are anticipated in connection with this
action. Capital spending is expected to remain relatively flat in 2009, with the majority of our
spending resulting from investments in revenue equipment and our continued investment in technology
to improve productivity and to meet our customers  needs.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

LIQUIDITY  

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.539 billion at May 31, 2008, compared to $1.569 billion at May
31, 2007 and $1.937 billion at May 31, 2006. The following table provides a summary of our cash
flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions):

Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  Cash flows from operating activities decreased $79 million
in 2008 primarily due to higher operating costs, particularly fuel and purchased transportation,
partially offset by year-over-year reductions in income tax payments. Noncash charges and credits
increased in 2008 due to the impairment charges discussed above. Cash flows from operating
activities decreased $113 million in 2007 primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of
$184 million, partially offset by increased earnings. During 2008, we made tax-deductible voluntary
contributions to our principal U.S. domestic pension plans of $479 million, compared to $482
million during 2007 and $456 million during 2006.

Cash Used in Investing Activities.  Capital expenditures during 2008 were 2% higher largely due to
planned expenditures for facility expansion at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. During 2007, $1.3
billion of cash was used for the FedEx National LTL, FedEx U.K., DTW Group and other immaterial
acquisitions. See Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of these acquisitions. See  Capital Resources  for a discussion of capital expenditures
during 2008 and 2007.

62 

Table of Contents   

Debt Financing Activities.  We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any
combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock. In August 2006, we issued $1
billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement, comprised of floating-rate
notes totaling $500 million and fixed-rate notes totaling $500 million. The $500 million in
floating-rate notes were repaid in August 2007. The fixed-rate notes bear interest at an annual
rate of 5.5%, payable semi-annually, and are due in August 2009. The net proceeds were used for
working capital and general corporate purposes, including the funding of several business
acquisitions during 2007.

A $1 billion revolving credit agreement is available to finance our operations and other cash flow
needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. Our revolving credit agreement
contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt
(long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus six times rentals and landing
fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed
0.7 to 1.0. Our leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 0.5 at May 31, 2008. We are in
compliance with this and all other restrictive covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do
not expect the covenants to affect our operations. As of May 31, 2008, no commercial paper was
outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future
borrowings.

Dividends.  Dividends paid were $124 million in 2008, $110 million in 2007 and $97 million in 2006.
On June 2, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock, an
increase of $0.01 per share. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2008 to stockholders of record as of
the close of business on June 13, 2008. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and
approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis
at the end of each fiscal year.

CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft,
vehicles, technology, facilities, and package handling and sort equipment. The amount and timing of
capital additions depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments,
anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced
services, geographical expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of
regulatory authorities.

The following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the
years ended May 31 (in millions):

63 

Table of Contents   

Capital expenditures during 2008 were slightly higher than the prior year primarily due to
increased spending for facility expansions. FedEx Express capital expenditures increased in 2008
primarily as a result of increased spending on air operations and sorting facilities, including the
construction of our new regional hub in Greensboro, North Carolina and the expansion of our primary
sorting facility in Memphis. FedEx Services capital expenditures increased in 2008 primarily due
to increased spending associated with information technology facility
expansions and the addition of
new FedEx Office locations. Capital spending at FedEx Ground increased in 2008 due to increased
spending on facilities and sort equipment associated with its comprehensive network expansion plan.
Other equipment capital expenditures increased at FedEx Express during 2008, primarily due to
expenditures for ground support equipment replacement, as well as sort equipment at our new Asia-Pacific hub in
Guangzhou, China. Capital expenditures increased during 2007 primarily due to increased spending
at FedEx Express for facility expansion and aircraft and related equipment and expenditures at
FedEx Office associated with its expansion program.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, our commercial
paper program, revolving bank credit facility and shelf registration statement with the SEC are
adequate to meet our current and foreseeable future working capital and capital expenditure needs.
In addition, other forms of secured financing may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine
that they best suit our needs for the foreseeable future. We have been successful in obtaining
investment capital, both domestic and international, although the marketplace for such capital can
become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources
available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital
acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs.

In February 2008, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( Act ) was signed into law. Among other
things, this Act provides a 50% bonus tax depreciation deduction for qualified property acquired or
constructed and placed in service in 2008. We anticipate that the Act will provide us with a
federal income tax deferral in 2009, reversing in later years. We estimate this deferral will
reduce our 2009 federal income tax payments by $50 million to $100 million; however, the actual
amount is subject to the nature and timing of our capital expenditures in 2009, which may be
impacted by ongoing weak economic conditions.

Our capital expenditures are expected to be less than $3 billion in 2009 and will include spending
for aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express, facility expansion at FedEx Ground and revenue
equipment at FedEx Freight. We also continue to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies.
Aircraft-related capital outlays include the Boeing 757s, the first of which enter revenue service
in 2009 and are 40% more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type they will replace, and the
new Boeing 777s, the first of which enter revenue service in 2010. These aircraft capital
expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to support
projected long-term international volume growth. However, we may temporarily ground certain
aircraft due to excess capacity in the current economic environment.

Due to the weak U.S. economy, during 2008 management took actions to reduce future capital
commitments by slowing the rate of expansion for new FedEx Office locations in 2009. We expect to
open approximately 60 new FedEx Office locations in 2009. This will allow FedEx Office management
to continue to focus on improving core services and the overall customer experience at existing
stores.

We are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and
will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible, while continuing to invest
strategically in growing service lines. We currently expect to fund our 2009 capital requirements
with cash from operations.

We have not repurchased any shares in recent years. However, we currently have the liquidity to
repurchase shares and may do so in the future. A total of 5.75 million shares remain under
existing share repurchase authorizations.

We have a senior unsecured debt credit rating from Standard   Poor s of BBB and a commercial paper
rating of A-2. Moody s Investors Service has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of
Baa2 and a commercial paper rating of P-2. Moody s and Standard   Poor s characterize our ratings
outlook as  stable.  If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. If our
commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial
paper market. If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to
financing may become limited. In 2009, scheduled debt payments include $502 million of principal payments on unsecured notes and
capitalized leases.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS  

The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2008.
Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are
disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Except for the current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, this table
does not include amounts already recorded in our balance sheet as current liabilities at May 31,
2008. Accordingly, this table is not meant to represent a forecast of our total cash expenditures
for any of the periods presented.

(1)  
       
     See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

(2)  
       
     Capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments. 

We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities are
not included in the table above. In addition, we have historically made voluntary tax-deductible
contributions to our principal U.S. domestic pension plans; however, such amounts have not been
legally required and therefore are not reflected in the table above.

We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income
taxes, qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and other
self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not
reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of
these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable within twelve
months that are included in current liabilities.

Table of Contents   

Operating Activities 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating
leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. Credit rating agencies routinely use information
concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity.
The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an
initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2008. In the past, we financed a
significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating
leases (a type of  off-balance sheet financing ). At the time that the decision to lease was made,
we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership
with respect to market values, liquidity or after-tax cash flows.

The
amounts reflected in the table above for purchase obligations represent noncancelable
agreements to purchase goods or services that are not capital related. Such contracts include
those for printing and advertising and promotions contracts. Open purchase orders that are
cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes
and are not included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding agreements.

Included in the preceding table within the caption entitled  Non-capital purchase obligations and
other  is our estimate of the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under
FIN 48. We cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which
the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the
liability ($80 million) is excluded from the preceding table. See Note 11 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for further information.

The amounts reflected in the table above for interest on long-term debt represent future interest
payments due on our long-term debt, all of which are fixed rate.

Investing Activities 

The amounts reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligations represent noncancelable
agreements to purchase capital-related equipment. Such contracts include those for certain
purchases of aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles, facilities, computers and other equipment
contracts. In addition, we have committed to modify our DC10 aircraft for two-man cockpit
configuration, which is reflected in the table above. Commitments to purchase aircraft in
passenger configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo
transport unless we have entered into a noncancelable commitment. Open purchase orders that are
cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes
and are not included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding agreements.

Financing Activities 

We have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments, not reflected in the
table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations,
including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required
under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international operations. The
underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets, where
applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the surety bonds and letters of
credit themselves.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop
amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative
policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the
application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates
that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However,
even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing
circumstances and new or better information.

The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most
judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are
material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of
these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our
independent registered public accounting firm.

RETIREMENT PLANS  

Overview.  We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These
programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and retiree healthcare
plans. The accounting for pension and healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as:
discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases;
employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These assumptions most significantly impact our
U.S. domestic pension plans.

A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

The determination of our annual retirement plans cost is highly sensitive to changes in the
assumptions discussed above because we have a large active workforce, a significant amount of
assets in the pension plans, and the payout of benefits will occur over an extended period in the
future. Total retirement plans cost decreased $82 million in
2008, and increased $33 million in 2007 and $83 million in
2006, primarily due to plan changes in
2008 and changes to these assumptions in 2007 and 2006.

In 2007, we announced changes to significantly redesign certain of our retirement programs.
Effective January 1, 2008, we increased the annual company matching contribution under the largest
of our 401(k) plans covering most employees from $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of eligible
compensation. Employees not participating in the 401(k) plan as of January 1, 2008 were
automatically enrolled at 3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible pay effective
March 1, 2008. The full cost of this benefit improvement will accelerate over the next few years.
Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a traditional pension benefit formula were capped for
most employees, and those benefits will be payable beginning at retirement. Beginning June 1,
2008, future pension benefits for most employees will be accrued under a cash balance formula we
call the Portable Pension Account. These changes will not affect the benefits of current retirees
and terminated vested participants. In addition, these pension plans were modified to accelerate
vesting from five years to three years effective June 1, 2008 for most participants.

67 

Table of Contents   

Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a
notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service,
and interest on the notional account balance. An employee s pay credits are determined each year
under a graded formula that combines age with years of service for points. The plan interest
credit rate will vary from year to year based on the selected U.S. Treasury index, with a minimum
rate of 4% or the one-year Treasury Constant Maturities rate plus 1% and a maximum rate based on
the average 30-year Treasury rate.

Retirement
plans cost in 2009 is expected to be approximately $567 million,
a decrease from 2008. We anticipate that the full-year impact of the enhanced 401(k) match described above
will be offset by a decline in pension
and retiree medical expense due to a significantly higher discount rate. We continue to expect the
long-term costs of our retirement plans to approximate those prior to the recent plan changes.
However, we expect that the costs of our retirement plans will become more predictable, as we
reduce highly volatile pension costs in favor of more predictable 401(k) costs associated with our
matching contributions. Retirement plans cost is included in the  Salaries and Employee Benefits 
caption in our consolidated income statements.

Pension Cost.  Of all of our retirement plans, our largest qualified U.S. domestic pension plan is
the most significant and subjective. The components of pension cost for all pension plans are as
follows (in millions):

Following is a discussion of the key estimates we consider in determining our pension costs:

Discount Rate . This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments
that have been accrued to date (the projected benefit obligation, or PBO) to their net present
value and to determine the succeeding year s pension expense. The discount rate is determined each
year at the plan measurement date. For 2008, our measurement date for determination of our PBO was
February 29, 2008, and our assumptions incorporated a discount rate of 6.96%. As described
previously in this MD A, due to our measurement date transition under SFAS 158, our measurement
date for 2009 expense was June 1, 2008, and our assumptions incorporated a discount rate of 7.15%.
An increase in the discount rate decreases pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive,
as the following table illustrates with our largest qualified U.S. domestic pension plan:

(1)  
       
     The discount rate in effect at the end of a given fiscal year
affects the current year s PBO and the succeeding year s
pension expense, except for 2009 which was affected by our
measurement date transition. The 2009 expense sensitivity is driven
by the 7.15% discount rate determined at the June 1, 2008
measurement date. 

(2)  
       
     Sensitivities show the impact on expense and the PBO of a
one-basis-point change in the discount rate. 

68 

Table of Contents   

We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit
obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of
actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated
Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years.
This bond modeling technique allows for the use of non-callable and make-whole bonds that meet
certain screening criteria to ensure that the selected bonds with a call feature have a low
probability of being called. To the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit
payments in a given period, the yield calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at
the one-year forward rates implied by the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. Pension costs for our
primary domestic pension plan were favorably affected in 2008 by approximately $27 million due to
the slight increase in the discount rate. The previous trend of declines in the discount rate
negatively affected our primary domestic pension plan expense by $89 million in 2007 and $101
million in 2006. Pension costs will be favorably affected in 2009 by approximately $225 million
due to the increase in the discount rate driven by higher interest
rates in the bond market year over year.

Plan Assets.  Pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities. Our pension plans
hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of
third-party pension fund investment managers. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets
is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is
required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. At February 29,
2008, with approximately $11.7 billion of plan assets in our domestic plans, a one-basis-point
change in this assumption for our domestic pension plans affects pension cost by approximately $1.2
million. We have assumed an 8.5% compound geometric long-term rate of return on our principal U.S.
domestic pension plan assets for 2009, unchanged from 2008 as discussed above.

Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental
matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can
employ with our pension plan assets; 

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected
compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the
next 10- to 15-year time period (or such other time period that may be appropriate); and 

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to
achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed
funds. 

69 

Table of Contents   

We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.
As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we are
also in the process of re-evaluating our pension investment strategy. We are currently evaluating
the mix of investments between equities and fixed income securities, the cash flows of which will
more closely align with the cash flows of our pension obligations.

To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by
third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These
studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation
of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected
future returns on those assets. The following table summarizes our current asset allocation
strategy:

The actual historical return on our U.S. pension plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric
basis, was 9.4%, net of investment manager fees, for the 15-year period ended February 29, 2008.

Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan
assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value method to determine the value of plan
assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and
decreases). Another method used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the
measurement date. The application of the calculated-value method equaled the result from applying
the market-value method for 2006 through 2008.

Salary Increases.  The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in
determining pension cost. Generally, we correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to
changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living
adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (since most incentive compensation is a
component of pensionable wages). Our average future salary increases based on age and years of
service were 4.47% for 2008, 3.46% for 2007 and 3.15% for 2006. Future salary increases are
estimated to be 4.49% for our 2009 pension costs. In the future, a one-basis-point
across-the-board change in the rate of estimated future salary increases will have an immaterial
impact on our pension costs.

Table of Contents   

Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of May 31 (in
millions):

The funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension
liabilities at the plan measurement date. Our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits
to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total
plan assets (benefit payments for 2008 were approximately 2.7% of plan assets). As described
previously in this MD A, the adoption of SFAS 158 in 2007 resulted in a $982 million charge to
shareholders  equity in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize the funded status of
the PBO. SFAS 158 also requires immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income even though such items continue to be deferred for the determination of
pension expense. The funded status of our plans improved substantially in 2008 due primarily to an
increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities and to voluntary funding of those
plans.

We made tax-deductible voluntary contributions of $479 million in 2008 and $482 million in 2007 to
our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. We currently expect to make tax-deductible voluntary
contributions to our qualified plans in 2009 at levels approximating those in 2008.

Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans expense determination were approximately
$2.5 billion through February 29, 2008, compared to $3.3 billion at February 28, 2007. These
unrecognized losses primarily reflect the declining discount rate from 2002 through 2006 and other
changes in assumptions. A portion is also attributable to the differences between expected and
actual asset returns, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may
be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless they are below a corridor
amount, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future
periods. For example, projected U.S. domestic plan pension expense for 2009 includes $44 million
of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $162 million in 2008, $136 million in 2007 and
$107 million in 2006.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS  

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers  compensation claims,
vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and
long-term disability programs. At May 31, 2008, there were approximately $1.4 billion of
self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet ($1.3 billion at May 31, 2007).
Approximately 41% of these accruals were classified as current liabilities in both 2008 and 2007.

The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience, judgments
about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We account for these
costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability
for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported, on a quarterly basis for
material accruals. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims
incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include consideration of factors such as,
severity of claim, frequency of claims, and costs associated with claims, such as projecting future
healthcare costs. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of
risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based
on risk tolerance and premium expense. Historically, it has been infrequent that incurred claims
exceeded our self-insured limits. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals
include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments based on historical development
factors.

We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and
effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation
technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the
length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these
expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare
costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels and other factors can materially
affect the estimates for these liabilities.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

Property and Equipment . Our key businesses are capital intensive, with approximately 53% of our
total assets invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize
only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards.
Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not
part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as incurred. However, consistent with
industry practice, we capitalize certain aircraft-related major maintenance costs on one of our
aircraft fleet types and amortize these costs over their estimated service lives.

The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the
determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events.
Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of
aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments
to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly
match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives
and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. These estimates affect
the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the
disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation
recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than
$15 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in
business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other
factors beyond our control.

72 

Table of Contents   

Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate
volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft
based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft
types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire
these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks
that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. In addition,
the soft U.S. economy will result in our temporarily grounding certain aircraft in 2009, although
we intend to continue to use these aircraft in our network. Aircraft purchases (primarily aircraft in
passenger configuration) that have not been placed in service totaled approximately $150 million at
May 31, 2008 and $71 million at May 31, 2007. We plan to modify these assets in the future to
place them into operation.

The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows
do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because
the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based
on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment
of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain
long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating
costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held
for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose
of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations for such aircraft
may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft.
Such estimates are subject to changes from period to period. There were no material property and
equipment impairment charges recognized in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Leases . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities and equipment.
Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end
of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in  Contractual Cash Obligations  and Note 7 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements, at May 31, 2008 we had approximately $16
billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The
weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2008 was
approximately seven years.

The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet
because these leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of
whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to
make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life.
In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease
arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the
construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner-lessor or, in substance, the owner of
the asset during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes
for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions
to assist us in making these evaluations.

Goodwill . We have approximately $3.2 billion of goodwill in our balance sheet from our
acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have
acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit
from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired entity.

FedEx Office Goodwill.  During 2008, we made several strategic decisions regarding FedEx Office.
During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Office was reorganized as a part of the FedEx Services
segment. FedEx Office provides retail access to our customers for our package transportation
businesses and an array of document and business services. FedEx Services provides access to
customers through digital channels such as fedex.com. Under FedEx Services, FedEx Office benefits
from the full range of resources and expertise of FedEx Services to continue to enhance the
customer experience, provide greater, more convenient access to the portfolio of services at FedEx,
and increase revenues through our retail network. This reorganization resulted in our ceasing to
treat FedEx Office as a core operating company; however, FedEx Office remains a reporting unit for
goodwill impairment testing purposes.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, several developments and strategic decisions occurred at FedEx
Office, including:

reorganizing senior management at FedEx Office with several positions terminated and
numerous reporting realignments, including naming a new president and CEO; 

determining that we would minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name over the next
several years; 

implementing revenue growth and cost management plans to improve financial performance;
and 

pursuing a more disciplined approach to the long-term expansion of the retail network,
reducing the overall level of expansion. 

We performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter for the Kinko s trade name and the
recorded goodwill for the FedEx Office reporting unit. In accordance with the accounting rules,
the trade name impairment test was performed before the goodwill impairment test.

In accordance with SFAS 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  a two-step impairment test is
performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compared the estimated fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying value. The valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of the FedEx
Office reporting unit was based primarily on an income approach that considered market participant
assumptions to estimate fair value. Key assumptions considered were the revenue and operating
income forecast, the assessed growth rate in the periods beyond the detailed forecast period, and
the discount rate.

In performing our impairment test, the most significant assumption used to estimate the fair value
of the FedEx Office reporting unit was the discount rate. We used a discount rate of 12.5%,
representing the estimated weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC ) of the FedEx Office reporting
unit. The development of the WACC used in our estimate of fair value considered the following key
factors:

benchmark capital structures for guideline companies with characteristics similar to the
FedEx Office reporting unit; 

current market conditions for the risk free interest rate; 

the size and industry of the FedEx Office reporting unit; and 

risks related to the forecast of future revenues and profitability of the FedEx Office
reporting unit. 

The WACC used in the estimate of fair value in future periods may be impacted by changes in market
conditions (including those of market participants), as well as the specific future performance of
the FedEx Office reporting unit and are subject to change, based on changes in specific facts and
circumstances.

In the second step of the impairment test, we estimated the current fair values of all assets and
liabilities to determine the amount of implied goodwill and consequently the amount of the goodwill
impairment. Upon completion of the second step of the impairment test, we concluded that the
recorded goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $367 million during the fourth
quarter of 2008. Significant judgments included in the second step of the impairment test included
fair value estimates of assets and liabilities, the aggregate effect of
which increased the impairment charge to goodwill by approximately $90 million. The goodwill
impairment charge is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income. This charge is included in the results of the FedEx Services segment and was not allocated
to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the core performance of these
businesses.

Other Reporting Units Goodwill.  Our annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of
estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income
approach incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue
growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used
by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Each year, independent
of our goodwill impairment test, we update our WACC calculation and
perform a long-range planning analysis to project expected results of operations. Using this data,
we complete a separate fair value analysis for each of our reporting units. Changes in forecasted
operations and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. We compare the fair
value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of those units. We
performed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2008. Because the fair value of
each of our other reporting units exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, no additional
testing or impairment charge was necessary.

Intangible Asset with an Indefinite Life . We have an intangible asset associated with the Kinko s
trade name. Prior to 2008, this intangible asset was not amortized because it had an indefinite
remaining useful life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, our intent was to continue to use the
Kinko s trade name indefinitely. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to change the
name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office and rebrand our retail locations over the next several years.
We believe the FedEx Office name better describes the wide range of services available at our
retail centers and takes full advantage of the FedEx brand. This change converted this asset to a
finite life asset and resulted in an impairment charge of $515 million. We estimated the fair
value of this intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method.
This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends,
royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. We
base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are
unpredictable and inherently uncertain.

The
$515 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining trade
name balance of $52 million, which we began amortizing in the fourth quarter on an accelerated basis over the next
four years. The trade name impairment charge is included in operating expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The charge is included in the results of the FedEx Services
segment and was not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the
core performance of these businesses.

CONTINGENCIES  

We are subject to various loss contingencies, including tax proceedings and litigation, in
connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their
measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further,
additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in
which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain.
Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the
nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a
liability, if any. Our material pending loss contingencies are described in Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any,
of individual matters or groups of matters not specifically described in Note 17 is not expected to
be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following
describes our method and associated processes for evaluating these matters.

75 

Table of Contents   

Tax Contingencies 

We are subject to income and operating tax rules of the U.S., and its states and municipalities,
and of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in
determining income tax provisions, as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, due to the
complexity of these rules and their interaction with one another. We account for income taxes
under SFAS 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  by recording both current taxes payable and deferred
tax assets and liabilities. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international
statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, applied to taxable income,
reduced by applicable tax credits.

We account for operating taxes based on multi-state and local taxing jurisdiction rules in those
areas in which we operate. Provisions for operating taxes are estimated based upon these rules,
asset acquisitions and disposals, historical spend and other variables. These provisions are
consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factors.

Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many
jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax contingencies are impacted by several factors,
including tax audits, appeals, litigation, changes in tax laws and other rules, and their
interpretations, and changes in our business, among other things, in the various federal, state,
local and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We regularly assess the potential impact
of these factors for the current and prior years to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions.
We continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust our tax
positions, including the current and deferred tax liabilities, in the period in which the facts
that give rise to a revision become known. In addition, management considers the advice of third
parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.

Effective June 1, 2007, we began to measure and record income tax contingency accruals in
accordance with FIN 48. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was immaterial.

Under FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step
process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The
second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more
than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective
to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We
reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes
available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to,
changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and
new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of
a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable,
penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and
accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented
as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are
recorded in the caption  Other liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets.

We
measure and record operating tax contingency accruals in accordance
with SFAS 5,  Accounting for Contingencies.  As discussed
below, SFAS 5 requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other
legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated.

76 

Table of Contents   

Other Contingencies 

Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to other legal proceedings
and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, employment-related claims and
FedEx Ground s owner-operators. We account for these contingencies in accordance with SFAS 5.
SFAS 5 requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other legal
proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur)
that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. SFAS 5
requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management s judgment, a material loss is
reasonably possible or probable of occurring.

Our legal department maintains thorough processes to identify, evaluate and monitor the status of
litigation and other loss contingencies as they arise and develop. Management has regular
litigation and contingency reviews, including updates from internal and external counsel, to assess
the need for accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies. In determining
whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors,
the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome or settlement and the ability to make a
reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the
outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously
estimated liability.

RISK FACTORS 

Our financial and operating results are subject to many risks and uncertainties, as described
below.

Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.   The FedEx brand
name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely
recognized, trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most
important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers and the
general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate
governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and
marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse
publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors or agents
could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss
of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources
to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.

We rely heavily on technology to operate our transportation and business networks, and any
disruption to our technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our operations and our
reputation among customers.   Our ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively
depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network, including our
ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers. Any disruption to the
Internet or our technology infrastructure, including those impacting our computer systems and Web site, could adversely impact
our customer service and our volumes and revenues and result in increased costs. While we have
invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans,
these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruptions and the resulting adverse
effect on our operations and financial results.

Our transportation businesses may be impacted by the price and availability of fuel.   We must
purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and
availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. To date, we have been mostly
successful in mitigating the expense impact of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel
surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we
are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or
some other reason, fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to
offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers,
especially in the U.S. domestic market, away from our higher-yielding express services to our
lower-yielding ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. These
effects were evident in the second half of 2008, as fuel prices reached all-time highs. In
addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate
our transportation networks.

77 

Table of Contents   

Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital expenditures based upon projected
volume levels.   We make significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, package handling
facilities, sort equipment, copy equipment and other capital to support our transportation and
business networks. We also make significant investments to rebrand, integrate and grow the
companies that we acquire. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors,
including our anticipated volume growth. For example, we must make commitments to purchase or
modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We must predict volume levels and
fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our
projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes.
Overcapacity could lead to asset dispositions or write-downs and undercapacity could negatively
impact service levels.

We face intense competition.   The transportation and business services markets are both highly
competitive and sensitive to price and service. Some of our competitors have more financial
resources than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables
them to raise capital more easily. We believe we compete effectively with these companies   for
example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, our competitors
determine the charges for their services. If the pricing environment becomes irrational, it could
limit our ability to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to
rising fuel costs) or to maintain or grow our market share. In addition, maintaining a broad
portfolio of services is important to keeping and attracting customers. While we believe we
compete effectively through our current service offerings, if our competitors offer a broader range
of services or more effectively bundle their services, it could impede our ability to maintain or
grow our market share.

If we do not effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses, our financial
results and reputation may suffer.   Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and
profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and to realize
the benefits we expect when we make those acquisitions. In furtherance of this strategy, during
2007 we acquired the LTL freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines (renamed FedEx National LTL) and
made strategic acquisitions in China, the United Kingdom and India. During 2004, we acquired
Kinko s, Inc. (now known as FedEx Office). While we expect these acquisitions to enhance our value
proposition to customers and improve our long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we
will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can
continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets. During the fourth
quarter of 2008, we recorded a charge of approximately $891 million, predominantly for impairment
of the value of the Kinko s trade name and a portion of the goodwill recorded as a result of the
Kinko s acquisition. The charge was necessary, among other reasons, because we revised our
long-term growth plans for that company and its financial performance did not meet our original
expectations.

Table of Contents   

FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its operations, and the status of these
owner-operators as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.   FedEx
Ground s use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business
and its customers, as evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment. We are involved in
numerous class-action lawsuits (including many that have been certified as class actions), several
individual lawsuits and numerous tax and other administrative proceedings (including a tentative
assessment in an IRS audit) that claim that the company s owner-operators or their drivers should
be treated as our employees, rather than independent contractors. We expect to incur certain
costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as
independent contractors. We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as
independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s
independent contractors. However, adverse determinations in these matters could, among other
things, entitle certain of our contractors and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain
expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and
benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor
status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators. If FedEx Ground is compelled to convert its independent
contractors to employees, our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur
significant capital outlays.

Increased security requirements could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express.  
As a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, governments around the world
are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase
operating costs for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. For example, in
May 2006, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) adopted new rules enhancing many
of the security requirements for air cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, and in May
2007, the TSA issued a revised model all-cargo aircraft security program for implementing the new
rules. Together with other all-cargo aircraft operators, we filed comments with the TSA requesting
clarification regarding several provisions in the revised model program. Until the requirements
for our security program under the new rules are finalized, we cannot determine the effect that
these new rules will have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably
possible, however, that these rules or other future security requirements for air cargo carriers
could impose material costs on us.

The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may impact our air operations.   Our extensive
air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the
approval of the Department of Transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement between
the United States and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign
governments to provide specific flights and services. Regulatory actions affecting global aviation
rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets could
impair our ability to operate our air network.

We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such
change.   Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to
significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. For example, in the past several years, the U.S. Congress has considered various bills
that would regulate GHG emissions. While these bills have not yet received sufficient
Congressional support, some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the
relatively near future. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft or
diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other
energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or trucks
prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot
predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible,
however, that it could impose material costs on us. Moreover, even without such regulation,
increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by
companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce
customer demand for our services, especially our air express services.

79 

Table of Contents   

We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:  

the impact of any international conflicts or terrorist activities on the United States and
global economies in general, the transportation industry or us in particular, and what effects
these events will have on our costs or the demand for our services; 

any impacts on our businesses resulting from new domestic or international government laws
and regulation, including tax, accounting, trade, labor, environmental or postal rules; 

our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses,
and match it to shifting and future customer volume levels; 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, Canadian
dollar, British pound and Japanese yen, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency
sales prices; 

our ability to maintain good relationships with our employees and prevent attempts by labor
organizations to organize groups of our employees, which could significantly increase our
operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility; 

a shortage of qualified labor and our ability to mitigate this shortage through recruiting
and retention efforts and productivity gains; 

increasing costs, the volatility of costs and legal mandates for employee benefits,
especially pension and healthcare benefits; 

significant changes in the volumes of shipments transported through our networks, customer
demand for our various services or the prices we obtain for our services; 

market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives; 

any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action litigation,
such as wage-and-hour and discrimination and retaliation claims, patent litigation, and any
other legal proceedings; 

the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services; 

adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which
can damage our property, disrupt our operations, increase fuel costs and adversely affect
shipment levels; 

widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public
health crisis; and 

availability of financing on terms acceptable to us and our ability to maintain our current
credit ratings, especially given the capital intensity of our operations, and the current
volatility of credit markets. 

80 

Table of Contents   

We are directly affected by the state of the economy.   While the global, or macro-economic, risks
listed above apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry
is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business
is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of
goods   key macroeconomic measurements. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer
goods, we transport fewer goods. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure,
which is difficult to adjust to match shifting volume levels. Moreover, as we grow our
international business, we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things,
defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated
information systems for processing transactions and a properly staffed, professional internal audit
department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified. Our procedures for
financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and
our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.

Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2008, the end of our fiscal year.
Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of May 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2008, has been
audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited
the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst
  Young LLP s report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting is included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
FedEx Corporation

We have audited FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2008,
based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). FedEx Corporation s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, FedEx Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of May 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders  investment and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2008
of FedEx Corporation and our report dated July 10, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of FedEx Corporation at May 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended May 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective June 1, 2006, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123 (revised 2004),
 Share-Based Payment,  and effective May 31, 2007 the Company adopted SFAS No. 158,  Employer s
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation,
e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently
and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies
include Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the world s largest express transportation
company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading provider of small-package
ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation, a leading U.S. provider of
less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. Our FedEx Services segment provides customer-facing
sales, marketing and information technology support, as well as retail access for customers through
FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ), formerly FedEx Kinko s, primarily for the
benefit of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. These companies represent our major service lines and
form the core of our reportable segments.

FISCAL YEARS . Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended
May 31, 2008 or ended May 31 of the year referenced.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx
and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to
conform to the current year presentation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION . We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments for our transportation
businesses and upon completion of services for our business services, logistics and trade services
businesses. Certain of our transportation services are provided with the use of independent
contractors. FedEx is the principal to the transaction in most instances and in those cases
revenue from these transactions is recognized on a gross basis. Costs associated with independent
contractor settlements are recognized as incurred and included in the caption  Purchased
transportation  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For shipments in transit,
revenue is recorded based on the percentage of service completed at the balance sheet date.
Estimates for future billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable are recognized at the
time of shipment for money-back service guarantees and billing corrections. Delivery costs are
accrued as incurred.

Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain transportation businesses engage in some
transactions wherein they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded on a net
basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, including
transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions, and taxes and duties. These amounts are not
material.

Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes assessed by governmental
authorities, such as sales tax. We present these revenues net of tax.

CREDIT RISK . We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business
services without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially
mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of
customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most of our services. Allowances for
potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and current evaluation of the
composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit losses have been within management s
expectations.

ADVERTISING . Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other
operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were $445 million in 2008, $406 million in
2007 and $376 million in 2006.

CASH EQUIVALENTS . Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term,
interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is
stated at cost, which approximates market value.

SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL . Spare parts (principally aircraft related) are reported at
weighted-average cost. Supplies and fuel are reported at standard cost, which approximates actual
cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts
expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are
provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. Additionally,
allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or
obsolete. These allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Expenditures for major additions, improvements, flight equipment
modifications and certain equipment overhaul costs are capitalized when such costs are determined
to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft-related major
maintenance costs on one of our aircraft fleet types, which are capitalized as incurred and
amortized over their estimated service lives. We capitalize certain direct internal and external
costs associated with the development of internal use software. Gains and losses on sales of
property used in operations are classified within operating expenses.

For financial reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment
on a straight-line basis over the asset s service life or related lease term. For income tax
purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when applicable. The depreciable
lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions):

Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of
aircraft costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 18 years. We periodically
evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and
equipment. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values. Such
changes did not materially affect depreciation expense in any period presented. Depreciation
expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $1.8
billion in 2008, $1.7 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion in 2006. Depreciation and amortization
expense includes amortization of assets under capital lease.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST . Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of
aircraft, construction of certain facilities and development of certain software up to the date the
asset is ready for its intended use is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the
asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $50 million in 2008, $34 million in
2007 and $33 million in 2006.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances
indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and
used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is
made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between
the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values,
discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of
are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. We operate
integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets
are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment.

GOODWILL.  Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise
to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and
the existing workforce of the acquired entity. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including
attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income approach
incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue growth
rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Unless circumstances
otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  Intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, technology
assets and contract-based intangibles acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are
amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or an
accelerated basis depending upon the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized.
Non-amortizing intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment by comparing the carrying
amount to fair value. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment
testing in the fourth quarter.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . On May 31, 2007, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans.  SFAS 158 requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in accumulated
other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or
credits. The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a $982 million charge to shareholders  equity at May
31, 2007 through AOCI.

Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide
with the sponsor s year end. We currently use a February 28 (February 29 in 2008) measurement date
for our plans; therefore, this standard will require us to change our measurement date to May 31
(beginning in 2009). We are required to make our transition election in the first quarter of 2009
and plan to elect the two-measurement approach as our transition method. Under the two-measurement
approach, we complete two actuarial measurements, one at February 29, 2008 and the other at June 1,
2008. For the transition period from February 29, 2008 through June 1, 2008, we will record the
net periodic benefit cost, net of tax, as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and the
actuarial gains and losses, net of tax, as an adjustment to AOCI in the first quarter of 2009. The
impact of adopting the measurement date provision on our financial statements is not expected to be
material to our financial position or results of operations, but will reduce our 2009 pension and
retiree medical expense by approximately $87 million under the two-measurement approach due to an
increase in the discount rate and higher plan assets.

Table of Contents   

In 2007, we announced changes to significantly redesign certain of our retirement programs.
Effective May 31, 2008, all benefits previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a
traditional pension benefit formula were capped for most employees, and those benefits will be
payable beginning at retirement. Beginning June 1, 2008, future pension benefits for most
employees will be accrued under a
cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account (as described in Note 12). These changes
will not affect the benefits of current retirees and terminated vested participants.

Currently, our defined benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect
management s assumptions for discount rate, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets,
salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover and future increases in
healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the
projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the
assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate
bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments. A
calculated-value method is employed for purposes of determining the expected return on the plan
asset component of net periodic pension cost for our qualified U.S. pension plans. We do not fund
defined benefit plans when such funding provides no current tax deduction or when such funding
would be deemed current compensation to plan participants.

INCOME TAXES . Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred
taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.

On June 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No.
( FIN ) 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.  This interpretation establishes new
standards for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative effect of adopting
FIN 48 was immaterial. See Note 11 for more information concerning our adoption of FIN 48.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available
evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires
us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such
amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to
management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in
facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, and new audit
activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable,
penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and
accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented
as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated
within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in
the caption  Other liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets.

SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS . We are primarily self-insured for workers  compensation claims, vehicle
accidents and general liabilities, benefits paid under employee healthcare programs and long-term
disability benefits. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost
of claims, which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers  compensation claims,
vehicle and general liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability are included in
accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of
risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based
on risk tolerance and premium expense.

LEASES . We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under capital and operating
leases. The commencement date of all leases is the earlier of the date we become legally obligated
to make rent payments or the date we may exercise control over the use of the property. In
addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases provide for contingent rentals based on
equipment usage principally related to aircraft leases at FedEx Express and copier usage at FedEx
Office. Rent expense associated with contingent rentals is recorded as incurred. Certain of our
leases contain fluctuating or escalating payments and rent holiday periods. The related rent
expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The cumulative excess of rent
payments over rent expense is accounted for as a deferred lease asset and recorded in  Intangible
and other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative excess of rent
expense over rent payments is accounted for as a deferred lease obligation. Leasehold improvements
associated with assets utilized under capital or operating leases are amortized over the shorter of
the asset s useful life or the lease term.

DEFERRED GAINS . Gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are
deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense.
Substantially all of these deferred gains are related to aircraft transactions.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION . Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local
currencies as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred
income taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common stockholders 
investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on
transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in the caption
 Other, net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income and were immaterial for each period presented. Cumulative net foreign
currency translation gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss were $167 million at May 31,
2008, $69 million at May 31, 2007 and $43 million at May 31, 2006.

EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots of FedEx Express, who represent a
small percentage of our total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining agreement.
During the second quarter of 2007, the pilots ratified a new four-year labor contract that included
signing bonuses and other upfront compensation of approximately $143 million, as well as pay
increases and other benefit enhancements. These costs were partially mitigated by reductions in
the variable incentive compensation of our other employees. The effect of this new agreement on
second quarter 2007 net income was approximately $78 million net of tax, or $0.25 per diluted
share.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION . In 2007, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R,  Share-Based Payment, 
which requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value
method. SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  and
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. ( APB ) 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we applied APB 25 and its related interpretations
to measure compensation expense for stock-based compensation plans. As a result, no compensation
expense was recorded for stock options, as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our
common stock at the date of grant.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, which resulted in prospective
recognition of compensation expense for all outstanding unvested share-based payments based on the
fair value on the original grant date. Under this method of adoption, our financial statement
amounts for the prior period presented have not been restated.

The impact of adopting SFAS 123R for the year ended May 31, 2007 was approximately $71 million ($52
million, net of tax), or $0.17 per basic and diluted share.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE . On June 2, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a dividend
of $0.11 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2008 to stockholders of
record as of the close of business on June 13, 2008. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to
review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an
annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.

USE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes
its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other
information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are
recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the
period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the
estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts
estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive
accruals; tax liabilities; obsolescence of spare parts; contingent liabilities; loss contingencies,
such as litigation and other claims; and impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including
goodwill).

NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and
the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting
pronouncements, in addition to FIN 48 and SFAS 158, are relevant to the readers of our financial statements.

95 

Table of Contents   

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,  Fair Value Measurements,  which provides a common
definition of fair value, establishes a uniform framework for measuring fair value and requires
expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The requirements of SFAS 157 are to be applied
prospectively, and we anticipate that the primary impact of the standard to us will be related to
the measurement of fair value in our recurring impairment test calculations (such as measurements
of our recorded goodwill). SFAS 157 is effective for us beginning on June 1, 2008; however, the
FASB approved a one-year deferral of the adoption of the standard as it relates to non-financial
assets and
liabilities with the issuance in February 2008 of FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2,  Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 157.  We do not presently hold any financial assets or liabilities that would
require recognition under SFAS 157 other than investments held by our pension plans. In addition,
the FASB has excluded leases from the scope of SFAS 157. We anticipate that this standard will not
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R,  Business Combinations,  and SFAS 160,  Accounting and
Reporting Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.
51.  These new standards significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business
combination transactions and noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority
interests) in consolidated financial statements. The key aspects of SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 include
requiring the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishing the acquisition-date fair value
as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requiring the
expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs. Both standards are effective for us
beginning June 1, 2009 (fiscal 2010) and are applicable only to transactions occurring after the
effective date.

NOTE 3: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During 2007, we made the following acquisitions:

The acquisition of the assets and assumption of certain obligations of FedEx National LTL, a
leading provider of long-haul LTL services, extended our service
offerings to the long-haul LTL freight sector. The acquisition of all of the outstanding capital
stock of FedEx U.K. has allowed us to establish a domestic service in
the United Kingdom and better serve the U.K. international market, which we previously served primarily through
independent agents. The FedEx Express acquisition of DTW Group s 50% share of the FedEx-DTW
International Priority express joint venture and assets relating to DTW Group s domestic express
network in China converted our joint venture with DTW Group into a
wholly owned subsidiary and has increased our presence in China in the international market and
established our presence in the domestic market. During 2007, we
also made other immaterial acquisitions that are not presented in the table above.

These acquisitions were not material to our results of operations or financial condition. The
portion of the purchase price allocated to goodwill and other identified intangible assets for the
FedEx National LTL, FedEx U.K. and DTW Group acquisitions will be deductible for U.S. tax purposes
over 15 years.

96 

Table of Contents   

Pro forma results of these acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, would not differ
materially from reported results in any of the periods presented. The purchase prices were
allocated as follows (in millions):

The intangible assets acquired in the FedEx National LTL and FedEx U.K. acquisitions consist
primarily of customer-related intangible assets, which will be amortized on an accelerated basis
over their average estimated useful lives of seven years for FedEx National LTL and up to 12 years
for FedEx U.K., with the majority of the amortization recognized during the first four years. The
intangible assets acquired in the DTW Group acquisition relate to the reacquired rights for the use
of certain FedEx technology and service marks. These intangible assets will be amortized over
their estimated useful lives of approximately two years.

We paid the purchase price for these acquisitions from available cash balances, which included the
net proceeds from our $1 billion senior unsecured debt offering completed during 2007. See Note 6
for further discussion of this debt offering.

NOTE 4: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES

The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment and changes
therein follows (in millions):

(1)  
       
     Primarily FedEx U.K. and DTW Group acquisitions. 

(2)  
       
     FedEx National LTL acquisition. 

(3)  
       
     Primarily currency translation adjustments. 

During 2008, we made several strategic decisions regarding FedEx Office. During the first quarter
of 2008, FedEx Office was reorganized as a part of the FedEx Services segment. FedEx Office
provides retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses and an array of
document and business services. FedEx Services provides access to customers through digital
channels such as fedex.com. Under FedEx Services, FedEx Office benefits from the full range of
resources and expertise of FedEx Services to continue to enhance the customer experience, provide
greater, more convenient access to the portfolio of services at FedEx, and increase revenues
through our retail network. This reorganization resulted in our ceasing to treat FedEx Office as a
core operating company; however, FedEx Office remains a reporting unit for goodwill impairment
testing purposes.

97 

Table of Contents   

During the fourth quarter of 2008, several developments and strategic decisions occurred at FedEx
Office, including:

reorganizing senior management at FedEx Office with several positions terminated and
numerous reporting realignments, including naming a new president and CEO; 

determining that we would minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name over the next
several years; 

implementing revenue growth and cost management plans to improve financial performance;
and 

pursuing a more disciplined approach to the long-term expansion of the retail network,
reducing the overall level of expansion. 

We performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter for the Kinko s trade name and the
recorded goodwill for the FedEx Office reporting unit. In accordance with the accounting rules,
the trade name impairment test was performed before the goodwill impairment test.

In accordance with SFAS 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  a two-step impairment test is
performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compared the estimated fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying value. The valuation methodology to estimate the fair value of the FedEx
Office reporting unit was based primarily on an income approach that considered market participant
assumptions to estimate fair value. Key assumptions considered were the revenue and operating
income forecast, the assessed growth rate in the periods beyond the detailed forecast period, and
the discount rate.

In performing our impairment test, the most significant assumption used to estimate the fair value
of the FedEx Office reporting unit was the discount rate. We used a discount rate of 12.5%,
representing the estimated weighted-average cost of capital ( WACC ) of the FedEx Office reporting
unit. The development of the WACC used in our estimate of fair value considered the following key
factors:

benchmark capital structures for guideline companies with characteristics similar to the
FedEx Office reporting unit; 

current market conditions for the risk free interest rate; 

the size and industry of the FedEx Office reporting unit; and 

risks related to the forecast of future revenues and profitability of the FedEx Office
reporting unit. 

The WACC used in the estimate of fair value in future periods may be impacted by changes in market
conditions (including those of market participants), as well as the specific future performance of
the FedEx Office reporting unit and are subject to change, based on changes in specific facts and
circumstances.

In the second step of the impairment test, we estimated the current fair values of all assets and
liabilities to determine the amount of implied goodwill and consequently the amount of the goodwill
impairment. Upon completion of the second step of the impairment test, we concluded that the
recorded goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $367 million during the fourth
quarter of 2008. Significant judgments included in the second step of the impairment test included
fair value estimates of assets and liabilities, the aggregate effect of
which increased the impairment charge to goodwill by approximately $90 million. The goodwill
impairment charge is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income. This charge is included in the results of the FedEx Services segment and was not allocated
to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the core performance of these
businesses.

98 

Table of Contents   

The components of our intangible assets were as follows (in millions):

We have an intangible asset associated with the Kinko s trade name. Prior to 2008, this intangible
asset was not amortized because it had an indefinite remaining useful life. Prior to the fourth
quarter of 2008, our intent was to continue to use the Kinko s trade name indefinitely. During the
fourth quarter, we made the decision to change the name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office and
rebrand our retail locations over the next several years. We believe the FedEx Office name better
describes the wide range of services available at our retail centers and takes full advantage of
the FedEx brand. This change converted this asset to a finite life asset and resulted in an
impairment charge of $515 million. We estimated the fair value of this intangible asset based on
an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent on a number of
factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of
intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on
assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.

The
$515 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining trade
name balance of $52 million, which we began amortizing in the fourth quarter on an accelerated basis over the next
four years. The trade name impairment charge is included in operating expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The charge is included in the results of the FedEx Services
segment and was not allocated to our transportation segments, as the charge was unrelated to the
core performance of these businesses.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $60 million in 2008, $42 million in 2007 and $25
million in 2006. Estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows (in
millions):

Table of Contents   

Scheduled annual principal maturities of debt, exclusive of capital leases, for the five years
subsequent to May 31, 2008, are as follows (in millions):

Interest on our fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. We have a shelf registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that allows us to sell, in one or more
future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock. In August
2006, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement,
comprised of floating-rate notes totaling $500 million and fixed-rate notes totaling $500 million.
The $500 million in floating-rate notes were repaid in August 2007. The fixed-rate notes bear
interest at an annual rate of 5.5%, payable semi-annually, and are due in August 2009. The net
proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the funding of
several business acquisitions during 2007.

From time to time, we finance certain operating and investing activities, including acquisitions,
through borrowings under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or the issuance of commercial
paper. The revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions, none of which
are expected to significantly affect our operations or ability to pay dividends. Our commercial
paper program is backed by unused commitments under the revolving credit facility and borrowings
under the program reduce the amount available under the credit facility. At May 31, 2008, no
commercial paper borrowings were outstanding and the entire amount under the credit facility was
available.

Long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had carrying values of $1.8 billion compared with an
estimated fair value of approximately $1.9 billion at May 31, 2008, and $2.3 billion compared with
an estimated fair value of $2.4 billion at May 31, 2007. The estimated fair values were determined
based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and
maturities.

We issue other financial instruments in the normal course of business to support our operations.
Letters of credit at May 31, 2008 were $735 million. The amount unused under our letter of credit
facility totaled approximately $29 million at May 31, 2008. This facility expires in July 2010.
These instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are used in the
normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments
are reflected in the balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is
reflected for the letters of credit.

Our capital lease obligations include leases for aircraft and facilities. Our facility leases
include leases that guarantee the repayment of certain special facility revenue bonds that have
been issued by municipalities primarily to finance the acquisition and construction of various
airport facilities and equipment. These bonds require interest payments at least annually, with
principal payments due at the end of the related lease agreement.

NOTE 7: LEASES

We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities, retail locations and equipment under capital and
operating leases that expire at various dates through 2040. We leased approximately 14% of our
total aircraft fleet under capital or operating leases as of May 31, 2008. In addition,
supplemental aircraft are leased by us under agreements that provide for cancellation upon 30 days 
notice. Our leased facilities include national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities,
retail facilities and administrative buildings.

The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2008 was
approximately seven years. While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the
use of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease
agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.

FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay
principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not
direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.

Our results for 2006 included a noncash charge of $79 million ($49 million net of tax or $0.16 per
diluted share) to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases, predominantly at FedEx
Express. This charge, which included the impact on prior years, related primarily to rent
escalations in on-airport facility leases that were not being recognized appropriately.

NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up
to 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The stock is issuable in series, which may vary as to
certain rights and preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2008, none of these shares had
been issued.

NOTE 9: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock.

STOCK OPTIONS . Under the provisions of our incentive stock plans, key employees and non-employee
directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than
its fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years.
Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to four years, with approximately 84% of options
granted vesting ratably over four years.

RESTRICTED STOCK.  Under the terms of our incentive stock plans, restricted shares of our common
stock are awarded to key employees. All restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year
period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. Compensation related to these
awards is recognized as expense over the explicit service period.

For unvested stock options granted prior to June 1, 2006 and all restricted stock awards, the terms
of these awards provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee s retirement.
Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the remaining service or vesting period. This postretirement vesting provision was
removed from all stock option awards granted subsequent to May 31, 2006.

VALUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS . We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair
value of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based on the stock price of the
award on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the requisite
service period of the award in the  Salaries and employee benefits  caption in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

103 

Table of Contents   

The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option,
stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Many of these assumptions are
judgmental and highly sensitive. Following is a table of the weighted-average Black-Scholes value
of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions), and the key
weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for the options granted during the
years ended May 31, and then a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions
used in the valuation model:

Expected Lives.  This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain
outstanding. Generally, options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. We examine actual stock
option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. An increase in the expected term
will increase compensation expense.

Expected Volatility.  Actual changes in the market value of our stock are used to calculate the
volatility assumption. We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past
period equal to the expected life of the options to determine volatility. An increase in the
expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Risk-Free Interest Rate.  This is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a
term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will
increase compensation expense.

Dividend Yield.  This is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the
option. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

The following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the year ended May 31,
2008:

The options granted during the year ended May 31, 2008 are primarily related to our principal
annual stock option grant in July 2007.

104 

Table of Contents   

The following table summarizes information about vested and unvested restricted stock for the year
ended May 31, 2008:

During the year ended May 31, 2007, there were 175,005 shares of restricted stock granted with a
weighted-average fair value of $109.90. During the year ended May 31, 2006, there were 233,939
shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted-average fair value of $90.12.

The following table summarizes information about stock option vesting during the years ended May
31:

As of May 31, 2008, there was $136 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of
estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. This
compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
weighted-average vesting period of approximately two years.

Total shares outstanding or available for grant related to equity compensation at May 31, 2008
represented 6.5% of the total outstanding common and equity compensation shares and equity
compensation shares available for grant.

NOTE 10: COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended May 31 was as
follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

NOTE 11: INCOME TAXES

The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended May 31 were as follows (in
millions):

106 

Table of Contents   

Pretax earnings of foreign operations for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $803 million, $648
million and $606 million, respectively, which represents only a portion of total results associated
with international shipments.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the
years ended May 31 was as follows:

Our 2008 tax rate increased primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment charge described in
Note 4, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Our 2007 tax rate of 37.3% was favorably
impacted by the conclusion of various state and federal tax audits and appeals. The 2007 rate
reduction was partially offset by tax charges incurred as a result of a reorganization in Asia
associated with our acquisition in China, as described in Note 3.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 31 were as follows (in
millions):

The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows
(in millions):

107 

Table of Contents   

We have $404 million of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions and $255
million of state operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowance primarily represents amounts
reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which expire over varying periods
starting in 2009. As a result of this and other factors, we believe that a substantial portion of
these deferred tax assets may not be realized.

Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $147 million in 2008 and $43 million in
2007. We have not recognized deferred taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the unremitted
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Upon
distribution, in the form of dividends or otherwise, these unremitted earnings would be subject to
U.S. federal income tax. Unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion,
if not all, of the U.S. tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S.
income tax liability is not practicable.

On June 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was immaterial to our
retained earnings.  Our liability for income taxes under FIN 48 was $72 million at June 1, 2007,
and $88 million at May 31, 2008. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $26 million on
June 1, 2007, and $25 million on May 31, 2008. Total interest and penalties included in our
statement of operations is immaterial. The liability recorded includes $57 million at June 1,
2007, and $68 million at May 31, 2008, associated with positions that if favorably resolved would
provide a benefit to our effective tax rate.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
Service is currently examining our returns for the 2004 through 2006 tax years. We are no longer
subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for years through 2003 except for specific U.S.
federal income tax positions that are in various stages of appeal. No resolution date can be
reasonably estimated at this time for these audits and appeals. We are also subject to ongoing
audits in state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions throughout the world.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in
millions):

Included in the May 31, 2008 balance are $8 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
deductibility or income inclusion is certain but for which there may be uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility or income inclusion. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome
or the timing of resolution for tax positions under FIN 48. Changes may result from the conclusion
of ongoing audits or appeals in state, local, federal and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the
resolution of various proceedings between the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our liability for
tax positions under FIN 48 includes no matters that are individually material to us. It is
reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax
positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months, but an estimate of the range of the
reasonably possible changes cannot be made. However, we do not expect that the resolution of any of
our tax positions under FIN 48 will be material.

NOTE 12: RETIREMENT PLANS

We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs
include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and retiree healthcare plans.
The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount
rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee
turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These assumptions most significantly impact our U.S.
domestic pension plans.

In 2007, we announced changes to significantly redesign certain of our retirement programs.
Effective January 1, 2008, we increased the annual company matching contribution under the largest
of our 401(k) plans covering most employees from $500 to a maximum of 3.5% of eligible
compensation. Employees not participating in the 401(k) plan as of January 1, 2008 were
automatically enrolled at 3% of eligible pay with a company match of 2% of eligible pay effective
March 1, 2008. The full cost of this benefit improvement will accelerate over the next few years.
Effective May 31, 2008, benefits previously accrued under our primary pension plans using a
traditional pension benefit formula were capped for most employees, and those benefits will be
payable beginning at retirement. Beginning June 1, 2008, future pension benefits for most
employees will be accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account. These
changes will not affect the benefits of current retirees and terminated vested participants. In
addition, these pension plans were modified to accelerate vesting from five years to three years
effective June 1, 2008 for most participants.

A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):

PENSION
PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at
least one year of service. Eligible employees as of May 31, 2003 were given the opportunity to
make a one-time election to accrue future pension benefits under either the Portable Pension
Account or a traditional pension benefit formula. Benefits provided under the traditional formula
are based on average earnings and years of service. Under the Portable Pension Account, the
retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual
credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account
balance. Eligible employees hired after May 31, 2003 accrue benefits exclusively under the
Portable Pension Account. We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering
certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international
employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on
final earnings and years of service and are funded in accordance with local practice. Where plans
are funded, they are funded in compliance with local laws.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision
coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. U.S. employees covered by the
principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent,
continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to  January 1,
1988,  or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.
Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer
cost, which has been reached and, therefore, these benefits are not subject to additional future
inflation.

109 

Table of Contents   

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT . As discussed in Note 1, we adopted the recognition and disclosure
provisions of SFAS 158 on May 31, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 158 required recognition in the
balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans, and the recognition in AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits. The funded
status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected
benefit obligation ( PBO ) of the plan. The adoption of SFAS 158
resulted in a $982 million charge to shareholders  equity at May 31, 2007 through AOCI. At May 31, 2008, under the provisions of SFAS 158, we
recorded an increase to equity of $469 million (net of tax) based on a $1 billion improvement in the funded
status of our retirement plans since May 31, 2007.

Additionally, SFAS 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide
with the sponsor s year end. We currently use a February 28 (February 29 in 2008) measurement date
for our plans; therefore, this standard will require us to change our measurement date to May 31
(beginning in 2009). We are required to make our transition election in the first quarter of 2009
and plan to elect the two-measurement approach as our transition method. Under the two-measurement
approach, we complete two actuarial measurements, one at February 29, 2008 and the other at June 1,
2008. For the transition period from February 29, 2008 through June 1, 2008, we will record the
net periodic benefit cost, net of tax, as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and the
actuarial gains and losses, net of tax, as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income
in the first quarter of 2009. The impact of adopting the measurement date provision on our
financial statements is not expected to be material to our financial position or results of
operations, but will reduce our 2009 pension and retiree
medical expense by approximately $87 million under the two-measurement approach due to an increase
in the discount rate and higher plan assets.

PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS.  Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to
measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

We currently use a measurement date of February 28 (February 29 in 2008) for our pension and
postretirement healthcare plans. Management reviews the assumptions used to measure pension costs
on an annual basis. Economic and market conditions at the measurement date impact these
assumptions from year to year and it is reasonably possible that material changes in pension cost
may be experienced in the future. Additional information about our pension plans can be found in
the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis.

Actuarial gains or losses are generated for changes in assumptions and to the extent that actual
results differ from those assumed. These actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the
remaining average service lives of our active employees if they exceed a corridor amount in the
aggregate.

Predominantly
all of our plan assets are actively managed. The investment strategy for pension plan
assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, together
with public and private fixed income portfolios, to earn a long-term investment return that meets
our pension plan obligations. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an
effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices.

110 

Table of Contents   

The weighted-average asset allocations for our domestic pension plans at the measurement date were
as follows:

Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental
matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can
employ with our pension plan assets; 

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected
compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the
next 10- to 15-year time period (or such other time period that may be appropriate); and 

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to
achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed
funds. 

We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.
As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we are
also in the process of re-evaluating our pension investment strategy. We are currently evaluating
the mix of investments between equities and fixed income securities, the cash flows of which will
more closely align with the cash flows of our pension obligations.

To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by
third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These
studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation
of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate
probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The studies performed or updated
supported the reasonableness of our expected rate of return of 8.5% for 2008 and 9.1% for 2007 and
2006. Our estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets remains at 8.5% for 2009. Our actual
returns exceeded this assumption for the 15-year period ended February 29, 2008.

At May 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a PBO or ABO in
excess of plan assets were as follows (in millions):

The APBO exceeds plan assets for all of our postretirement healthcare plans.

Plan funding is actuarially determined and is subject to certain tax law limitations.
International defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on final earnings or
final average earnings and years of service and are funded in accordance with local practice.
Where plans are funded, they are funded in compliance with local laws and income tax regulations.
Amounts contributed to these plans are not recoverable by us. We made tax-deductible voluntary
contributions of $479 million in 2008 and $482
million in 2007 to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. We currently expect to make
tax-deductible voluntary contributions to our qualified plans in 2009 at levels approximating those
in 2008.

113 

Table of Contents   

At the end of 2007 and prior to our adoption of SFAS 158, we recorded a minimum pension liability
on a plan-by-plan basis for many of our pension plans for the amount by which the ABO exceeded the
fair value of the plan assets, after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension
cost for the plan. We subsequently eliminated the minimum pension liability balance and intangible
assets related to our plans that had been recorded prior to adoption. The minimum liability
eliminated at May 31, 2007 was $191 million.

Net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended May 31 were as follows (in millions):

Decreases in pension costs from 2007 to 2008 are primarily the result of the plan changes discussed
above and in Note 1. Increases in pension costs from 2006 to 2007 are primarily the result of
changes in discount rate.

Amounts
recognized in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) for 2008 for all plans were as follows (in
millions):

Table of Contents   

Weighted-average
actuarial assumptions for our primary U.S. pension plans, which
represent substantially all of our PBO, are as follows:

(1)  
       
     The assumed interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been accrued to date (the PBO) to their net present value. 

(2)  
       
     Average future salary increases based on age and years of service. 

Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid as follows for the
years ending May 31 (in millions):

These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary
significantly from these estimates.

Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 9% during 2009,
decreasing to an annual growth rate of 5% in 2017 and thereafter. Future dental benefit costs are
estimated to increase at an annual rate of 6% during 2009, decreasing to an annual growth rate of
5% in 2013 and thereafter. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would not have a significant
impact on the APBO at May 31, 2008 or 2008 benefit expense because the level of these benefits is
capped.

NOTE 13: BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with
FedEx Services, form the core of our reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the
following businesses:

FedEx Express Segment 

FedEx Express (express transportation) 

FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services) 

FedEx Ground Segment 

FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery) 

FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator) 

FedEx Freight Segment 

FedEx Freight LTL Group: 

FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight transportation) 

FedEx National LTL (long-haul LTL freight transportation)  

FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation) 

Caribbean Transportation Services (airfreight forwarding) 

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services (sales, marketing and information technology functions) 

FedEx Office (document and business services and package
acceptance) 

FedEx Customer Information Services ( FCIS ) (customer service,
billing and collections) 

FedEx Global Supply Chain Services (logistics services) 

The FedEx
Services segment includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing and information
technology support; FCIS, which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground; FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, which provides a range of
logistics services to our customers; and FedEx Office.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to change the name of FedEx Kinko s to FedEx Office.
We believe the FedEx Office name better describes the wide range of services available at our
retail centers and takes full advantage of the FedEx brand.

During the first quarter of 2008, FedEx Office was reorganized as a part of the FedEx Services
segment. FedEx Office provides retail access to our customers for our package transportation
businesses and an array of document and business services. FedEx Services provides access to
customers through digital
channels such as fedex.com. Under FedEx Services, FedEx Office benefits from the full range of
resources and expertise of FedEx Services to continue to enhance the customer experience, provide
greater, more convenient access to the portfolio of services at FedEx, and increase revenues
through our retail network. As part of this reorganization, we are pursuing synergies in sales,
marketing, information technology and administrative areas.

With this reorganization, the FedEx Services segment became a reportable segment. Prior year
amounts have been revised to conform to the current year segment presentation. FedEx Office
continues to be treated as a reporting unit for purposes of goodwill and impairment testing.

Effective June 1, 2006, we moved FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc., the results of which were
previously reported in the FedEx Ground segment, into a new subsidiary of FedEx Services named
FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, Inc. The net operating costs of this entity are allocated to
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. Prior year amounts were not reclassified to conform to the 2007
segment presentation, as financial results were materially comparable.

116 

Table of Contents   

The costs of the sales, marketing and information technology support provided by FedEx Services and
the customer service functions of FCIS, together with the normal, ongoing net operating costs of
FedEx Global Supply Chain Services and FedEx Office, are allocated primarily to the FedEx Express
and FedEx Ground segments based on metrics such as relative revenues or estimated services
provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. The
$891 million fourth quarter charge predominantly associated with the noncash impairment charges for
the Kinko s trade name and goodwill was not allocated to the FedEx Express or FedEx Ground
segments, as this cost was unrelated to the core performance of those businesses.

Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx
companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated
rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing
segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment
revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated results and are not separately identified
in the following segment information, as the amounts are not material.

The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial
summaries of our transportation segments in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and
Financial Condition ( MD A ) includes the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the
respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes allocations
for administrative services provided between operating companies and certain other costs such as
corporate management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, including
executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. Management evaluates transportation
segment financial performance based on operating income.

     FedEx Services segment operating expenses include a charge of approximately $891
million, predominantly related to noncash impairment charges associated with the decision to
minimize the use of the Kinko s trade name and goodwill
resulting from the Kinko s acquisition. These charges were not
allocated to our transportation segments, as the charges were
unrelated to the core performance of these businesses.

NOTE 14: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Cash paid for interest expense and income taxes for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in
millions):

NOTE 15: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale or purchase of operating assets
or services in the ordinary course of business, we may provide
routine guarantees or indemnifications (e.g.,
environmental, fuel, tax and software infringement), the terms of
which range in duration, and often they are not limited and have no specified maximum
obligation. As a result, the overall
maximum potential amount of the obligation under such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be
reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make significant payments under
our guarantee or indemnification obligations and no amounts have been recognized in our financial
statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations.

Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to finance the
acquisition and construction of various airport facilities and equipment. These facilities were
leased to us and are accounted for as either capital leases or operating leases. FedEx Express has
unconditionally guaranteed $755 million in principal of these bonds (with total future principal
and interest payments of approximately $1.1 billion as of May 31, 2008) through these leases. Of
the $755 million bond principal guaranteed, $204 million was included in capital lease obligations
in our balance sheet at May 31, 2008. The remaining $551 million has been accounted for as
operating leases.

NOTE 16: COMMITMENTS

Annual purchase commitments under various contracts as of May 31, 2008 were as follows (in
millions):

(1)  
       
     Primarily aircraft modifications. 

(2)  
       
     Primarily vehicles, facilities, computers and advertising and promotions contracts. 

The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable
agreements to purchase goods or services. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger
configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport
unless we have entered into noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft. Open purchase
orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial
reporting purposes and are not included in the table above.

120

Included in our aircraft commitments are aircraft under our Boeing 757-200 ( B757 ) and Boeing 777
Freighter ( B777F ) programs. In 2007, we announced a multi-year program to acquire and modify
approximately 90 B757 aircraft to replace our narrowbody fleet of Boeing 727-200 aircraft. As of
May 31, 2008, we had entered into agreements to purchase 29 B757 aircraft, in addition to the 12 we
already owned, under this program. In addition, during 2007, we entered into an agreement to
acquire 15 new B777F aircraft and an option to purchase an additional 15 B777F aircraft. In
connection with the decision to purchase the B777F aircraft, we cancelled an order with Airbus for
10 A380-800F aircraft. In a settlement agreement with Airbus, we were provided, among other
things, credit memoranda applicable to the purchase of goods and services in the future. The net
impact of this settlement was immaterial to our 2007 results and was recorded as an operating gain
during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Deposits and progress payments of $254 million have been made toward aircraft purchases, options to
purchase additional aircraft and other planned aircraft-related transactions. Our primary aircraft
purchase commitments include the B757 in passenger configuration, which will require additional
costs to modify for cargo transport, and the new B777F aircraft. In addition, we have committed to
modify our DC10 aircraft for two-man cockpit configurations. Future payments related to these
activities are included in the table above. Aircraft and aircraft-related contracts are subject to
price escalations. The following table is a summary of the number and type of aircraft we are
committed to purchase as of May 31, 2008, with the year of expected delivery:

NOTE 17: CONTINGENCIES

Wage-and-Hour.  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits containing various class-action
allegations of wage-and-hour violations. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other
things, that they were forced to work  off the clock,  were not paid overtime or were not provided
work breaks or other benefits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages,
injunctive relief, or both.

In February 2008, one of these wage-and-hour cases,  Wiegele v. FedEx Ground , was certified as a
class action by a California federal court, and in April 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit denied our petition to review the class certification ruling. The class
certification ruling, however, does not address whether we will ultimately be held liable. The
plaintiffs in  Wiegele  represent a class of FedEx Ground sort managers and dock service managers in
California from  May 10,
2002  to present. The plaintiffs allege that FedEx Ground has misclassified
the managers as exempt from the overtime requirements of California
 wage-and-hour  laws and is
correspondingly liable for failing to pay them overtime compensation and for failing to provide
them with rest and meal breaks.

Table of Contents   

We have agreed to settle two wage-and-hour lawsuits against FedEx Ground for an immaterial amount
and executed a settlement agreement, which awaits court approval. We have denied any liability and
intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the other wage-and-hour lawsuits, including  Wiegele . We
do not believe that any loss is probable in these other lawsuits, and given the nature and status
of the claims, we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss, if any.

Independent Contractor   Estrada and Mason. Estrada v. FedEx Ground  is a class action involving
single-route contractors in California. In August 2007, the California appellate court affirmed
the trial court s ruling in  Estrada  that a limited number of California single-route contractors
(most of whom have not contracted with FedEx Ground since 2001) should be reimbursed as employees
for some of their operating expenses. The Supreme Court of California has affirmed the appellate
court s liability and class certification decisions. The case has been remanded to the trial court
for reconsideration of the amount of such reimbursable expenses and attorneys  fees. Forty of the
class members from the  Estrada  litigation have filed another lawsuit (entitled  Mason ) seeking
reimbursement of expenses for the post- Estrada 
period (January 1, 2005 to present). The forty plaintiffs continued to provide pickup-and-delivery
services to FedEx Ground after the damages period terminated in  Estrada  (December 31, 2004).
We do not expect to incur a material loss in the  Estrada  and  Mason  matters.

Independent Contractor   Other Lawsuits and State Administrative Proceedings.  FedEx Ground is
involved in approximately 45 other class-action lawsuits (including 21 that have been certified as
class actions), several individual lawsuits and approximately 30 state tax and other administrative
proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather
than independent contractors.

Most of the class-action lawsuits have been consolidated for administration of the pre-trial
proceedings by a single federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Indiana. With the exception of recently filed cases that have been or will be transferred to the
multidistrict litigation, discovery and class certification briefing are now complete. In October
2007, we received a decision from the court granting class certification in a Kansas action
alleging state law claims on behalf of a statewide class and federal law claims under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on behalf of a nationwide class. In January 2008, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit declined our request for appellate review of the class
certification decision. In March 2008, the court granted class certification in 19 additional
cases and denied it in nine cases. The court has not yet ruled on class certification in the other
cases that are pending in the multidistrict litigation. Motions for summary judgment on the
classification issue ( i.e.,  independent contractor vs. employee) are pending in all 20 of the cases
that have been certified as class actions.

In January 2008, one of the contractor-model lawsuits that is not part of the multidistrict
litigation,  Anfinson v. FedEx Ground , was certified as a class action by a Washington state court.
The plaintiffs in  Anfinson  represent a class of FedEx Ground single-route, pickup-and-delivery
owner-operators in Washington from December 21, 2001 through December 31, 2005 and allege that the
class members should be reimbursed as employees for their uniform expenses and should receive
overtime pay. The  Anfinson  case is scheduled for trial in October 2008. The other
contractor-model lawsuits that are not part of the multidistrict litigation are not as far along
procedurally as  Anfinson .

FedEx Ground is also involved in several lawsuits, including three purported class actions, brought
by drivers of the company s independent contractors who claim that they were jointly employed by
the contractor and FedEx Ground.

Adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our
contractors and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of
wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx
Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s
owner-operators. We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as
independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s
independent contractors. Given the nature and status of these lawsuits, we cannot yet determine
the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss, if any, but it is reasonably possible that such
potential loss or such changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s
owner-operators could be material. However, we do not believe that a
material loss is probable in any of
these matters.

Independent Contractor   IRS Audit.  On December 20, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS )
informed us that its audit team had concluded an audit for the 2002 calendar year regarding the
classification of owner-operators at FedEx Ground. The IRS has tentatively concluded, subject to
ongoing discussions with us, that FedEx Ground s pickup-and-delivery owner-operators should be
reclassified as employees for federal employment tax purposes. The IRS has indicated that it
anticipates assessing tax and penalties of $319 million plus interest for 2002. Substantially all
of the IRS s tentative assessment relates to employment and withholding taxes for the 2002 calendar
year and, if paid by the company, would be fully deductible. Similar issues are under audit by the
IRS for calendar years 2004
through 2006. We are in discussions with the IRS audit team and expect that a final resolution of
this matter will not occur for some time. We believe that we have strong defenses to the IRS s
tentative assessment and will vigorously defend our position, as we continue to believe that FedEx
Ground s owner-operators are independent contractors. Given the preliminary status of this matter,
we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss. However, we do not
believe that loss is probable.

Independent Contractor   Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits.  The Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 51
Pension Fund and the Western Pennsylvania Bricklayers Pension Fund have each filed shareholder
derivative lawsuits in Tennessee federal court naming FedEx Corporation as a nominal defendant and
the members of the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation as defendants (the Plumbers and
Pipefitters suit was filed in May 2008 and the Bricklayers suit was filed in June 2008). The
derivative lawsuits, which are purportedly brought to assert the rights of FedEx Corporation,
assert claims against the Board members for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment in connection with the management of
FedEx Ground   in particular, the classification of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent
contractors. Given the preliminary status of these matters, we cannot yet determine the amount or
a reasonable range of potential loss. However, we do not believe that any loss is probable.

Antitrust   FedEx Freight Fuel Surcharge.  In July 2007, a purported antitrust class-action lawsuit
was filed in California federal court, naming FedEx Corporation (particularly FedEx Freight
Corporation and its LTL freight subsidiaries) and several other major LTL freight carriers as
defendants. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates in
violation of federal antitrust laws and seeks injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys 
fees. Since the filing of the original case, numerous similar cases have been filed against us and
other LTL freight carriers, each with allegations of conspiracy to fix fuel surcharge rates along
with other related allegations. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has
consolidated these cases for administration of the pre-trial proceedings by a single federal court,
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. We do not believe that any loss is
probable, and given the nature and status of the claims, we cannot yet determine the amount or a
reasonable range of potential loss, if any, in these matters.

Other.  FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any,
with respect to these other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Additional information about our contingencies can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis.

NOTE 18: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frederick W. Smith, currently holds an
approximate 10% ownership interest in the National Football League Washington Redskins professional
football team ( Redskins ) and is a member of its board of directors. FedEx has a multi-year
naming rights agreement with the Redskins granting us certain marketing rights, including the right
to name the Redskins  stadium  FedExField. 

NOTE 19: SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

(1) 
       
     Results for the second quarter of 2007 include a $143 million charge at FedEx Express associated with upfront compensation
and benefits under the new pilot labor contract. The impact of this new contract on second quarter net income was approximately
$78 million net of tax, or $0.25 per diluted share. Additionally, FedEx National LTL s financial results have been included from
September 3, 2006 (the date of acquisition). 

(2) 
       
     Results for the fourth quarter of 2008 include a charge of approximately $891 million ($696 million, net of tax, or $2.22 per
diluted share), predominantly related to noncash impairment charges associated with the decision to minimize the use of the
Kinko s trade name and goodwill resulting from the Kinko s acquisition. The earnings per share impact of the impairment charge
differs for the fourth quarter and full year due to differences in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. 

NOTE 20: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We are required to present condensed consolidating financial information in order for the
subsidiary guarantors (other than FedEx Express) of our public debt to continue to be exempt from
reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The guarantor subsidiaries, which are wholly owned by FedEx, guarantee approximately $1.2 billion
of our debt. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Our guarantor
subsidiaries were not determined using geographic, service line or other similar criteria, and as a
result, the  Guarantor  and  Non-Guarantor  columns each include portions of our domestic and
international operations. Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not intended to present our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply with
the specific requirements for subsidiary guarantor reporting.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

INTEREST RATES.  While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest
rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the
interest rates are fixed on all of our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of
capital leases) with an estimated fair value of $1.9 billion at May 31, 2008 and $2.4 billion at
May 31, 2007. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in
fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to
approximately $27 million as of May 31, 2008 and $36 million as
 of May 31, 2007. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted
market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.

FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce and business
services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The
distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that foreign currency
declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains in other areas of the world.
The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the Chinese
yuan, euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. Our exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenues than our expenses,
as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel
expenses. During 2008 and 2007, operating income was positively impacted due to foreign currency
fluctuations. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting
impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May
31, 2008, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the
currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income
of approximately $74 million for 2009 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately
$41 million). This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the
same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.

In practice, our experience has been that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we
have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore,
the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions.
In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also
affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors  services become more
or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.

COMMODITY.  While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk
is largely mitigated by our fuel surcharges because our fuel surcharges are closely linked to
market prices for fuel. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be
expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a timing lag
(approximately six to eight weeks for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground) before they are adjusted for
changes in fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge index also allows fuel prices to fluctuate
approximately 2% for FedEx Express and approximately 4% for FedEx Ground before an adjustment to
the fuel surcharge occurs. Accordingly, our operating income may be affected should the spot price
of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change
in our fuel surcharges.

OTHER.  We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 2.  Annual Meeting . An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such
date and at such time as shall be designated by the board of directors and stated in the notice of
the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. At each annual meeting, the
stockholders shall elect directors and transact such other business as may properly be brought
before the meeting.

Section 3.  Notice of Annual Meeting . Written notice of the annual meeting stating the
place (if any), date and time of the meeting and the means of remote communication (if any) by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting
shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

Section 4.  List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote . The officer who has charge of the
stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered
in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting,
either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to
gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary
business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. If the corporation
determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders. If the meeting
is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the

than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such
meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the
purposes stated in the notice of such meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice of such
meeting.

Section 7.  Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings . Except as otherwise provided by law or
the certificate of incorporation, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of stockholders. If a quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of
stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting who are
present in person or represented by proxy or the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting
until a quorum shall be present or represented. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or
place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place (if any) thereof and
the means of remote communication (if any) by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if
after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 8.  Required Vote . When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders,
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at
the meeting and entitled to vote shall decide any question (other than the election of directors)
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law,
the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such
express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. The vote required for
the election of directors shall be as set forth in Section 1 of Article III herein.

2 

Section 9.  Voting; Proxies . Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote
in person or by proxy for each share of capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder.
At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the
stockholder or as permitted by law. Such proxy must be filed with the secretary of the corporation
or his or her representative or otherwise delivered telephonically or electronically as set forth
in the applicable proxy statement, at or before the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be voted
on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

Section 10.  Conduct of Meeting . Except to the extent inconsistent with any rules and
regulations adopted by the board of directors for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders, the
chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

Section 11.  Action Without a Meeting . Any action required or permitted to be taken by
the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Except as
otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock
having a preference over the common stock of the corporation as to dividends or upon liquidation,
special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire board of directors.

Section 12.  Nomination of Directors and Stockholder Business at Annual Meeting .
Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors or proposals of any other matter for
stockholder action may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders by any stockholder who is
entitled to vote at the meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section and who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving such notice. For business other
than a nomination to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business
must be a proper matter for stockholder action. A notice of a stockholder to make a nomination or
to bring any other matter for stockholder action before an annual meeting of stockholders shall be
made in writing and received by the secretary of the corporation not more than 120 days and not
less than ninety days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called on a date that is
not within thirty days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to
be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth
day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the first to occur of the day on which
notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual
meeting was made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting
commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above.

3 

Every such notice by a stockholder shall set forth:

(a) 
       
     the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make a nomination or bring up
any other matter; 

(b) 
       
     a representation that the stockholder is a holder of the corporation s voting stock
(indicating the class and number of shares owned) and intends to appear in person or by
proxy at the meeting to make the nomination or bring up the matter specified in the notice; 

(c) 
       
     with respect to notice of an intent to make a nomination, a description of all
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether written or oral) among the stockholder
and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant
to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; 

(d) 
       
     with respect to notice of an intent to make a nomination, the name and address of each
nominee and such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as
would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated by the
board of directors of the corporation; and 

(e) 
       
     with respect to notice of an intent to bring up any other matter, a description of the
matter, including the complete text of any resolutions intended to be presented at the
meeting, the reasons for bringing up such matter at the meeting and any personal or other
material interest of the stockholder in the matter. 

A stockholder seeking to make a nomination or bring up any other proper matter for stockholder
action before an annual meeting shall promptly provide to the corporation any other information
reasonably requested by the corporation. Notice of intent to make a nomination shall be
accompanied by (a) the written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if
so elected, and (b) a statement whether such nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly
following such election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person s failure to receive
the required vote for reelection at the next meeting at which such person would face reelection and
upon acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors in accordance with Section I of
Article III herein.

At the annual meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall declare out of order
and disregard any nomination or other matter proposed to be brought before the meeting that has not
been made in accordance with this Section.

4 

ARTICLE III. DIRECTORS 

Section 1.  Number, Election and Term of Directors . The number of directors which
shall constitute the whole board shall be not more than fifteen, with the exact number to be
determined from time to time by the board of directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders,
all directors shall be elected for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor has been duly elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier disqualification, death, resignation or removal. No decrease
in the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any
incumbent director.

A nominee for director shall be elected to the board of directors if the votes cast for such
nominee s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee s election; provided, however, that
at a contested election meeting, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the
holders of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a  contested election meeting  is any
annual meeting of stockholders for which (a) the secretary of the corporation receives a notice
that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the board of directors in compliance with
the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Section 12 of
Article II herein, and (b) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior
to the tenth day preceding the date the corporation first gives notice of such meeting to the
stockholders, as required by Section 3 of Article II herein.

The board of directors shall not nominate for election as director any candidate who has not
agreed to tender, promptly following the annual meeting at which he or she is elected as director,
an irrevocable resignation that will be effective upon (a) the failure to receive the required
number of votes for reelection at the next annual meeting of stockholders at which he or she faces
reelection, and (b) acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors. In addition, the
board of directors shall not fill a director vacancy or newly created directorship with any
candidate who has not agreed to tender, promptly following his or her appointment to the board, the
same form of resignation.

If a director nominee fails to receive the required number of votes for reelection, the board
of directors (excluding the director in question) shall, within 90 days after certification of the
election results, decide whether to accept the director s resignation. Absent a compelling reason
for the director to remain on the board of directors, the board shall accept the resignation. The
board of directors shall promptly disclose its decision and, if applicable, the reasons for
rejecting the resignation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section 2.  Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies . Vacancies and newly created
directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, unless sooner displaced.
If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner
provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the
directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted
immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any
stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the total number of shares at the time
outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to
fill any such
vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then
in office.

5 

Section 3.  Powers . The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or
under the direction of the board of directors, which may exercise all the powers of the
corporation, subject to the restrictions imposed by law, the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws.

Section 4.  Place of Meetings; Minutes . The board of directors may hold meetings, both
regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware, and shall cause minutes of its
proceedings to be prepared and placed in the minute books of the corporation.

Section 5.  Regular Meetings . Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held
without notice at such time and at such place as shall be determined by the board.

Section 6.  Special Meetings . Special meetings of the board may be called by the
chairman of the board or the chief executive officer upon notice to each director and shall be
called by the chairman of the board, chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on
like notice on the written request of two or more directors. Neither the business to be transacted
at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of the board need be specified in the notice of such
meeting.

Section 7.  Quorum; Required Vote; Adjournment . At all meetings of the board a
majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum
shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law
or the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board
of directors, the directors present may adjourn the meeting, without notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

Section 8.  Action Without a Meeting . Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate
of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members
of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed
with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

Section 9.  Board Committees . The board of directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors appointed by the board of directors.
The number of committee members may be increased or decreased by the board of directors. Each
committee member shall serve as such until the earliest of the expiration of his or her term as a
director or his or her death or resignation or removal as a committee member or as a director. The
board of directors shall have the power at any time to fill vacancies in, to change the membership
of and to discharge any committee. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the
committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act
at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

6 

Section 10.  Committee Authority . Any such committee shall have and may exercise all
the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of
the corporation as may be delegated to it by the board of directors, except to the extent expressly
restricted by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. Each committee shall have
such name as may be determined by the board of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, these bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors, each
committee may form and delegate authority to any subcommittee as it deems appropriate or advisable.

Section 11.  Committee Procedure and Meetings . Each committee shall cause minutes of
its proceedings to be prepared and shall report the same to the board of directors when requested.
Unless the board of directors otherwise provides, each committee may determine its own rules and
procedures for the conduct of its business. At every meeting of a board committee, fifty percent
or more of the total number of members shall constitute a quorum and the act of a majority of the
members present at such meeting shall be the act of the committee.

Section 12.  Compensation . Directors and members of committees may receive such
compensation for their services and such reimbursement for their expenses as the board of directors
shall determine.

Section 13.  Stockholder Rights Plans . Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the
contrary, the board of directors may adopt a stockholder rights plan only if, prior to the adoption
of the plan by the board of directors, at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present,
the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting
and entitled to vote have approved the adoption of the stockholder rights plan; provided, however,
that the board of directors may adopt a stockholder rights plan without prior stockholder approval
if the board determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, that it would be in the best
interests of the corporation and its stockholders to adopt the plan without such stockholder
approval. Any stockholder rights plan so adopted by the board of directors without prior
stockholder approval shall expire no later than one year following the date of its adoption unless
the stockholder rights plan is ratified, at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present,
by the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote.  Stockholder rights plan  refers in this Section to any stockholder rights plan or
stockholder rights agreement generally referred to as a  poison pill  and designed to make
acquisitions of large holdings of the corporation s shares of stock more expensive.

ARTICLE IV. NOTICES 

Section 1.  Method . Whenever notice is required by law, the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws to be given to any director, committee member or stockholder,
personal notice shall not be required and any such notice may be given in writing (a) by mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to such director, committee member or stockholder at his or her address
as it appears on
the records of the corporation, or (b) by any other method permitted by law (including, but not
limited to, overnight courier service, facsimile, electronic mail or other means of electronic
transmission). Any notice given by mail shall be deemed to have been given when deposited in the
United States mail as set forth above. Any notice given by overnight courier service shall be
deemed to have been given when delivered to such service with all charges prepaid and addressed as
set forth above.

Section 2.  Waiver . Whenever notice is required by law, the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws to be given to any director, committee member or stockholder, a
waiver thereof in writing signed by the person entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated
therein, shall be equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such person attends for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors or a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so
required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

7 

ARTICLE V. OFFICERS 

Section 1.  Titles; Election; Term of Office . The officers of the corporation shall be
a president, secretary and such other officers as the board of directors may elect or appoint,
including, without limitation, a chairman of the board, a chief executive officer, one or more vice
presidents (with each vice president to have such descriptive title, if any, as the board of
directors shall determine), a treasurer, one or more assistant secretaries and one or more
assistant treasurers. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor has been duly
elected and qualified or, if earlier, until his or her death, resignation or removal. Any two or
more offices may be held by the same person. Except for the chairman of the board, none of the
officers need be a director of the corporation. The chairman of the board shall be the chief
executive officer of the corporation, unless the board of directors designates a different officer
as chief executive officer.

Section 2.  Removal . The board of directors may remove any officer of the corporation
with or without cause at any time. Election or appointment of an officer shall not of itself
create contract rights.

Section 3.  Vacancies . Any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation shall be
filled by the board of directors.

Section 4.  Powers and Duties . Officers shall have such powers and duties in the
management of the corporation as (a) are provided in these bylaws, (b) may be prescribed by the
board of directors or by an officer authorized to do so by the board, and (c) generally pertain to
their respective offices, subject to the control of the board of directors and any officer to whom
they report. One officer shall have responsibility for keeping the minutes of all proceedings of
the board of directors, board committees and stockholders in books provided for that purpose, and
shall attend to the giving and service of all notices.

Section 5.  Compensation . The compensation of officers shall be determined by the
board of directors; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided by law, the board of
directors may delegate the power to determine the compensation of any officer (other than the
officer to whom such power is delegated) to the independent members of the board, a committee of
the board, the chairman of the board, the president or such other officers as may be designated by
the board or a committee of the board.

8 

ARTICLE VI. INDEMNIFICATION 

Section 1.  Rights to Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, (a) indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made
a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a director, officer or managing director (or its equivalent) of the
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys  fees) reasonably
incurred by such person in connection therewith, and (b) pay the expenses (including attorneys 
fees) incurred by any such person in defending any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of
its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of expenses incurred by a person in
advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt
of an undertaking by the person to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined
that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise. The corporation
shall be required to indemnify and advance expenses to any such person in connection with an
action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation.

Section 2.  Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights to indemnification and the
advancement of expenses, as conferred on any person by the provisions of this Article, shall not be

law, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

Section 3.  Nature of Rights . The rights to indemnification and the advancement of
expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer or managing director (or its equivalent) and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. The provisions of this Article
shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director who serves in such
capacity at any time while this Article is in effect, and any repeal or modification hereof shall
not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or any
action, suit or proceeding then or theretofore existing, or any action, suit or proceeding
thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part on any such state of facts.

provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Section 5.  Registered Stockholders . The corporation shall be entitled to treat the
holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly,

illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations
of the stockholders would not be materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be
fully separable, and these bylaws shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the remaining provisions of these bylaws
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of these bylaws, a legal,
valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

Section 11.  Headings . The headings used in these bylaws have been inserted for
administrative convenience only and do not constitute matter to be construed in interpretation.

vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Notwithstanding
the first sentence of this Article VIII and anything contained in these bylaws to the contrary,

the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Notwithstanding anything contained
in
these bylaws to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the

relating to a Restricted Stock Award may provide for a tax reimbursement cash payment to be made by
the Company in favor of any Participant in connection with the tax consequences resulting from a
Restricted Stock Award, the lapse of restrictions on any Restricted Shares or the payment by a
Participant of any taxes related thereto, subject to such conditions as the Committee may specify.

restrictions imposed pursuant to  Section 8(a)  on Restricted Shares shall terminate with

restrictions shall lapse less than six months from the date of award in the event of (2) and (3)
below, unless otherwise specified by the Committee:

(1) the expiration of the Restriction Period (including pursuant to  Section 15(b)(1) 
below);

(2) the Participant s retirement at or after the age of 60;

(3) the Participant s permanent disability; or

(4) the Participant s death.

Upon the termination of such restrictions, the shares of Common Stock shall be released from escrow
and delivered to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant s death, the Participant s
personal representative and, if such shares are represented by a certificate, any legend on such
certificates shall be removed.

(a)  Limit on Awards . No Participant shall receive Stock Options for more than 600,000
shares of Common Stock during any fiscal year of the Company.

(b)  Agreements . Each Stock Option will be evidenced by a written agreement, in such

conditions and other provisions of the Stock Option, including the number of shares of Common Stock

5 

(c)  Terms and Conditions . All Stock Options shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions and to such other terms and conditions consistent with the terms of the Plan as the
Committee shall determine:

(1)  Option Price.  The exercise price per share shall be determined by the Committee, but
shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The
 Fair Market Value  of the Common Stock on a particular date shall mean, for all purposes under the
Plan, the average of the high and low sales prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange composite tape on that date. In the event that such method for determining Fair
Market Value is not practicable, then the Committee shall determine the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock in such manner as it deems appropriate.

(2)  Time of Exercise of Option.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, each Stock
Option shall be exercisable during and over such period ending not later than ten years from the
grant date. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no Stock Option shall be exercisable
prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, except as provided in   Sections 9(c)(4)  
and  15(b)(2)  below.

(3)  Method of Exercise and Payment.  Each Stock Option may be exercised by giving written
notice to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased and accompanied by payment in
full (including applicable taxes, if any) in cash therefor. No Participant shall have any rights
to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to shares subject to his or her Stock
Option until he or she has given written notice of exercise, paid in full for such shares and, if
requested, given the representation described in  Section 10  below.

(4)  Rights After Termination of Employment. 

(i)   Retirement   .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant s
employment or directorship terminates by reason of his or her retirement, the Participant s Stock
Option will continue to vest in accordance with its terms and may be exercised until the expiration
of the stated period of the Stock Option;  provided  ,   however , that if the
Participant dies after such termination of employment or directorship, any unexercised Stock
Option, to the extent to which it was exercisable at the time of the Participant s death, may
thereafter be exercised by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the Stock
Option under the last will for a period of twelve months from the date of the Participant s death
or the expiration of the stated period of the Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter.

(ii)   Disability   .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant s
employment or directorship terminates by reason of permanent disability, the Participant s Stock
Option may thereafter be exercised in full (except that no Stock Option may be exercised less than
six months from the grant date) for a period of twenty-four months from the date of such
termination of employment or directorship or the stated period of the Stock Option, whichever
period is the shorter;  provided  ,   however , that if the Participant dies within a
period of twenty-four months after such termination of employment or directorship, any outstanding
Stock Option may thereafter be exercised by the legal representative of the estate or by the
legatee of the Stock Option under the last will for a period of twelve months from the date of the
Participant s death or the expiration of the stated period of the Stock Option, whichever period is
the shorter.

6 

(iii)   Death   .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant s
employment or directorship terminates by reason of the Participant s death, the Participant s Stock
Option may thereafter be exercised in full by the legal representative of the estate or by the
legatee of the Stock Option under the last will for a period of twelve months from the date of the
Participant s death or the expiration of the stated period of the Stock Option, whichever period is
the shorter.

(iv)   Other   .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant s
employment or directorship terminates for any reason other than death, retirement or permanent
disability, the Participant s Stock Option shall thereupon terminate.

(d)  Grant of Stock Options to Non-Management Directors . Non-Management Directors
shall not be eligible to receive any Awards other than Stock Options as specified in this
 Section 9(d) .

(1)  Discretionary Awards.  The Committee may grant a Non-Qualified Option to any
Non-Management Director for such number of shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine;
 provided ,  however , that such grants of Non-Qualified Options only may be made (i)
immediately following an annual meeting of the Company s stockholders to any of the Non-Management
Directors who are then incumbent after such meeting and (ii) in connection with a Non-Management
Director s election or appointment to the Board of Directors if other than at an annual meeting.

(2)  Terms and Conditions of Stock Options.  The Committee shall establish the terms and
conditions of Non-Qualified Options granted to Non-Management Directors,  provided , that any
Non-Qualified Option granted to a Non-Management Director (i) shall have an exercise price per
share not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and (ii)
shall not be exercisable earlier than one year from the date of grant, except as provided in
 Sections 9(c)(4)  and  15(b)(2) . Unless otherwise provided in the Plan, all
provisions of the Plan with respect to the terms of Non-Qualified Options granted to employees
shall be applicable to Non-Qualified Options granted to Non-Management Directors.

(e)  Designation of Certain Options as Incentive Stock Options . Stock Options, or
portions thereof, granted to employees may in the discretion of the Committee be designated as
Incentive Stock Options. In addition to the other applicable terms and conditions contained in
this  Section 9 , the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock covered by an
Incentive Stock Option (determined at the time the Stock Option is granted) with respect to which
an Incentive Stock Option is exercisable for the first time by any individual Participant during
any calendar year (under the Plan and all other similar plans of the Company and its subsidiaries)
shall not exceed $100,000 (or such other amount as may be specified by Section 422(d) of the Code).

(f)  Transferability Restriction . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a
Stock Option by its terms shall be personal and may not be sold, pledged, assigned, exchanged,
encumbered, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner by the Participant other than by
will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During a Participant s lifetime, only the
Participant or a duly appointed legal representative may exercise the Stock Option, unless
otherwise determined by the Committee.

7 

(g)  Repricing Prohibited . Neither the Committee nor the Company shall  reprice 
outstanding Stock Options for any reason. For purposes of the Plan, a  repricing  means lowering
the exercise price per share of an outstanding Stock Option or any other action that has the same
effect or is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles and includes,
without limitation, a tandem cancellation of a Stock Option at a time when its exercise price per
share exceeds the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock and exchange for another option
or other equity security (unless such cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger,
acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction).

(h)  Use of Proceeds . Proceeds received by the Company pursuant to the exercise of
Stock Options shall constitute general funds of the Company.

10. Compliance with Applicable Laws; Investment Representation 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any agreement relating to a particular
Award, the Company shall have no obligation to issue any shares of Common Stock under the Plan
unless such issuance would comply with all applicable laws and the applicable requirements of any
securities exchange or similar entity. Prior to the issuance of any shares of Common Stock under
the Plan, the Company may require a written statement that the Participant is acquiring such shares
for his or her own account for investment and not for the purpose or with the intention of
distributing the shares or any part thereof. Certificates representing shares of Common Stock
issued under the Plan may bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order
to assure compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations and to reflect any

For purposes of the Plan, (a) a transfer of an employee from the Company to a subsidiary, or

issuance of Common Stock pursuant to an Award) are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes,
and the Committee may condition the delivery of any Award or the issuance of any Common Stock

13. Prohibition on Loans

(c) the exercise prices and the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Stock Options and
(d) such other terms of Awards as the Committee deems appropriate, shall be approximately and

15. Change of Control 

(a)  Definition . For purposes of the Plan, the term  Change of Control  means the
occurrence of any of the following events following the effective date of the Plan:

(1) Any  person  (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14 of the Exchange Act), other
than (i) the Company, (ii) any subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any employee benefit plan (or a
trust forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, (iv) any
underwriter temporarily holding securities of the Company pursuant to an offering of such
securities or (v) any person in connection with a transaction described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of  Section 15(a)(2)  below, becomes the  beneficial owner  (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the
total voting power of the Company s then outstanding voting securities, unless such securities (or,
if applicable, securities that are being converted into voting securities) are acquired directly
from the Company in a transaction approved by a majority of the Incumbent Board (as defined below).

(2) The consummation of a merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the Company or
in which securities of the Company are issued, or the sale or other disposition, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a  Corporate
Transaction ), unless:

(i) the stockholders of the Company immediately before such Corporate Transaction will own,
directly or indirectly, immediately following such Corporate Transaction, at least 60% of the total
voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation or other entity resulting from
such Corporate Transaction (including a corporation or other entity that acquires all or
substantially all of the Company s assets, the  Surviving Company ) or the ultimate parent company
thereof in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the voting securities of the
Company immediately before such Corporate Transaction;

9 

(ii) the individuals who were members of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement providing for such Corporate Transaction constitute a majority of the
members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the Surviving Company or the
ultimate parent company thereof; and

(iii) no person, other than (A) the Company, (B) any subsidiary of the Company, (C) any
employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, (D) the Surviving Company, (E) any subsidiary or parent company of the
Surviving Company, or (F) any person who, immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, was the
beneficial owner of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the total voting power of
the Company s then outstanding voting securities, is the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the
total voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving Company or the
ultimate parent company thereof.

(3) The stockholders of the Company approve a complete liquidation or dissolution of the
Company.

(4) Directors who, as of the effective date of the Plan, constitute the Board of Directors
(the  Incumbent Board ), cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors (or, in
the event of any merger, consolidation or reorganization the principal purpose of which is to
change the Company s state of incorporation, form a holding company or effect a similar
reorganization as to form, the board of directors of such surviving company or its ultimate parent
company);  provided ,  however , that any individual becoming a member of the Board of
Directors subsequent to the effective date of the Plan whose election, or nomination for election
by the Company s stockholders, was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors then
comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the
Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election
of directors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control will not be deemed to occur solely because
any person (a  Subject Person ) becomes the beneficial owner of more than the permitted amount of
the outstanding voting securities of the Company as a result of the acquisition of voting
securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of voting securities outstanding, increases
the proportional number of voting securities beneficially owned by the Subject Person,
 provided , that if a Change of Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence)
as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Company, and after such acquisition by
the Company, the Subject Person becomes the beneficial owner of any additional voting securities
that increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities beneficially owned by the
Subject Person to 30% or more of the total voting power, then a Change of Control will have
occurred.

10 

(b)  Effect of Change of Control . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
upon a Change of Control:

(1)  Restricted Shares.  In the event of a Change of Control as described in
 Section 15(a)(2) , as shall be determined by the Committee: (i) any Restricted Shares shall
be canceled and the Company shall make a cash payment to those Participants in an amount equal
to the highest price per share received by the holders of Common Stock in connection with such
Change of Control multiplied by the number of Restricted Shares then held by such Participant, with
any non-cash consideration to be valued in good faith by the Committee; or (ii) the Restriction
Periods with respect to all outstanding Restricted Shares shall immediately lapse. In the event of
a Change of Control as described in  Section 15(a)(1) ,  (3)  or  (4) , the
Restriction Periods with respect to all outstanding Restricted Shares shall immediately lapse.

(2)  Stock Options . In the event of a Change of Control, all outstanding Stock Options shall
become fully vested and immediately exercisable. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
any Participant whose employment or directorship terminates following a Change of Control may
exercise his or her Stock Option in full for a period ending on the earlier of the date of
expiration of such Stock Option or the date which is twelve months after such termination of
employment or directorship.

(c)  Deemed Change of Control . If the Company enters into an agreement or series of
agreements or the Board of Directors adopts a resolution that results in the occurrence of a Change
of Control, and the employment or directorship of a Participant is terminated after the entering
into of such agreement or series of agreements or the adoption of such resolution, then, upon the
occurrence of the Change of Control, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have retroactively
occurred on the date of entering into of the earliest of such agreements or the adoption of such
resolution.

16. Amendments 

The Board of Directors or the Committee may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time and the
Committee may amend or modify the Plan and amend, modify, cancel or suspend any Award at any time
and from time to time;  provided ,  however , that without the consent of the
Participant affected, no such suspension, termination, cancellation, amendment or modification may
materially impair the rights of any Participant under any Award theretofore granted, except as
provided in  Section 17  below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the requisite vote of
the Company s stockholders, no such amendment or modification may:

(a) increase the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan pursuant to
 Section 6 ;

(b) expand the type of Awards available under the Plan;

(c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to receive Awards;

(d) extend the term of the Plan;

(e) materially change the method of determining the exercise price per share of Stock Options;

(f)  reprice  an outstanding Stock Option;

(g) increase the maximum number of shares subject to Stock Options that may be granted to a
Participant; or

(h) delete or limit the provisions of  Section 9(g)  (repricing prohibition) or
 Section 13  (loan prohibition).

In addition, any  material revision  of the Plan (within the meaning of the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange) not listed in  Sections 16(a)  through  (h)  above also shall require
the requisite vote of the Company s stockholders.

11 

17. Cancellation of Outstanding Options 

If the Committee, after consulting with management of the Company, determines that application
of an accounting standard in compliance with any statement issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board concerning the treatment of Stock Options would have a significant adverse effect
on the Company s financial statements because of the fact that Stock Options granted before the
issuance of such statement are subject to new accounting rules, then the Committee in its absolute
discretion may cancel and revoke all outstanding Stock Options to which such adverse effect is
attributed and the holders of such Stock Options shall have no further rights in respect thereof.
Such cancellation and revocation shall be effective upon written notice by the Committee to the
holders of such Stock Options.

18. Foreign Jurisdictions 

Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries outside of the United States may have such terms and conditions different
from those specified in the Plan and such additional terms and conditions as the Committee, in its
judgment, determines to be necessary, appropriate or desirable to foster and promote achievement of
the material purposes of the Plan and to fairly accommodate for differences in local law, tax
policy or custom or to facilitate administration of the Plan. The Committee may approve such
sub-plans, appendices or supplements to, or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of,
the Plan as it may consider necessary, appropriate or desirable, without thereby affecting the
terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose. The special terms and any appendices,
supplements, amendments, restatements or alternative versions, however, shall not include any
provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan as then in effect, unless the Plan
could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the Company s
stockholders.

19. Compliance with Section 16(b) 

With respect to Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ( Reporting
Persons ), transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. All transactions under the Plan involving Reporting Persons are
subject to such conditions, regardless of whether the conditions are expressly set forth in the
Plan. Any provision of the Plan that is contrary to a condition of Rule 16b-3 shall not apply to
such Reporting Persons.

5.  Forfeiture of Restricted Shares . In the event that the Participant s employment
by the Company or a subsidiary terminates for any reason other than his or her death, retirement
or permanent disability, such event shall constitute an  Event of Forfeiture  and all Shares
which at that time are Restricted Shares shall thereupon be forfeited by the Participant to the

Internal Revenue Code with respect to the grant of the Shares, pay for the benefit of the
Participant a bonus equal to the gross amount of Federal income taxes, Medicare tax and loss of
itemized deduction for such Federal income taxes for which the Participant has incurred a
liability solely as a result of the grant of the Shares, the making of such election and the
payment of such bonus. All of such payment shall be made in the form of Federal income tax
withholding payments on or before December 31, 20

manner as the Company shall prescribe.

Exhibit 10.35  

FEDEX CORPORATION 

RETIREMENT PARITY PENSION PLAN 

Effective Date 

June 1, 1993 

As Amended and Restated 

Effective June 1, 2008 

Section 1. Purpose and Description . Federal Express Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the  Company ), established, effective June 1, 1993 (the  Effective Date ), the
Federal Express Corporation Retirement Parity Pension Plan (the  Plan ). The Plan was amended,
effective June 1, 1994, to increase the benefit provided from 80% to 100% of the difference of the
 Unreduced Benefit  less the  Maximum Benefit,  as both terms are defined below. The Plan was
amended and restated, effective June 1, 1996 to provide for the inclusion of Managing Directors, in
addition to Officers, under the terms of the Plan. The Plan was restated, effective February 1,
1998 to provide for the inclusion of Managing Directors and Officers of FedEx Corporation (formerly
FDX Corporation) and, effective December 1, 1998, Managing Directors and Officers of FedEx Global
Logistics, Inc. (formerly FDX Global Logistics, Inc.), under the terms of the Plan. The Plan was
restated, effective June 1, 1999, to conform the Plan to previous amendments and to provide that,
upon retirement, an eligible Officer or Managing Director may elect certain lump-sum and
installment distributions in lieu of receiving benefits in the same manner as such benefits would
be paid from the Qualified Pension Plan. The Plan provisions, as in effect immediately prior to
June 1, 1999, remained in effect for anyone who was not actively employed by the Company, FedEx
Corporation, or FedEx Global Logistics, Inc. as an Officer or Managing Director on or after that
date, unless the Plan specifically provides otherwise.

Effective May 31, 2003, the FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. and Certain Affiliates
401(a)(17) Benefit Plan and the FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. and Certain Affiliates Excess
Plan were merged with and into the Plan and name of the Plan was changed to the FedEx Corporation
Retirement Parity Pension Plan. The provisions of the merged plan applicable to the employees
participating in the FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. and Certain Affiliates 401(a)(17) Benefit
Plan continue to be set forth in Appendix A and the FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. and Certain
Affiliates Excess Plan continue to be set forth in Appendix B. The provisions of Appendix A and
Appendix B are applicable to the employees of FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., FedEx Custom
Critical, Inc., FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc., AutoQuik, Inc. and Urgent Freight, Inc.

Effective June 1, 2003, the Plan was amended in order to establish the provisions applicable
to that portion of an eligible Officer s or Managing Director s accrued benefit which is determined
pursuant to Appendix E of the Qualified Pension Plan ( Portable Pension Account ) beginning on or
after June 1, 2003.

The Plan is hereby restated, effective June 1, 2008, to conform the Plan to the terms of the
Qualified Pension Plan and to provide for benefit accruals and benefit payments beginning June 1,
2008.

The Plan is intended to be an  employee benefit pension plan,  as defined in   3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ), and a plan that is  unfunded and is
maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees,  as provided in    201, 301 and 401 of ERISA and the
Department of Labor regulations promulgated under ERISA and is intended to comply with Internal
Revenue Code   409A. The benefits provided by the Plan are not funded, but shall
be payable when due out of the assets of the Company as general, unsecured obligations of the
Company.

Unless otherwise provided herein, defined terms used in this Plan shall have the same meaning
attributed to such terms in the Qualified Pension Plan and the Federal Express Corporation
Nonqualified Disability Plan for Officers (the  Officers Nonqualified Disability Plan ), as
applicable.

Section 2. Eligibility . Prior to June 1, 2008, any employee of a participating

account.

Any Eligible Employee of a Sponsoring Employer who, as of June 1, 2008 or later, serves as an

Portable Pension Account benefits accrued by an eligible Officer or Managing Director on or

(c) An Officer or Managing Director who meets the eligibility requirements of Section 2 above
and who has an accrued benefit under the Traditional Pension Benefit (as that term is defined in
Section 1.12 of Appendix E to the Qualified Pension Plan or Section 1.12 of Appendix G to the
Qualified Pension Plan) provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall, regardless of whether such
benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan has been reduced due to the limits imposed by Internal
Revenue Code ( Code )   415 (limitations on benefits) or   401(a)(17) (limitations on annual
compensation), be paid from the Plan a benefit equal to 100% of the difference between the
Unreduced Benefit and the Maximum Benefit.

For the purpose of this Section 3, the monthly  Unreduced Benefit  shall mean the benefit that
would be provided to the Officer or Managing Director pursuant to the Traditional Pension Benefit
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan, except that (1) if applicable, the Unreduced Benefit
shall be calculated without regard to the limits imposed by Internal Revenue Code (the  Code )  
415 (limitations on benefits) and   401(a)(17) (annual compensation limit), and (2)  Average
Compensation  taken into account with respect to a participating Officer or Managing Director shall
have the same meaning as set forth under the Qualified Pension Plan, but shall not be limited by
the application of Code   401(a)(17), except that, with respect to Officers or Managing Directors
who (i) are actively employed by a participating employer as Officers or Managing Directors on or
after June 1, 1999, (ii) except for those employees who are Officers or Managing Directors as of
April 27, 2000, are not Officers or Managing Directors the terms of whose employment are governed

For the purpose of this Section 3, the monthly  Maximum Benefit  shall mean the benefit
actually provided to the Officer or Managing Director under the Traditional Pension Benefit
provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan.

(d) In addition to the benefit described in subsection (3)(c) above, with respect to that
portion of the accrued benefit of an Officer who meets the eligibility requirements of Section 2
above and who has an accrued benefit under the Traditional Pension Benefit provisions of the
Qualified Pension Plan, shall also be paid from this Plan the difference between such Officer s
Maximum Benefit under the Traditional Pension Benefit provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan and
what such Officer s Maximum Benefit would have been had such Officer received credit for a Year of
Service under the Traditional Pension Benefit provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan for each
year that such Officer is eligible to receive, and does in fact receive, a benefit under the
Federal Express Corporation Nonqualified Disability Plan for Officers, as it currently exists or as
it may be amended from time to time (the  Officers Nonqualified Disability Plan ).

For purposes of determining eligibility for an increased benefit as contemplated by this
subsection, such increased benefit shall be provided for each Plan Year during which an Officer s
Hours of Service under the Qualified Pension Plan plus such Officer s  Phantom Hours of Service 
while receiving benefits under the Officers Nonqualified Disability Plan are equal to
a Year of Service under the Qualified Pension Plan. Phantom Hours of Service shall be credited at
the same rate under this subsection as if the Officer receiving benefits under the Officers
Nonqualified Disability Plan had been actively at work and receiving credit for Hours of Service
under the Qualified Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the above, an Officer shall not receive credit
under this subsection for the same Plan Year for which such Officer receives credit for a Year of
Service under the Qualified Pension Plan.

(e) The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the benefit payable from this Plan to an
employee who was an Officer or Managing Director as of April 27, 2000 and the terms of whose
employment are governed by the Agreement (or any successor agreement thereto) and who, as of May
31, 1999, had an accrued benefit under this Plan, shall be reduced by the total amount of pension
benefits payable to such Officer or Managing Director under the Federal Express Corporation Pilots 
Money Purchase Pension Plan, the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Section 415 Excess
Pension Plan for Pilots and the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Pension Plan for Pilots,
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement (or any successor agreement thereto).

(f) Except as specifically provided herein, this Plan is not intended to provide any increased
benefit which could otherwise be provided under the Qualified Pension Plan. An Officer s or
Managing Director s benefit under this Plan shall be decreased to the extent that such Officer s or
Managing Director s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan is so increased.

Section 4.   Benefit Amount and Limitations: Parity Portable Pension Account
Benefit .

(a) An Officer or Managing Director who meets the eligibility requirements of Section 2 above
and who has an accrued benefit under the Portable Pension Account (as that term is defined in
Section 1.06 of Appendix E to the Qualified Pension Plan or Section 1.06 of Appendix G to the
Qualified Pension Plan) provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan shall, regardless of whether such
benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan has been reduced due to the limits imposed by Internal
Revenue Code ( Code ) Section 415 (limitations on benefits) or Section 401(a)(17) (limitations on
annual compensation), be paid from the Plan a benefit equal to his/her Parity Portable Pension

as follows: 

(A) 
       
     is the Compensation Credit for such Plan Year as calculated
under the Qualified Pension Plan but without regard to the limit imposed by
Code  401(a)(17) (annual compensation limit) and subject to the provisions in
subsections (1) and (2): 

(1) 
       
     for Officers and Managing Directors who become
participants in this Plan on or before June 1, 2008 (except Managing
Directors of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., FedEx Truckload Brokerage, Inc,
and FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc. who become participants in the Plan
as of June 1, 2008) with retroactive credits as if the Officer or Managing
Director had been a participant in this Plan as of the date he participated
in the Qualified Pension Plan. 

(2) 
       
     for all Managing Directors of FedEx Custom Critical,
Inc., FedEx Truckload Brokerage, Inc, and FedEx Supply Chain Services, Inc.
who become participants in the Plan as of June 1, 2008 and all other
Managing Directors and Officers who become participants of this Plan after
June 1, 2008, only for Plan Years ending after the later of (i) June 1,
2008 and (ii) the date such employee becomes an Officer or Managing
Director. 

(B) 
       
     is the Compensation Credit accrued under the Qualified Pension
Plan for such Plan Year. 

(ii) 
       
      Parity Transition Credit  for any Plan Year beginning on or after June
1, 2008 shall equal (A) minus (B) as follows:

     is the Transition Credit for such Plan Year as calculated under
the Qualified Pension Plan but without regard to the limit imposed by Code
Section 401(a)(17) (annual compensation limit) 

(B) 
       
     is the Transition Credit accrued under the Qualified Pension
Plan for such Plan Year. 

(iii) 
       
      Additional Compensation Credit  for any Plan Year beginning on or after
June 1, 2008 shall equal 3.5% of the excess of (A) over (B), where 

(A) 
       
     is such Officer s or Managing Director s Compensation, but
without regard to the limitations under   401(a)(17), and 

(B) 
       
     is the limit set forth under   401(a)(17) of the Internal
Revenue Code (annual compensation limit). 

Additional Compensation Credits shall not be accrued for any Plan Years before June
1, 2008. 

(iv) 
       
      Parity Interest Credit  shall mean an amount credited to the Parity
Portable Pension Account in the same manner and using the same Interest Credit Factor
as in the Qualified Pension Plan. 

(v) 
       
      415 Limit Credit  shall mean, for a participant whose total Qualified
Pension Plan Benefit has been limited by  415 of the Internal Revenue Code, a cash
balance value equal to the value of the shortfall in the Qualified Pension Plan, except to
the extent already provided in Section 3, above. 

(b) In addition to the benefit described in subsection (a) above, with respect to that portion
of the accrued benefit of an Officer who meets the eligibility requirements of Section 2 above and
who has an accrued benefit under the Portable Pension Account provisions of the Qualified Pension

Portable Pension Account provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan and the amount such Officer s
Qualified Pension Plan benefit would have been had such Officer received credit for a Year of
Service under the Portable Pension Account provisions of the Qualified Pension Plan for each year
that such Officer is eligible to receive, and does in fact receive, a benefit under the Federal
Express Corporation Nonqualified Disability Plan for Officers, as it currently exists or as it may
be amended from time to time (the  Officers Nonqualified Disability Plan ).

For purposes of determining eligibility for an increased benefit as contemplated by this
subsection, such increased benefit shall be provided for each Plan Year during which an Officer s
Hours of Service under the Qualified Pension Plan plus such Officer s  Phantom Hours of Service 
while receiving benefits under the Officers Nonqualified Disability Plan are equal to a Year of
Service under the Qualified Pension Plan. Phantom Hours of Service shall be credited at the same
rate under this subsection as if the Officer receiving benefits under the Officers Nonqualified
Disability Plan had been actively at work and receiving credit for Hours of Service under the
Qualified Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the above, an Officer shall not receive credit under this
subsection for the same Plan Year for which such Officer receives credit for a Year of Service
under the Qualified Pension Plan.

(c) The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, no individual shall be entitled to receive
a Parity Compensation Credit, Parity Transition Credit or Additional Compensation Credit under this
Plan for a Plan Year unless (i) s/he is an eligible Officer or Managing Director as of the last day
of the Plan Year for which such credits would be accrued, or (ii) s/he incurs a Separation From
Service as a Managing Director or Officer after having been credited with at least 1,000 Hours of
Service in the Plan Year.

(d) The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the benefit payable from this Plan to an
employee who was an Officer or Managing Director as of April 27, 2000 and the terms of whose
employment are governed by the Agreement (or any successor agreement thereto) and who, as of May

Money Purchase Pension Plan, the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Section 415 Excess
Pension Plan for Pilots and the Federal Express Corporation Non-Qualified Pension Plan for Pilots,
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement (or any successor agreement thereto).

(e) Except as specifically provided herein, this Plan is not intended to provide any increased
benefit which could otherwise be provided under the Qualified Pension Plan. An
Officer s or Managing Director s benefit under this Plan shall be decreased to the extent that such
Officer s or Managing Director s benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan is so increased.

Section 5. Payment of Benefits: Benefits Accrued Prior to January 1, 2005, but Commencing
Prior to January 1, 2009 .

(a) Unless an eligible Officer or Managing Director makes an election in the manner and within
the time period specified in subsection (b) below, benefits under this Plan shall be paid in the
same manner and at the same time as benefit payments under the Qualified Pension Plan and shall be
subject to the same restrictions and limitations as provided therein, without regard to Code    415
and 401(a)(17). The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Officers of FedEx Custom Critical,
Inc., AutoQuik, Inc. UrgentFreight, Inc., FedEx Truckload Brokerage, Inc. and FedEx Supply Chain
Services, Inc.) are not eligible to make a lump sum election.

An eligible Officer or Managing Director shall, no later than twelve (12) months prior to the date
on which benefits commence under the Qualified Pension Plan, elect one of the following options
under which benefits shall be payable under this Plan. An eligible Officer or Managing Director
may elect to receive his or her benefit:

(i) 
       
     in a single lump sum, payable on the date on which benefit payments commence
under the Qualified Pension Plan; 

(ii) 
       
     in a single lump sum, payable twelve (12) months following the date on which
benefit payments commence under the Qualified Pension Plan; 

(iii) 
       
     in a single lump sum payable twenty-four (24) months following the date on
which benefit payments commence under the Qualified Pension Plan; 

(iv) 
       
     in two equal installments (each being equal to one-half of the lump sum amount
described in clause (i) above), the first installment payable on the date on which
benefit payments commence under the Qualified Pension Plan, and the second installment
payable twelve (12) months following the date on which benefit payments commence under
the Qualified Pension Plan; or 

(v) 
       
     in two equal installments (each being equal to one-half of the lump sum amount
described in clause (ii) above), the first installment payable twelve (12) months
following the date on which benefit payments commence under the Qualified Pension Plan,
and the second installment payable twenty-four (24) months following the date on which
benefit payments commence under the Qualified Pension Plan. 

(b) In the event that any eligible Officer or Managing Director elects to receive a lump sum
or installment benefit under subsection (a) above, the amount of each such distribution shall be
calculated as of the Annuity Starting Date. The amount of the lump sum distribution payable under
this Section 5(b) shall be calculated based upon the benefit payable as of the Annuity Starting
Date by using an interest rate equal to the annual interest rate on thirty (30) year Treasury
Constant Maturities as published in Federal Reserve releases G.13 and H.15 in effect for the second
(2nd) month before the month in which the beginning of the Plan Year in which the calculation is
performed (which shall be the stability period for purposes of the Plan) and the mortality table
set forth in Revenue Ruling 2001-62, based on a blend of fifty percent (50%) of the male and female
mortality rates set forth in the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving Table ( 94 GAR ).

(c) An eligible Officer or Managing Director may revoke the election made in this section and
elect another manner in which his or her benefit from this Plan shall be payable, but only if such
revocation and subsequent election occur no later than twelve (12) months prior to the date on
which benefits commence under the Qualified Pension Plan with respect to such Officer or Managing
Director.

(d) If the value of the annuity benefit payable to an Officer or Managing Director is less
than $100 per month, the benefit payable to such Officer or Managing Director may be paid as a lump
sum.

Section 6.   Payment of Benefits: Benefits Accrued After December 31, 2004, but
Commencing Prior to January 1, 2009 .

The Traditional Pension Benefit provided under this Plan which is accrued by an eligible
Officer or Managing Director after December 31, 2004 shall be paid as a single lump sum no earlier
than the later of (i) six (6) months following the eligible Officer s or Managing Director s
Separation From Service, or (ii) his or her attainment of age 55. The amount of the lump sum
distribution shall be calculated as of the later of the Officer s or Managing Director s attainment
of age 55 or Separation From Service. The amount of the lump sum distribution payable under this
Section 6 shall be calculated based upon the benefit payable as of the later of the Officer s or
Managing Director s Separation From Service or attainment of age 55 by using an interest rate equal
to the annual interest rate on thirty (30) year Treasury Constant Maturities as published in
Federal Reserve releases G.13 and H.15 in effect for the second (2nd) month before the month in
which the beginning of the Plan Year in which the calculation is performed (which shall be the
stability period for purposes of the Plan) and the mortality table set forth in Revenue Ruling
2001-62, based on a blend of fifty percent (50%) of the male and female mortality rates set forth
in the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving Table ( 94 GAR ).

The Portable Pension Account Benefit provided under this Plan which is accrued by an eligible
Officer or Managing Director after December 31, 2004 shall be calculated as of the date of the
Officer s or Managing Director s Separation From Service and paid as a single lump sum no earlier
than six (6) months following the eligible Officer s or Managing Director s Separation From
Service.

Separation From Service  means a termination of substantial services for the Company. For
purposes of applying the provisions of Code Section 409A, a reference to the Company shall also be
deemed a reference to any affiliate thereof within the contemplation of Code Sections 414(b) and
414(c). A substantial employment relationship shall be considered to exist for so long as an
individual is on an authorized leave of absence of up to six (6) months or, if longer, for so long
as the individual retains a right to re-employment by law or contract. An individual who is on an
authorized leave of absence shall not in any event be deemed to have a Separation From Service for
so long as the Company has a reasonable expectation that the individual will again perform
substantial services for the Company in any capacity, whether or not as an employee of the Company.
An individual will not be treated as having incurred a Separation From Service where the
individual s level of future services for the Company is reasonably
anticipated by the Company to exceed 20% of the average level of bona fide Company services
provided by that individual in any capacity for the prior 36 month period, or the prior period of
services if less, but will be treated as having incurred a Separation From Service at any time when
such reasonably anticipated level of future services is equal to or less than such 20% average
level of prior services.

Section 7.   Payment of Benefits Commencing On or After January 1, 2009 .

(a) The Traditional Pension Benefit provided under this Plan which is accrued by an eligible
Officer or Managing Director shall be paid as a single lump sum no earlier than the later of (i)
six (6) months following the later of the eligible Officer s or Managing Director s Separation From
Service, (ii) his or her attainment of age 55, or (iii) as of January 1, 2009, with respect to
Officers and Managing Directors who have incurred a Separation From Service but who had not
commenced benefits prior to January 1, 2009.

The amount of the lump sum distribution payable under this Section 7(a) shall be calculated
based upon the benefit payable as of the later of the Officer s or Managing Director s Separation
From Service or attainment of age 55 by using an interest rate equal to the annual interest rate on
thirty (30) year Treasury Constant Maturities as published in Federal Reserve releases G.13 and
H.15 in effect for the second (2nd) month before the month in which the beginning of the Plan Year
in which the calculation is performed (which shall be the stability period for purposes of the
Plan) and the mortality table set forth in Revenue Ruling 2001-62, based on a blend of fifty
percent (50%) of the male and female mortality rates set forth in the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving
Table ( 94 GAR ).

10 shall neither impair nor extinguish any rights of any participating Officer or Managing Director
with respect to any claim for benefits payable under this Plan.

Section 14.   No Guarantee of Employment . Nothing contained in this Plan shall
be construed as a contract of employment between a participating employer and any Officer or

Mr. Smith s fiscal 2009 base salary is effective as of July 16, 2008. The fiscal 2009 base
salaries of the other named executive officers are effective as of July 1, 2008.

Fiscal 2009 Annual Incentive Compensation Plans 

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 

Frederick W. Smith s fiscal 2009 annual bonus will be determined by the achievement of
corporate objectives for fully diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) for fiscal 2009. The independent
members of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may
adjust Mr. Smith s bonus amount upward or downward based on their evaluation of Mr. Smith s
performance, including the quality and effectiveness of his leadership and the following corporate
performance measures:

FedEx s stock price performance relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite Index,
the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and competitors; 

FedEx s stock price to earnings (P/E) ratio relative to the Standard   Poor s 500
Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and competitors; 

FedEx s market capitalization; 

FedEx s revenue and operating income growth relative to competitors; 

FedEx s free cash flow (excluding business acquisitions), return on invested capital
(excluding certain unusual items), and weighted average cost of capital; 

Analyst coverage and ratings for FedEx s stock; 

FedEx s U.S. and international revenue market share; and 

FedEx s reputation rankings by various publications and surveys. 

None of these factors will be given any particular weight in determining whether to adjust Mr.
Smith s bonus amount.

Mr. Smith s annual bonus target for fiscal 2009 is 130% of his base salary, with a maximum payout
of 300% of his target bonus.

Non-CEO Named Executive Officers 

The fiscal 2009 annual bonus target payouts for the non-CEO named executive officers, as a
percentage of base salary, are as follows:

The maximum payout for each executive is 240% of his target bonus.

The fiscal 2009 annual bonus for the non-CEO named executive officers will be based on:

the achievement of individual objectives established at the beginning of the fiscal year
for each executive (30% of each executive s target bonus); and 

the achievement of corporate objectives for EPS for fiscal 2009 (70% of each executive s
target bonus). 

The annual bonus payout opportunity relating to individual performance is contingent upon
achievement of EPS objectives under the bonus plan (as well as achievement of the
individual performance objectives). Mr. Smith will determine the achievement level of each
executive s individual objectives at the conclusion of fiscal 2009.

The annual bonus payout opportunity relating to company financial performance ranges, on a
sliding scale, from a minimum amount if the annual bonus plan s pre-established EPS threshold is
achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goal is substantially exceeded.

2 

Long-Term Incentive Program  

FedEx s long-term incentive ( LTI ) plans for the three-fiscal-year periods 2007 through 2009,
2008 through 2010 and 2009 through 2011, provide long-term cash bonus opportunities to members of
upper management, including the named executive officers, for fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011,
respectively, if certain aggregate EPS goals established by the Board of Directors are achieved
with respect to those periods. No amounts can be earned for the fiscal 2007 through 2009, 2008
through 2010 and 2009 through 2011 plans until 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, because
achievement of the EPS goals can only be determined following the conclusion of the applicable
three-fiscal-year period.

FedEx acquired Kinko s, Inc. (now known as FedEx Office) in fiscal 2004. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008, FedEx recorded a charge of approximately
$891 million ($696 million, net of tax, or
$2.23 per diluted share), predominantly for impairment of the value
of the Kinko s trade name and the
goodwill recorded as a result of the Kinko s acquisition. The Board of Directors, upon the
recommendation of its Compensation Committee, decided that this charge would be excluded from
fiscal 2008 EPS for the purposes of (i) determining achievement levels under the LTI plans for the
three-fiscal-year periods 2007 through 2009 and 2008 through 2010, and (ii) setting EPS goals under
the LTI plan for the three-fiscal-year period 2009 through 2011.

The following table sets forth estimates of the possible future payouts to each of FedEx s
named executive officers under FedEx s LTI plans:

3 

The estimated individual future payouts set forth in the table above are set dollar amounts
ranging from threshold (minimum) amounts, if the EPS goal achieved is less than target, up to
maximum amounts, if the plan goal is substantially exceeded. There can be no assurance that the
estimated future payouts shown in this table will be achieved.

Other Arrangements  

FedEx s named executive officers are eligible to receive certain other annual compensation,
including certain perquisites and other personal benefits, such as personal use of corporate
aircraft (though the officers are required to reimburse FedEx for substantially all of the
incremental cost of such usage), security services and equipment (pursuant to FedEx s executive
security procedures) and tax return preparation and financial counseling services.

In addition, FedEx s named executive officers receive tax reimbursement payments relating to
restricted stock awards, certain business-related use of corporate aircraft and certain
perquisites.
